"AITAH for ""robbing"" my wife's affair partner which has now lead to his divorce?","I (32) have been married to my soon to be ex-wife (30), Madison, for four years. We are currently in counseling but it is not going to work.

About a year ago I found out she was having an affair by coming home to their clothes in our living room and sounds coming from our bedroom.

I lost it. I was getting my cricket bat out of the front closet when I stopped to think about consequences. I did not want to go to jail.

Instead I took all their clothes and left quietly. I went to a friend's house but not before throwing all the clothes in a McDonald's garbage can.

I turned off my phone and got shitfaced with my buddy. His wife hosed us off in the morning.

After I turned my phone back on I had dozens of calls and texts from Madison. First scared because she got my updated flight information. Then upset that I hadn't called her to let her know I was going to be coming home early. Then freaked out that the house had been broken into. Then crazy because she figured out it was me. They just got more deranged.

The guy she was with is five inches shorter than me and about 60 pounds lighter. So if he had taken my clothes it would be obvious.

He ended up calling his friend to go get his spare keys from his house. Unfortunately for him his wife smelled a rat and followed his friend back to my house. Where she saw him leaving in oversized clothes.

Long story short she took pictures and she had evidence of his infidelity. Which caused their prenup to be cancelled. Which cost him a lot of money. It is all one big giant shit show.

It took a couple of months but my wife convinced me to try and forgive her. We started going to counseling and we were working our way through it. Until recently.

In a counseling session she said that I was wrong to steal his wallet, phone, and car keys. She said that his divorce is costing him a lot of money and that I should have dealt with it in a more mature manner and that it was my fault.

I have never admitted to taking his stuff. To begin with I was afraid he might call the cops. Then I didn't want to give her ammunition in case she wanted a divorce. Now I just don't care.

I told her that her cheating was the reason her boyfriend is getting divorced. And that I hope his ex takes everything.

I am still not living at home. I have my own apartment and I'm filing for divorce. Now that I know how she feels it is kind of a slap in the face that she is blaming me for his divorce.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1cajlmm/aitah_for_robbing_my_wifes_affair_partner_which/,ResearchIll9654,2024-04-23 00:20:53,35461,AITAH
TIFU driving naked,"Throwaway account in case I regret this post as much as I regret what prompted it. TL:DR below. Sorry for the length. Didn't realize all this word vomit would end up being somehat cathartic. 

Last night I decided to get into my car completely naked. I had one job. Meet my gf at her place. Drive us back to my place. End of story. No stripping required. However. As the day was coming to an end, the anticipation of spending time alone with my gf was clouding my judgment. All of a sudden I was horny and thinking it would be kind of kinky to show up naked behind the wheel and saying something silly like ""excuse me, ma'am... did you call an Uber X?"". I was rock hard thinking about the risk factor and how my gf would react. I imagined her laughing at the absurdity but also being somewhat turned on by the nudity. I wasn't too worried about other people catching me because my plan was not to interact with anyone else and to stay in the car until I was back inside my garage. 

I realized I fucked up the moment I pulled into the parking bay and noticed my gf standing in the rain with an umbrella and her two roommates huddled underneath. All of them were frantically waving at me like ""OMG, please hurry, it's pouring"". I had two choices. Proceed as planned and accept my fate. Or preserve my dignity and leave my gf and her roommates in the rain. I drove my naked ass out of there feeling conflicted as fuck. In my defense, there was never any mention of roommates joining us. My gf called and assumed I didn't see them somehow. I apologized and explained, albeit fearfully, why she just witnessed me drive away without her. I promised I'd be back to pick them up in 30 minutes or less. Fully dressed. It was tricky trying to pinpoint if my gf was entertained or annoyed during that phone call. That being said, I couldn't help but feel like I was pushing her buttons when I asked her to lie to her roommates about my reason for fleeing the premises. 

My gf said it wouldn't be necessary to tell lies because she had me on loudspeaker the entire time. Crickets. I fucking died inside. I could hear the roommates laughing in the background before one of them said ""tell him to turn around"". At that moment, another call came through. Unknown number. My saving grace. Or so I thought. I said goodbye to my gf and discovered it was my mother who didn't realize she was still using her work phone after hours. My mom asked where I was because she just arrived at my place. I said I wasn't home and stressed what a bad time it was for her to pop in unannounced. She said she had leftover lasagna for me. My favourite. I said I'd be home in a few minutes and made it clear that when I arrive I'm gonna drive directly into my garage and open the front door from the inside. I emphasized that she should remain in her car, out of the rain, and under no circumstances should she approach me until she saw me in the house looking decent. 

My mom approached me as soon as she heard me honk. Her vehicle was blocking my driveway but instead of getting out of the way so I could access my garage and avoid being seen in the nude, she got out of her car without warning and marched to my car with a plate of lasagna wrapped in tinfoil. I was tempted to drive away again, but I didn't have the balls to abandon both women in my life on the same night in the same way. I rolled down my window and said ""mother, stop"". She did not stop. Not until she realized I was wearing nothing but my seat belt. I asked her to please move her vehicle and not ask questions. She caught me naked. Of course she asked questions. Lots of questions. 

I made it sound like it was nothing more than a dumb prank between friends but my mom was convinced I was under the influence of her nemesis, Satan. I knew what that meant. She was using Satan as a metaphor to describe my gf, which she's done before. Usually I'd bite and we would argue but I didn't have time to dive into that debate because once I was done getting dressed, I had to leave again. On my way out, my mom proceeded to pray out loud. I froze at the door and had to wait until she was done updating God about yet another classic example of how her son was being tempted by the flesh into committing acts of indecency. As usual it was over the top theatrics and passive aggressive slut shaming towards my gf. Somehow all of this was her fault, not mine, I was just a victim of a Jezebel. It took everything in my power not to lose my shit during that prayer.  

Fast forward to the most uncomfortable car ride of my life. My gf didn't really make conversation (or eye contact) other than asking if I didn't mind dropping her roommates at the mall. I could tell she was embarrassed by me. It was my first time meeting her roommates in person and it was obvious they didn't know how to behave around me. I apologized to all of them for my actions and promised never to leave my house naked again. Not gonna lie, acknowledging what I did made it even more awkward. I got zero replies. Just forced smiles. My gf turned on the radio instead of talking to me. Due to the bad weather we had one radio station available. A talk station. So, there we all were, awkwardly listening to people who suffer from misophonia discuss how disturbing specific sex sounds were to them. Fuck last night. 

**TL:DR Made plans to pick up my gf. Got horny thinking about her. Decided to drive naked as a sexy surprise. Realized my gf was waiting for me with her roommates. Left them all in the rain to go home and put on something to wear. Got caught by my religious mom who happened to be at my house. Had to listen to her badmouth my gf with Satan metaphors and prayer. Got dressed. Returned to my gf and her roommates. Cue awkward car ride.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/nxbd1o/tifu_driving_naked/,NeverGoNakedAtNight,2021-06-11 13:56:28,34986,tifu

I Killed My Bearded Dragon,"I got Pancake from a guy i knew in high school. She was very unhealthy, likely very inbred since she was from a petco, as well as i believe she was UV deficient during developmental years. I did my best with her and I managed to get her to a healthy state, but she always had issues with her digestion. I got her at the age of 2 and she just died today around 6 or 7. She’s the only reptile i’ve ever owned, and I believe I did the best I could. Regular baths, lots of healthy greens with some fruit, crickets for protein. 

She had a  visit to the vet about a year ago and they said she was perfectly healthy. The only thing I can think of is that I over fed her crickets and she became impacted. I knew about this condition, but I had always avoided it with regular massages and doing my best to balance her diet. However this last time I bought her large crickets instead of medium without thinking about it. That was my mistake. The exoskeletons were too much for her to pass and she died in the middle of the night. Was happy as a clam yesterday. Ran around the room with my girlfriend and I appearing to be healthy. I noticed she couldn’t poop yesterday, but that’s always been an issue for her so I didn’t think twice. 

I assumed she’d pass it the next day. I was wrong and had I simply massaged the bolus and broken it apart, i suspect she’d still be alive. I can make all the excuses I want like I didn’t know any better and I’ve never owned a reptile before, but I still feel like shit because she died of a preventable cause due to my lack of recognition of a serious medical emergency.

Sorry for the tangent but I suppose it’s somewhat cathartic to talk about it online. I loved her and I will always love my bearded dragon Pancake. I’d like to think she lived a better life than she was before and that she was happy, but it’s a shame she had to fall into the hands of a dumbass like me. Rest in peace my little girl.",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1emgijc,nszajk,2024-08-07 21:35:28,33199,Wellthatsucks
Boomers are mad at… boomers.,"My work had a presentation last week from the department of workforce services. The meeting was about 60 boomers and maybe 10-20 younger people. Most of them were republican from some of the comments I heard through other presenters. 

The presenter gets to the labor shortage and asks what people think is the reason for it. “No one wants to work” “Lazy young people” “Too much free money” “Everyone wants to work from home” (Not sure what this last one has to do with it) 

Imagine all of their surprise when he presents scientific evidence that the cause is boomers retiring. Further, boomers retired and have all this wealth that younger generations don’t even begin to compare to. Lastly, boomers, and following generations, didn’t have enough kids to replace them when they got older and retired so now it’s impossible to have enough people to replace them.

A Customer Was Upset I Didn't Give Her The Right Amount of Fish; She Was Right.,"I used to work at a mom & pop store that sold clothes, farm supplies, animals and sporting goods. Anyway, since we sold sporting goods we also sold bait fish. Fisherman would frequently stop by our store to buy them to fish with and they were sold by the dozen. Usually, when I  scooped bait, I would give a few extra fish to my customers. I had one Russian lady come in to purchase bait fish, so just as I normally did, I scooped a net full of fish and started dumping them in the bag counting them individually, and added a few extra to the bag. The lady watched me do this but insisted that I did not give her the correct amount. I assured her that I not only gave her the dozen she paid for but I gave her a few extra. I literally just counted and have done this long enough that I was really good at eyeing when it was over a dozen. This lady just kept insisting that I didn't give her enough so I said, "" Okay, let's count together just to be sure.""  


So I dump all the fish from the bag back into the net and we started counting together very slowly ""1....2...3...4...ect..."" We get to 12 and it's very clear there are several extra fish still in the net. I  look up at her and I was like ""Ohhh you were right, I didn't give you the right amount."" I then proceeded to dump the remaining fish back into the tank right in front of her and gave her exactly the amount she paid for.

Update: She ended up just looking bewildered when I handed the fish back to her and left. Really nothing more she could have done at that point but I did start applying this philosophy to the customers who bought crickets.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/w9o4at/a_customer_was_upset_i_didnt_give_her_the_right/,rcam_tv,2022-07-28 00:49:06,26716,MaliciousCompliance

Thank you guys for the responses. 

I tried talking to her again and she apologized but I could tell that she wasn't really sorry. She only did it because she ""had to"" if that makes sense. I asked her how she would respond if we had a son and god forbid something happened to him. She didn't even respond. It reminded me of the way my parents responded when I told them. Crickets. I was 13 when I told them. In fact they still keep contact with the woman, a family friend who was like an aunt to me. 

I broke up with her and explained to her why. She was pissed. Called me every name in the book and said that it's fine because she didn't even like me that much anyway. I don't know how much of that is true or if she's saying it out of anger but I don't care. Any doubt I felt about breaking up vanished with her response. I was fully willing to work on our relationship and give it another shot but I guess I cared more about her than she did about me. 

I'm gonna stay with my sister for now. I think I need to be single. For some reason I've always been quick to jump into relationships and they all fail. My now ex gf and I had some other issues that we've tried working through but I can't work through this. I'm just gonna focus on myself moving forward. I've heard everything she's said before from both men and women but having it directed at me from someone I care about really hurt. It's not something I could let go.I've dealt with a lot of confusion and guilt surrounding what happened that made me question myself. I didn't like what was happening to me but my body would react. This really messed me up.

I'm gonna work through my issues before I even think of another relationship.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/i3izig/update_my_girlfriend_24_f_doesnt_believe_that_i/,ThrowRA_625,2020-08-04 18:07:43,22874,relationship_advice

TIFU by switching geckos and making my science teacher think her gecko is immortal,"When I was in seventh grade, I had this funny science teacher who loved to show off her collection of pets that ranged from a couple of bunnies to little hamsters in her classroom (she wasn't allowed and had to let go most of her pets a few years later). One of the pets was a leopard gecko. At that time, I was very into reptiles so I was very interested in the gecko. Let's call him Tom. 

Anyway, because she had so many animals, she would have her students volunteer to take them home on holidays and care for them. One of her rules is that you can only volunteer once so that everyone else can have a turn. I decided to wait until summer to volunteer for the gecko because that would be the longest holiday so I can maximize my time with the gecko. 

Summer came and I brought the gecko home with me. It didn't move a lot or hunt the crickets that I put in it's tank so I had to feed him by putting the cricket directly in front of his mouth with a pair of tweezers (that I never used for myself again). Tom got really lethargic about two weeks into the summer and the next day when I looked into his tank, he was dead. I freaked out. 

I cried and bawled to my mom about what happened and how my science teacher was going to hate me. Mom suddenly had an idea and we went to a pet store (not before we buried Tom in a box in our garden). We went to two different pet stores before we found a matured leopard gecko that was identical to Tom. Same size and patterns so we brought him and named him Tom. 

Fast forward to end of summer and I had to return ""Tom."" I was so ashamed of what I had done that I couldn't look at my science teacher in the eye even when she thanked me for caring for ""Tom"" over the summer. 

Fast forward again to first year university. I was scrolling down Facebook when I saw my old seventh grade science teacher posted something on her fb (we became friends after I graduated). She stated that her leopard gecko have lived a very long life of thirty-oneish years (and was probably the oldest one in the world) but now was over the rainbow bridge. She was so proud to have the gecko for that long. 

I haven't had the heart to tell her that it wasn't the same gecko. But she probably knows now because she passed away last year so she's probably hanging out with two geckos. 

TL;DR The gecko died under my care so I switched the gecko for a live one so my science teacher wouldn't hate me.

EDIT: Thanks for the awards guys! And from what I can understand, it seems that this is a common problem among middle school science teachers lol.

"Reggie Miller on Kyrie: ""The players have dropped the ball on this case when it’s been one of their own. It’s been crickets. And it’s disappointing, because this league has been built on the shoulders of the players being advocates""",">On TNT’s Nets-Bulls broadcast on Tuesday, the matter was discussed for several minutes in the first quarter in a discussion including Miller, play-by-play broadcaster Brian Anderson and sideline reporter Jared Greenberg.

>“In years past, this league has been great because the players have led the way and they have strong voices,” Miller said. “When Donald Sterling stepped in it, when Robert Sarver just recently stepped in it, our voices in the basketball community and our players were vocally strong in some type of discipline being handed down — or be gone.

>“The players have dropped the ball on this case when it’s been one of their own. It’s been crickets,” Miller added. “And it’s disappointing, because this league has been built on the shoulders of the players being advocates. Right is right and wrong is wrong. And if you’re gonna call out owners, and rightfully so, then you’ve got to call out players as well. You can’t go silent in terms of this for Kyrie Irving. I want to hear the players and their strong opinions as well, just as we heard about Robert Sarver and Donald Sterling.”

"YSK: Most advertising is not intended to make you immediately want to buy the product. The vast majority is ""brand marketing"", which is simply intended to make you familiar with the product, which makes you more likely to purchase it in the future.","Have you ever seen an ad and wondered, ""Who's going to want to go buy a bag of Doritos after watching _that?_""

As a consumer, it's important to understand the difference between **brand** and **direct** marketing, so you're aware of how marketing is influencing your consumer behavior and help you make informed choices.

Direct marketing is something like an infomercial, or a podcast ad with a promo code.  There is a very clear call to action in the ad, (_""Use our promo code to get 15% off""_ or _""Call now and try yours today!""_).  The ad attempts to be persuasive, so you're actually likely to immediately go and buy the thing.

But, the _vast majority_ of all marketing is ""brand marketing"", whose purpose is simply to make you aware of and familiar with the product.  The idea is that the next time you need to buy that type of thing (maybe you're at the store in the paper towel aisle), you'll instinctively and subconsciously start with a brand you're familiar with.  You probably won't even recall seeing an ad for it, but you might look at the options and think, ""I've never even heard of PaperPal, it can't be good. Oh look, Bounty! I know them"".  You might think it's because you saw them at a friend's house, but you probably just saw them in an ad.  This sounds crazy, and you might be thinking ""I'd never fall for that"", but _it works_.  It works so well that billions of dollars a year are spent on brand advertising alone.

So, the next time you're wondering how on earth an ad about an ostrich playing cricket could possibly make you want to buy life insurance, remember that it's probably brand advertising.  And later, when you're evaluating life insurance options, make sure you're actually choosing the best value, not just the one with the name you recognize.  You probably recognize it because because you've seen ads for it.


**EDIT:** To all the people claiming advertising doesn’t work on them, please be advised: thinking this way will only make brand advertising more effective on you.  If you’re convinced you’re never buying something because of advertising, you’ll be falsely attributing that familiar feeling to a different source (a friend, a review, an imagined experience), when it was in fact probably just an ad campaign.  This is a brand marketer’s _dream_.  Just accept that advertising (in all its forms, shelf placement, billboards, online, etc) is indeed having some effect and adjust accordingly.",https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/f2bdyv/ysk_most_advertising_is_not_intended_to_make_you/,Fredifrum,2020-02-11 22:11:48,16709,YouShouldKnow

I saw 192 movies in theaters in 2019. Here is my full ranking.,"This year I went to see 192 different movies in theaters, plus one rewatch. That's up from 162 in 2018, 140 in 2017, 9 in 2016, and 5 in 2015. I usually go 3 or 4 times per week, mostly on weekends. I keep track of dates/theaters/movies/ratings for fun and save all of the stubs.

My ratings are what I give the movie right after seeing it, with no real 'checklist' or anything, mostly just initial thought/enjoyment/opinion. It's not meant to be taken super seriously, I'm not a professional reviewer.

This is my full ranking for the year, from favorite to least-favorite, with a few small reviews/thoughts thrown in:

--------------------------------------------------------

**Monos - 10/10** - *Hands-down my favorite movie of the year and honestly high on my all-time list. It's Apocalypse Now meets Lord of the Flies, with some Beasts of No Nation thrown in. It builds a unique, lived-in world that's believable and brutal. Beautifully-filmed, some of the best shots of the year (the ending shot gets seared in your mind). Modern and grounded look at a militia/cartel fighting against an unnamed enemy in a Colombian jungle. It almost feels post-apocalyptic instead of 'cartel vs government', which I really loved. You get to imagine your own backstory as the story unfolds. Unforgiving and gut-wrenching, but hopeful too. Got a lot out of its cast. Can't recommend this movie enough. Really disappointed this didn't make the Best Foreign Language Film shortlist. ""Masterpiece"" gets thrown around a lot, but in my mind this is the only one this year.*

**Marriage Story - 10/10**

**The Farewell - 10/10**

**Journey to a Mother's Room - 9/10** - *Biggest surprise of the year, came out of nowhere. Deeply-personal story between a mother & daughter. It's very basic on the surface, and there's not much story (you start at Point A, and end at Point A), but it's the most emotional movie of the year. If you don't cry at least 3 times during this, you're probably not human. It's all about the unbreakable connection you have to your parent(s), from the day you're born until the day you die. It only takes place over the course of a few months, but feels like lifetimes. Beautiful little movie about separation, loss, and human connection.*

**Waves - 9/10** - *I could write 20 pages on how much I loved this movie. To keep it short, it's got a perfect soundtrack, perfect setting, awards-worthy performances (from Kelvin Harrison Jr., Sterling K. Brown, and Taylor Russell). Visceral story that grips you from the first minute and doesn't let go until the closing shot. Unique use of colors and aspect-ratio. It takes a huge risk structurally that pays off. It's also the only movie I went to see twice this year. Really worth it too, picked up on a lot of stuff on the second viewing. Would've went a third time if theaters kept it playing longer. Every tiny decision/action has a huge impact. Just watch this.*

**Last Black Man In San Francisco - 9/10**

**Birds of Passage - 9/10**

**Apollo 11 - 9/10** - *The best documentary of the year. Probably the best editing (and use of sound) I've ever seen/heard in a documentary. It's unique because they don't use interviews like most documentaries do, it's real sound the whole through. Impressive use of archival footage/audio.*

**Uncut Gems - 9/10** - *This movie wasn't on the Best Original Score shortlist for the 2020 Oscars. This aggression will not stand.*

**The Mustang - 9/10**

**Wild Rose - 9/10** - *If this doesn't win the Oscar for Best Original Song ('Glasgow'), I've lost all faith in the Academy. The ending concert scene had me crying like a baby. Jessie Buckley is gonna be big. Best music-drama since A Star Is Born.*

**Transit  - 9/10**

**Ad Astra - 9/10** - *Top-notch acting, great atmosphere, world-building, existentialism, beautiful VFX, engaging score. Best opening scene of the year. Thoughtful commentary on modern society all wrapped in a Heart of Darkness blanket. If you're into space/exploration movies, then I recommend this. Surprised at the backlash this movie has gotten on /r/movies.*

**The Report  - 9/10** - *This was a really good year for legal-thrillers and The Report was the cream of the crop. Tight, Sorkin-like script with top performances from Adam Driver & Annette Bening. Could change a lot of minds about the war on terror and use of torture.*

**Parasite - 9/10**

**Once Upon A Time In Hollywood - 9/10**

**Midnight Traveler - 9/10** - *If you feel like life is unfair and the odds are stacked against you, watch this movie. It puts everything in a different perspective. Every problem you have is going to seem minuscule compared to what this family went through. It's eye-opening and should fill you with anger.*

**Luce - 9/10** - *It's Kelvin Harrison Jr's world and we're just living in it.*

**The Irishman - 8/10**

**Mickey and the Bear - 8/10** - *Camila Morrone puts in the best breakout performance of the year. PTSD, drug-addiction, alcoholism, rural Montana, toxic relationships, James Badge Dale, following your dreams. What's not to love?*

**The Art of Self Defense - 8/10** - *The best dark-comedy of the year. So many great one liners. It's like Yorgos Lanthimos directing Death of Stalin, set in a karate studio. Surprisingly violent and depressing, but in all the right ways. Jesse Eisenberg's best movie since.....The Social Network?*

**Peanut Butter Falcon - 8/10** - *""Am I going to die?"" ""We all do, it's only a 
matter of time, now stop being a little bitch."" - Favorite line of the year, really stuck with me.*

**Everybody Knows - 8/10**

**Mary Magdalene - 8/10**

**Knives Out - 8/10** - *Well-crafted whoddunit with an ensemble cast. Just a genuinely fun time at the movies. Ana de Armas with well-deserved leading role for once. A few of the characters are a tad bit unrealistic (and basically caricatures), but the movie doesn't take itself seriously enough for that to be a problem. Daniel Craig hamming it up with a Southern accent was fun. Old school film with a modern twist.*

**The Lighthouse - 8/10** 

**The Dead Don't Die - 8/10** - *This movie really isn't for everyone, but I loved the dry humor and purposefully-bad chemistry/dialogue. The line delivery was off-putting but hilarious. Everything is extremely on-the-nose and it works. I could watch 10 hours of Tom Waits talking to himself.*

**Us - 8/10**

**Villains - 8/10**

**Ford v Ferrari  - 8/10** 

**Midsommar - 8/10**

**Jojo Rabbit  - 8/10** 

**Official Secrets - 8/10** - *Keira Knightley with one of the most underrated performances of the year. Another really good legal/political-thriller that exposes the dark side of government bureaucracy.*

**Pain & Glory - 8/10** 

**John Wick 3: Parabellum - 8/10**

**Queen & Slim - 8/10**

**Amazing Grace - 8/10** - *Great concert-documentary. Some of Aretha Franklin's performances in this should give you insane chills. I actually had this one rated higher right after watching it, but then looked up some of the people shown on screen and it turns out some were real pieces of shit, while preaching to people like hypocrits. Felt gross and took a lot of the magic out. One of my few revised scores this year.*

**A Beautiful Day In The Neighborhood - 8/10**

**Joker - 8/10**

**Non-Fiction - 8/10** - *It's very French (talky and sexual) and the writing seems impressed with itself,  but it's a good adult-drama that surprised me. I'm a big fan of Olivier Assayas and this is some of his best work.*

**Rocketman - 8/10**

**Stan & Ollie - 8/10**

**Hustlers - 8/10**

**Avengers Endgame - 8/10**

**Doctor Sleep - 8/10** - *It gets bloated and probably needed to be 20-30 minutes shorter (there's a shit ton of side-characters), but it was a worthwhile sequel to The Shining. Didn't feel like a cash grab and carries its own weight.*

**Booksmart - 8/10** 

**Little Monsters  - 8/10** - *I'd recommend watching this based just on Josh Gad's character. So over-the-top and hilarious. When he starts chugging hand sanitizer might be the most I laughed in a theater this year. Also Lupita Nyong'o playing & singing on the ukulele to a bunch of kids is exactly what I needed in my life. Cute zombie-comedy with a ton of heart.*

**Spider-Man: Far From Home - 8/10**

**A Hidden Life - 8/10** - *If there's a song from this year (or this decade even) that I'd want played at my funeral, it's James Newton Howard's theme from this movie. It's so beautiful and perfectly captures the feel of the movie. That song broke me down every time it played. I can't imagine this movie without it, it's that good. It's a shame this movie is getting ignored this awards season.*

**Never Look Away - 8/10**

**Toy Story 4 - 8/10**

**Pavarotti - 8/10**

**The Biggest Little Farm - 8/10**-  *If you're really into the inner-workings of a Californian farm, then this is the documentary for you.*

**Abominable - 8/10**  

**The Current War - 7/10** 

**Artic  - 7/10** - *Well made, solidly-acted. I loved the small details about survival that this movie brings up, makes it very grounded and realistic. I'm kinda bored of survival movies in general so this didn't blow my mind or anything.*

**Bombshell - 7/10**

**Honey Boy - 7/10** - *Pretty big letdown because I had really high expectations for this one. Lacked the emotional punch I hoped for. Didn't land for me at all, kind of like Boy Erased last year. I appreciate how honest and revealing it was, took a lot of guts for Shia LaBeouf to put this out there but it's forgettable. Lucas Hedges' Shia impression was reallllly on point though, that was worth the price of admission right there. Mid90s last year was a 10/10 for me and I expected the same for this. It was good, not great.*

**American Woman - 7/10** - *Sienna Miller's performance in this is awards-worthy. The accent she does is perfect and it might be the most underrated role of the year. The movie gets way too tearjerky at the end though. It's basically 2 hours of bad shit happening to a good person, which gets a bit overwhelming.*

**The Beach Bum - 7/10**

**Captain Marvel - 7/10**

**Spies In Disguise - 7/10** - *Looked pretty generic based on the trailer, but was actually pretty funny.*

**Cold Pursuit - 7/10**

**Tolkien - 7/10** - *Not much happens but it felt really comfortable. Solid performances all around and they handled the WW1 scenes better than I thought they would. Expected to be bored out of my mind based on the reviews and trailer but it flowed well. As far as ""Nicholas Hoult Biopics of Famous Writers"" go, it's miles ahead of Rebel in the Rye 2 years ago.*

**Jumanji: The Next Level - 7/10**

**Sauvage/Wild - 7/10**

**Detective Pikachu - 7/10**

**Maiden - 7/10**

**Dark Waters - 7/10** - . *Good performances and an okay script, even though it beats you over the head sometimes. Total waste of Anne Hathaway. She's way too good of an actress for a boring, generic, 'supporting wife' role with just a few lines. Not even sure why she was in this. Overall, a solid legal-thriller, which is a genre I really enjoy and I've been missing since its late-90s heyday. Pretty crazy story too, scummy and evil corporate greed is always interesting to explore on film (like The Insider). Should've been 20 minutes shorter and less on-the-nose*

**Adopt A Highway - 7/10**

**The Wedding Guest - 7/10**

**The Hummingbird Project - 7/10**

**Motherless Brooklyn - 7/10**

**The Lion King - 7/10**

**Last Christmas - 7/10** - *It's really easy to bash this movie, a lot of the humor falls flat and the twist is ridiculous, but I couldn't help walking out with a smile. I love how committed Emilia Clarke was to the character, and her interactions with her boss and family were legitimately heart-warming at times. Also did I mention how ridiculous that twist is?*

**Richard Jewell  - 7/10** - *This was decent. Even though it's clearly Clint Eastwood's personal crusade (and thinly-veiled propaganda piece in some regards) against the FBI & the Spooky Media™, it still told the story effectively/semi-believably. Some of the characters (Hamm/Wilde obviously) were pretty ridiculous caricatures though, was hard to take anything they said seriously, I mean come on. You just roll your eyes at most of what they say. Some of the situations and encounters are too-conveniently set-up but that's easy to overlook. It had very solid performances (Hauser was great, especially when he finally let's his emotion show, in that scene where he kicks the table). Much better than The Mule, and 20x better than 15:17 To Paris.*

**Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker - 7/10**

**21 Bridges - 7/10**

**Before You Know It - 7/10**

**Hobbs & Shaw - 7/10** - *This is peak ""Stupid Summer Popcorn Movie"" and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's The Meg of 2019*.

**Fighting With My Family - 7/10**

**Pet Sematary  - 7/10**

**Downton Abbey - 7/10** - *Never saw a single episode of the show before watching the movie, but it still felt familiar/safe to jump right in.*

**Yesterday - 7/10**

**Greta  - 7/10** - *It's a cheesy, predictable, non-scary horror film but I liked it. Sometimes you just need Isabelle Hupert to play a psychopathic serial killer. Felt very old-school, a movie straight out of the 1980s.*

**Judy - 7/10** - *It's the definition of Oscar bait and is emotionally manipulative, especially towards the end, but it does a great job at humanizing a Hollywood legend.*

**Frozen 2  - 7/10**

**Aladdin - 7/10**

**The Souvenir - 7/10**

**Zombieland 2: Double Tap - 7/10** - *Nowhere near as memorable/iconic as the first one, but it still got a bunch of laughs from me (especially the Thomas Middleditch/Luke Wilson scene). Above-average for a comedy-sequel, but I could see this one not aging well*.

**The Two Popes - 6/10** - *Two solid performances but underwhelming overall, too many cheap-looking flashback scenes, not enough Pryce/Hopkins. Reminded me of Can You Ever Forgive Me? last year, depending on the 2 leads to carry a weak movie/premise on their back, to disappointing results. Highly-overrated movie.*

**Ready Or Not - 6/10**

**Anna - 6/10** - *It's basically Red Sparrow but slightly worse*.

**Saint Frances  - 6/10**

**Hotel Mumbai - 6/10** 

**Shazam! - 6/10** - *Low-stakes, formulaic, superhero movie clearly made with strict budget limitations. It hits all the notes you'd expect a movie like this to hit. It was decent.*

**Alita: Battle Angel - 6/10**

**Loro - 6/10** - *One of the more disappointing movies of the year. On paper it sounds amazing, a sprawling biopic of an infamous/corrupt Italian politician/mogul by Paolo Sorrentino who's not that far removed from a masterpiece? Sign me the fuck up. But nah, this was a shallow, surface-level (like my reviews), pointless dull knife of a biopic. Too much shoehorned religious imagery too. Tone is all over the place. It can't decide whether it's serious or funny and gets lost in-between. It looked nice at least. It also wins this year's ""Most Nudity"" award, easily beating the rest of the field.*

**Teen Spirit - 6/10**

**The Upside - 6/10**

**Gloria Bell - 6/10** - *Great performance from Julianne Moore but this just felt like ""Middle-Aged Crisis: The Movie"". Just couldn't connect to it. I imagine the original is a lot better.*

**On The Basis Of Sex - 6/10**

**Stockholm - 6/10**

**Give Me Liberty  - 6/10**  - *This is an example of a movie that has its heart in the right place but bites off a lot more than it can chew. There's a beautiful, emotional story in here somewhere, but it's too muddled with ineffective editing tricks and too many side-stories. It's sweet in some ways and the true-life characters bring a lot of charm, but it didn't do that much for me. A lot of 'year-end' lists have this as one of the most overlooked movies of the year, but I don't see it. Rough editing, bad soundtrack.*

**Child's Play - 6/10**

**Good Boys - 6/10** - *Just watch Booksmart instead*.

**Styx - 6/10**

**Woman at War - 6/10**

**The Lego Movie 2 -  6/10**

**Missing Link - 6/10**

**Long Shot - 6/10** - *The chemistry between Charlize Theron & Seth Rogen was great but the jokes couldn't really match it. It's a unique mix of politics & humor, but fell short of being an actual crowd-pleaser.*

**Echo in the Canyon - 6/10**

**Cyrano, My Love - 6/10**

**Dora the Explorer - 6/10**

**Brittany Runs A Marathon - 6/10**

**IT: Chapter 2 - 6/10** - *Way too long. Felt like a never-ending series of fetch-quests. Good CGI & acting though.*

**Mister America - 6/10**

**Crawl - 6/10**

**Trial By Fire - 6/10** - *Great performances by Laura Dern & Jack O'Connell get overshadowed by an overly-preacy script. It doesn't let the audience make up its own mind.*

**The Third Wife - 6/10**

**Godzilla: King of Monsters - 5/10** - *This needed less humans, more monsters.*

**Glass - 5/10**

**Escape Room - 5/10**

**Terminator: Dark Fate - 5/10**

**Dumbo - 5/10** 

**All Is True - 5/10**

**Brightburn  - 5/10**

**The White Crow - 5/10** - *One of those biopics where the movie doesn't do justice to the story. Reading the Wikipedia page on this guy's life, you'd except an Oscar contender. Instead it was just okay. Watch Cold War instead. It's basically this movie but better.*

**High Life - 5/10** - *Unpleasant.*

**Where'd You Go Bernadette? - 5/10**

**Scary Stories to Tell Dark - 5/10**

**Her Smell - 5/10** - *This movie made me physically nauseous. The tight, claustrophobic, haze-filled shots in the first 2 acts really threw me off. It's temporarily redeemed by a reallllllly good third act and a solid performance from Elisabeth Moss. But then deflated by a terrible final scene.*

**By the Grace of God - 5/10** - *Based on the critical acclaim, director, and subject matter, I walked in expected to be blown away. Basically expected Spotlight, but this movie completely derails at the halfway point. Hard to sit through*.

**Blinded by the Light - 5/10**

**The Best of Enemies - 5/10**

**The Aeronauts - 5/10** - *This is mis-marketed as an intense survival story but it's really just a boring biopic with too many flashbacks.*

**Fall of the American Empire - 5/10**

**Family - 5/10**

**The Goldfinch - 5/10** - *It turns out an unfilmable novel really is unfilmbable, who would've thought? Shoutout to Jeffrey Wright & Finn Wolfhard for actually trying.*

**Angel Has Fallen - 5/10**

**Gemini Man - 5/10** 

**Late Night  - 5/10**

**Black and Blue  - 5/10** 

**Diane - 5/10** - *This was just depression-porn. Sometimes it works (Mungiu/Zvyagintsev), sometimes it doesn't (this movie). It's such a bummer. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone but Mary Kay Place's performance makes it watchable and engaging sometimes.*

**Destroyer - 5/10**

**How To Train Your Dragon 3 - 5/10**

**Rafiki - 5/10** - *I feel bad for this score because I get that this is a really important/significant movie for African Cinema, but I just couldn't get past the terrible acting, bad (like baaaaaad) dialogue, and lackluster story. Again, pretty big achievement that this got made and reached a global audience, but yeah, in a vacuum, it's undoubtedly a bad movie. Felt like an amateur movie on a shoestring budget.*

**Captive State - 4/10**

**Wild Nights With Emily - 4/10** - *This movie is what happens when someone asks the question ""hey, what if we turned Emily Dickinson's life into an SNL skit?"". I get what they were going for, and Molly Shannon is great, but this was extremely unfunny and probably the longest 84-minute movie I've ever seen.*

**Dark Pheonix - 4/10**

**The Addams Family - 4/10**

**Midway  - 4/10**

**To Dust - 4/10**

**Rojo - 4/10** - *The only memorable thing about this movie is that there was a power outage about 90 minutes in so they comped my ticket and gave me a free drink. So that was cool, I guess.*

**The Kid Who Would Be King - 4/10**

**MIB: International - 4/10**

**The Kid - 4/10** - *There's a 98% chance that this movie is some kind of tax write-off or money laundering scheme. It somehow got 2 big names (Pratt & Hawke), co-starring the son of the producer in his first movie ever. Directed by Vincent D'Onofrio for some reason (???). Was dumped by Lionsgate in a few hundred theaters with 0 marketing/promotion, and flopped hard. It's dated, boring, and unoriginal. Cheesy dialogue. Literally a story that's been told a million times before, usually in much better ways. No reason for this to exist. Chris Pratt has the worst fake-movie-beard of all time in this, that's kinda worth checking out.*

**Ramen Shop - 4/10**

**The Good Liar - 4/10**- *The most convoluted, needlessly-complicated plot of the year. Helen Mirren & Ian McKellen both phone it in (I don't blame them, they were given trash to work with). I hate when movies try to crowbar ""WW2 flashbacks"" into their movies when it's not needed.*

**Climax - 4/10**

**Harriet - 4/10** 

**Lucy in the Sky - 4/10** - *Once or twice a year, a movie comes along that has such a frustrating/stupid/anti-climactic ending it makes me actually angry. This is that movie. Natalie Portman had another movie like that last year (Vox Lux). Hey Noah Hawley, what the fuck?*

**Freaks - 4/10** - *This movie would fit well in the ""Good Idea But Bad Execution"" subreddit.*

**Tel Aviv On Fire - 4/10**

**Ma - 4/10**

**Frankie  -  3/10**

**Stuber - 3/10**

**Serenity - 3/10** - *In a year full of batshit-crazy twists (looking at you, Last Christmas), this easily had the batshit-iest twist. It's something you actually have to experience yourself, and be fully-immersed in it, to appreciate how mind-numblingly crazy it is. How they got A-list talent for this script is a total mystery, but it probably involves of a lot of favors and cocaine. It's almost ""so bad its good"". Almost. I can't wait for the sequel, Free Guy, next year.*

**Maleficent 2: Mistress of Evil - 3/10** - *More genocide than I expected for a live-action Disney fairy tale movie.*

**Donnybrook - 3/10**

**The Photograph - 3/10** - *Zzzzzzzzzz...*

**Charlie's Angels - 3/10**

**Hellboy - 3/10** - *This movie is like that annoying kid in middle school that tries way to hard to be edgy. It's gory and vulgar just for the sake of being gory & vulgar. It reminded me of the Predator reboot last year, had the same kind of dated/forced humor that seems to have no real target audience (except for the aforementioned middle school edgy kid I guess). Bad CGI and a boring villain. iirc it also had a lame sequel-bait ending which I hate.*

**Happy Death Day 2U** - 3/10 - 

**The Sun Is Also A Star** - 3/10 - *It's filmed like a generic music video and has the emotional depth of a puddle.*

**Don't Let Go** - 3/10

**The Invisibles** - 3/10

**Playing with Fire  - 3/10** - *This was just like Mark Wahlberg's Instant Family last year, except that it was worse in every imaginable way. No lie, the end-credits bloopers were by far better than anything else in the movie. It was the only time I even chuckled or felt any type of emotion.*

**Cats - 2/10** - *There's not much more I could say that already hasn't been said. Yes, it was bad. No, it wasn't the worst movie in history. For me, it was just so boring. Forgettable songs (except Beautiful Ghosts), no story/plot, nonsensical ending. Just wanted it to end. Jennifer Hudson just floating into space for no reason, Judi Dench giving me unwarranted lessons about raising cats, Ian McKellen slurping milk from a bowl, Extremely-Hairy-And-Naked-Idris-Elba, Cockroach Genocide, etc. These things all happened and we can't change them, and for us to grow as a society, we need to just move on and learn from our mistakes.*

**Rambo: Last Blood - 2/10**

**The Sound of Silence - 2/10** - *More like The Sound of Boredom, amirite? No but seriously, that's all I got. This movie was the closest I got to falling asleep in my seat this year.*

**Synonyms - 2/10**

**Black Christmas - 2/10** - *Extremely cheesy dialogue, cop-out violence, boring/predictable jump scares, low production value (bad even for a low-end Blumhouse movie), some of the worst one-liners you've ever heard, unrealistic/2D characters. Shitty ending. Wayyyyy too heavy-handed with the message. About as subtle as a flying brick to the forehead. Amateur acting, cutaway for every death, etc etc.*

**After the Wedding - 2/10** - *Overacted, muddled garbage.*

**47 Meters Down Uncaged - 1/10**

**Shaft - 1/10** - *Crude, unfunny, soulless, grating, pointless. There's a million adjectives I could use to describe this reboot, and none of them are positive. This is one I'm surprised I didn't just walk out of. Probably didn't have anything better do do that day.*

**Jexi - 1/10** - *This year's worst movie. It's just the kind of movie that leaves a bad taste in your mouth, like you need to watch something else to get the stink of this one out of your mind. It was just so mean-spirited, from start to finish. Not a single joke landed, you just hated all of the characters. There are no redeeming factors. On the technical side, it was very basic, looked like a cheap music video. No memorable scenes, no good lines of dialogue, no originality in any way. None of the ""cheerful""/""pick-me-up"" moments earn any kind of emotional reaction. If you had a freshman high-school film student remake Her as a shitty comedy, this would be it. The fact that I paid money to see this is something I will never live down.*

**Other:**

* The longest stretch I went without going to the movies was from July 21st thru August 20th, without a single trip to the movies. Partially due to an out-of-country trip and personal stuff. During this time I ""missed out"" on **The Kitchen**, **The Nightingale**, **Brian Banks**, and **Honeyland**. Mostly caught up to the rest.
* The most theater visits in a one-week span was November 1st thru November 8th, with 8 movies that week.
* The most in one day was 3 movies in theaters on March 15th, 2019 (**Styx**, **To Dust**, and **Captive State**).
* There were 26 double-headers this year (two movies in theaters during the same day, usually back-to-back).

Solid year, not as many surprises as 2018 though. Going to try to break 200 in 2020.

"Today, we killed our company :)","I dedicate this to the antiwork community. 1 small victory at a time. United we are strong!

They don't know it yet, but me and my buddy just got hired on with a different company. Without us, they literally don't have a business going. Not an exaggeration. They haven't had anyone apply to job openings, and work staff has declined from 12 to 3 of us. Only 3 of us, doing the work of 12, for years now.

For months we've asked for raises after years of stagnant wages, working through the pandemic, expecting us to wrap our lives around work. Always met with excuses about It's not in the budget.

We're putting in our 2 weeks notice days apart from each other. When I put in mine, all of a sudden, money magically appeared in the budget to keep us. This pissed my boss off, because he really believed they didn't have the money. Told them, if we both leave, he's leaving too! My boss has never lied to me in 8 years of knowing him.

So come Monday, they have less than 2 weeks to figure out how to hire a new staff, get everyone up to speed including training, and pray there are no major hiccups, all while the holidays are approaching.

Only reason I'm staying my full 2 weeks, I want to see it go down :) see what carrots they'll try to dangle to keep us, and the looks on their faces as I repeatedly decline each offer.

All inspired from this community. Thank you for sharing your struggles. Letting me know I'm not alone.

Edit:
Wow! Totally wasn't expecting this go anywhere. I usually am the commenting, never posting. Thank you all for your support, shared struggles, and taking the time to read.

Yes, I am a real person, and this isn't a throw away account. Everything is absolutely true, and only posted after knowing my buddy was secure in his position of leaving.
I purposefully left out key things like company name, State it's in, or other easily identifying info because it's the internet. While many support aspects antiwork, we may not all support it in the same way. 
Even notified that this post was reported to the Reddit crisis center.

To those leaving negative even hateful comments, why? Have your tactics to improve your working conditions actually worked? Just because I took a different course of action than you would have, I'm in the wrong?
Please stop the pissing contest. While each industry, and job has unique challenges. Deplorable working conditions, are NOT a contest or a badge of honor. 

If anything, this should be renamed to: After years of Piss poor management, and financial choices, employees give notice; Leaving company to wonder why employees would do this to them.

Edit 2- 
12/22/2021 

My friends of antiwork, I haven't forgotten about you. Trust there is an update to this. This week has been an absolute wild ride that I hope all of you get to enjoy at some point in your lives. 

Some have messaged privately saying I should take cation. That my actions/words may influence you to do the same without thinking. So please be cautious. Don't just quit, but plan quitting in such a way you never need to return. All companies aren't so weak as to topple from a single person leaving. Mine Just happen to be :)
You all are amazing. Together we are strong!

Edit 3: 
I really did start working here with hope. I wanted this place to work. 
To everyone saying, wHat AbOut nEediNg RefErenCes. How disconnected are you from reality to think you've been talking to other supervisors this whole time? A crack head with a phone number gives a better reference. Don't break your arms jerking each other off so hard thinking arbitrary references are a reason people need to stay with a Shit company.
Also, billion dollar companies don't do everything in house. They hire companies like the one I worked for to feed them. For example, Lamazon previously used the USPS, they in turn hired contractors to ship packages to other facilities. It's all a big game of taking a percentage, while sub contracting the work. You never notice because the products you buy have the same store label you bought from. Never mind, the supply chain it took to get there.

Edit 3 cont- The Fallout
First day. 
Pretty mundane. No direct contact with owners. Was told from my boss they asked if I could be bought. If they matched pay, would that be good.
Declined the offer. Said I can't be bought into staying. I'm working my 2 weeks and not a day more. Don't really care about holiday bonuses. Keep them.

Second day.
Buddy is offered 3 bucks more over what new place is paying, plus a hundred bucks each time he needs to travel. Not per diem, think of it as a travel bonus, but each time a trip is made. Oh, and can he also stay around to train the replacements.
The replacements who also aren't certified, and fresh from school. They wanted him to pass up a much better opportunity, because the only people they could fine to accept the job offer are fresh from school. Needless to say, he declined.
My boss decides to feel bad and decided the ball is in his court. What about the past few years where if we go, you go?
Well, I wanted to, I really did, but at my age where am I going to find a better offer? I'm only a few years from getting social security. After I get heath insurance, I won't need to work anymore. What's a few more years.
(Proceed to fill him in on how much health insurance has changed in the past decade lol)

Third day
By this time news has spread to the rest of the company. The accountant, decided he'll just go back to being retired. Doesn't need to deal with this headache. Office manger decides, he can do this job remotely. If they won't offer remote, he'll fine another job. 
Then the pilots got wind of everything.
Holy Shit, this is when things got amazing! A normally reserved, well mannered person of a pilot wrote the most scathing email I've ever read. Years of frustration came pouring out. The resentment of missing out on family events, long hours, always talking about issues but never actually doing anything to fix them came out. 
He didn't quit outright, but omg.

Day four (today)
Started the day with an email from the boss. He decided to turn in his resignation. He found a job that pays the same for 3 days of set work, vs the current 5 days and being on call 24/7. 
I'm selling my house boys.
He gave it a lot of thought. He doesn't like anything lol. His neighborhood has changed so much, the job isn't a place he wants to stay. He decided at some point next year, he's selling his house. He's going to pursue a life on the water. I've never heard him so happy. Let me rephrase. The man has never been happy, but when he spoke, it had this calm over tone to it. Wouldn't fill me in on what the new job was, but he wants to be closer to the water, and enjoy working around the docks like he did when he was in highschool.

Now I get a call from the owners. Ignored!
(If you've never ignored a call from a person in a position of power, you really need to try it :) )
Give a call back about an hour later. 
What's is going to take to keep you? Is there anything we can do?

My friends at antiwork, this! I finally had the ear and undivided attention of the owner!

But an odd thing happened. I didn't hate the guy. As much as I wanted to rub his face in it. Just unload how much I've hated it here. I realized with that phone call, there wasn't a winner. Just a person investing his time into a business that was crumbling before him. Me, an employee just tired of trying.

No man, there's nothing you can do. I'm just moving on to a better opportunity. I don't hate you guys, this is something I need to do.

Then in that same moment, compassion at all time highs, they ask if I can stay on for a few months to train the replacements.
(Did you hear anything, absolutely anything I just said??)
Nope! Not training anyone, once I leave that's it. There's no way I'm traveling that much. Best of luck.
-click
Then left work. It was a nice day out today, I'm not spending it looking for busy work.

So that's that my friends. A bit anti climactic, but that's usually how things go.
The start date for the new job got pushed back till February. So I have roughly 6 whole weeks to just enjoy life. 
Apologizes for not being a better writer if reading seems a bit choppy. These are the highlights :)

Best of luck with all your endeavors antiwork.

"A crime was committed yesterday during the Saturday Skirmish. iDropz_bodies cheated his way to $130,000. Epic, do not be foolish. This is burglary. There must be a FULL-ON investigation on his matches played.","**Edit:** 

https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/90q2bn/summer_skirmish_week_2_friday_winner/?st=JJVL3H5V&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;sh=ec14de5c

**Epic was able to conclude a quick investigation and determined no foul play (link above).**

**I would also like to confirm that EPIC did reach out to me and assured that they cross-checked PS4 Machine IDs with IP Addresses, and concluded that every player eliminated by iDropz_Bodies was indeed UNIQUE.**

Although I had sincere doubts this would be the case, it is somewhat refreshing to see. 

At the end of the day there’s no reason to believe Epic would be dishonest about this. 

I do want to take time to thank Epic for helping insure the integrity of these matches. 

Although according to the investigation, a lot of us were indeed wrong, especially me. I have no doubt that the backlash and the quick and thorough investigation into cheating by Epic games will work as a deterrent for future players whom may have once considered it. 

At this point, all we can ever do as human beings is own up to a mistake, and give our sincerest apologies and congratulations to @idropz_bodies. 

An even bigger apology from me, @idropz_bodies. I was the one who started this post, and although I only wanted to start an investigation, I know how these things can quickly turn into something more bitter. So for that, I apologize.

**LAST EDIT:** 

Guys, I trust Epics response and investigation..

Still getting a crazy amount of PMs from people who were in iBodiez stream and could swear Epic is trying to cover it up. Unfortunately, we would have no way to prove this, and if Epic says they backtracked IPs with PS4 machine IDs, the best outcome this could possibly turn into is a he said, she said. 

Regardless, I feel responsible for showcasing what a huge number of people still feel and are urging me to help exemplify, which is doubt, and suspicion beyond reasonable doubt. I feel this comment exemplifies the types of PMs I’m getting best:

https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/90ouq3/comment/e2s88o5?st=JJW4DOUN&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;sh=9b6a7512
 
Also getting a lot of people who want the VODs of winners to be automatically released to the public. This is actually a very very popular request. I’d feel guilty ignoring it. 

Should Epic release the VODs of the winner in every tournament? 

Of course they *should*, they own the rights, and they can put it on the front page of their very game like they did right after their other Tournament they held in Los Angeles. 

Hell, they should release the VODs of the Top 3 players for entertainment reasons unrelated to being some sort of cheat-filter. I want to see these players go off when it matters most. I’m sure many would love to watch these guys’ 10 Matches of them slaying out, as well. Don’t see much wrong with the idea. If not for this tournament, then for future ones. If it kills two birds with one stone, awesome. 

This post has blown up to become a life of its own. You hear the evidence from both sides of the aisle. I’ll let everyone believe whatever they’d like to believe. As for me, I’m choosing the hopeful optimistic approach, because simply, I’d hate to believe otherwise.

I hope regardless of outcome, this shows the potential flaw in allowing competitive matches to just become *who kills the most random players in a public lobby*. Of course, if you’re going to put players in the same lobby and make them compete against each other, you’d have to separate PS4 from PC due to the inherent advantages of KB+M. Nickmercs might kill more noobs than Ninja and Tfue, because a major part of the public lobby tournament format is your luck into how many noobs you run into. However, if you actually put Nick, or any console player for that matter, in a 1v1 vs any PC pro player who’s sweating for money, there’s very minimal chance the console player can actually pull off the win. 

So there are Pros and Cons with each format. Public lobby format has problems with uncertainty/loopholes. Private lobby format with all players in the same lobby has other problems because to be fair, you’d have to separate the platforms in order to offer a competitive balance. Hopefully there’s a middle ground Epic can figure out. 

My personal take is separating console eSports from PC eSports.  There’s a reason every game across multiple platforms does it. By separating the platforms, you can throw everybody in the same lobby, and have them battle it out. It shouldn’t be that hard, and the money (100,000,000) is definitely there to do it.

This was really my last edit guys. Thank you for all the PMs and generosity in general, but I feel like I did enough to showcase both sides of this dilemma and their wants/voices. I addressed people’s format issue, among many other questionable concerns, such as the huge concern of Epics stance of allowing KB+M on console, in which I’m confident after a little more feedback, they’ll definitely revert. I also echoed what Epic claimed as truth in their own separate post, because unfortunately my post blew up to r/all, among other subreddits, and I didn’t want one post to get any less recognition than the other. 

You guys are amazingly passionate. Regardless of the hate mail, I think this community is pretty awesome. 

See you on the battlefield, I’m landing Viking Village. 

**Beginning of OG Post**

IDropz_bodies is a PS4 player who won yesterday’s Saturday Skirmish. I was happy to see a fellow PS4 player did well, but unfortunately after seeing the evidence, it’s almost inevitable there was collusion and corruption in his win and road to winning $130,000.

**First, his stats:** 

iDropz_bodies had a 4 KD in Season 4. Before the tournament, he had a 4.5 in Season 5. It was elevated to 7+ after securing a 45 KD in Tournament matches. That is a 1000% increase as soon as the tournament started, and a quick drop back down to his normal self once the tournament was over. He dropped two 20+ kill wins in back to back matches, along with multiple matches between the 12-19 kill range. If you look at his past matches in Season 5, he has never done anything ever close to that.

**Suspect Replays:** 

After being accused of not being the one playing his matches (having his account recovered by someone else), he quickly shut down those rumors by streaming his replays on his Twitch channel. By doing this, he didn’t know the biggest suspicion of all was about to unfold. 

During the streaming of his replays. Viewers noticed there was countless players who did not shoot at him at all. Instead, these players just ran up to him and although moved around, didn’t really attempt to shoot him at all. There were even instances where players stayed in 1x1s within 5 yards of each other, yet didn’t shoot at one-another. Instead, both waited for iDropz_bodies to easily build up, and without even breaking a sweat, kill the players. There was also instances where iDrop jump padded right to where multiple no-shooting-back players were, as if he knew their location precisely. This apparently happened multiple times.

When some viewers backtracked some names of the “easy” kills iDrop got. They found out something very worrying. These players accounts were brand new, and their first games just so happened to be during iDropz tournament matches. 

Viewers of the stream accounted for as high as 10 of these ultra no shooting back players during both of iDropz 20+ kill games.

But what was most suspicious of all about these players.. was what was in their inventory. When iDropz killed them, they did not have any shield he was burning through when shooting (they were 100 health 0 shield). However, in their inventory, they had minis, half pots, med kits etc. 

For those who are not aware, it’s easier than you think to hop into someone’s match. The suspicion is that iDrop had players Queue up the same time as him and give him free kills so he can place higher in the tournament. This is something that has happened before in the past, and still does happen in tourneys run by CMG/GB. It has happened in the past, and for a lot less money.

**Deleted “Suspended?” Twitch Account:**

Right after viewers switched their accusations from him not playing the matches to him having guys create new accounts and give him kills, something strange happened. People started sharing his Twitch because the proof was supposedly blatant and consistent through his matches. As people became increasingly aware, all of a sudden his Twitch channel was deleted, and with that, all the VODs of the blatant cheating. 

He claims that Twitch “suspended” his channel because of a profanity he used during one of his vods from when he use to play Destiny. Could be true, of course, yet very coincidental and beneficial that nobody can see those VODs anymore.

**Irregular leaving of Matches:**

iDrop was said to have left a lot of matches before the bus began dropping players, so that the match wouldn’t count towards his score in the tournament. He claimed through his stream he only left the matches because he “did not like the drop.” However, this left many to speculate after seeing the type of players he did run into when choosing to stay in a game, that he may have left those past matches in the scenarios where multiple friends didn’t get in. Constantly leaving matches because “not liking the drop” was NOT something we saw a lot of from other streamers. Some claim they think Nickmercs did it a couple times, but that’s not confirmed. I will say that I watched Nickmercs stream, and did not personally see it happen. 

**Invited because of LTM win:** 

He was invited because he won an an LTM mode sometime back in the past. I believe it was the Showdown mode. This mode has been scrutinized, because many believed at that time that people cheated, and coincidentally, had friends join their lobbies and give them free kills.

**Epic:** Cause for suspicion is true and undeniable. There is only one thing to do. There must be a full-on investigation into this players matches. I recommend looking at the replays and seeing if there really is an influx of players who did not shoot back. 

Also, I’d look at the IP address of players he routinely has played with before the tourney, and the IP of the players who looked like free kills in his tournament matches, and see if any of those IPs match up.

Of course it can be hard to prove corruption if you hide your footsteps. But there are mistakes and precautions that not everyone takes. When this much money is on the line, and there is this much cause for concern, due diligence and investigating is necessary on Epics part. It will preserve the integrity of future matches, and if there is no doubt that this player cheated, legal action should be apart of it. 

$130,000 is nothing to joke about. 

If nothing comes of it, I’m sure many of us will have our suspicious, but we will gladly take the fact that Epic looked into something that begged itself to be looked at. 

**TLDR:** Huge red flags with yesterday’s Saturday Skirmish and $130,000 take home winner. Investigation is necessary from Epic. If proven true, this player is robbing Epic and other competitors in the Tournament. 

**EDIT:** Wow, Reddit Gold! Thank you so much! Don’t even know what it is or how to use it, but I know it confirms what I believe. This post is IMPORTANT. 

**EDIT:** Oh my, second Gold! Wish I knew what it did, nonetheless, I’m happy you guys share my concern. Thank you to everyone, thank you to the person who Golded me, and lastly thank you to the moderators for facilitating this discussion and help bring awareness to a very suspicious situation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/90ouq3/a_crime_was_committed_yesterday_during_the/,Sora26,2018-07-21 17:10:34,41295,FortNiteBR

"Open Letter to Steve Huffman and the Board of Directors of Reddit, Inc– If you believe in standing up to hate and supporting black lives, you need to act","**Open Letter to Steve Huffman and the Board of Directors of Reddit, Inc – If you believe in standing up to hate and supporting black lives, you need to act**

Dear Steve,

On June 1, you shared a letter on Reddit’s blog  [“Remember the Human – Black Lives Matter”]( https://redditblog.com/2020/06/01/remember-the-human-black-lives-matter/).  In this letter, you claim “as Snoos, we do not tolerate hate, racism, and violence, and while we have work to do to fight these on our platform, our values are clear.”

As of today, neither you nor any other Reddit admins have shared this letter anywhere on reddit.com. However, [the response to this message was swift on Twitter](https://twitter.com/reddit/status/1267643352851247106), where you were rightfully labeled as hypocritical based on your long and well-recorded history of defending racism and white supremacy on this site. 

Among the many responses was this message from former CEO of Reddit, Ellen Pao. 

>[I am obligated to call you out: You should have shut down the_donald instead of amplifying it and its hate, racism, and violence. So much of what is happening now lies at your feet. You don't get to say BLM when reddit nurtures and monetizes white supremacy and hate all day long](https://twitter.com/ekp/status/1267689503797342208)

Many others shared links and screenshots of your past statements saying [“Open racism and slurs are fine to post on Reddit”](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/12/racism-slurs-reddit-post-ceo-steve-huffman).

The problem of Reddit’s leadership supporting and providing a platform for racist users and hateful communities has long been an issue.  Nearly six years ago, [dozens of subreddits signed the original open letter to the Reddit admins](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/2ejg1b/we_have_a_racist_user_problem_and_reddit_wont/) calling for action.  While [the Reddit admins acknowledged the letter](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/2m9k6p/maybe_its_time_to_repost_the_open_letter_reddit/cm27j8j/) and said it was a high priority to address this issue, extremely little has been done in the intervening years.

On June 5, you shared this update on /r/Announcements, [Upcoming changes to our content policy, our board, and where we’re going from here](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/).  In the post, you stated that there is a need for continued adjustments of Reddit’s content policy to address racism and that this remains a priority.  These continued statements that you hear us, that this is a priority, or that you are working on it are not enough.  It has been five years since your return as CEO and this still remains Reddit’s most glaring problem.

Steve, if you and Reddit genuinely care about the values of standing up to racism and hate, then you need to back it up with real action.  As moderators on this website who have dedicated countless hours to keeping this site running, we call on Reddit to take the following steps:

* **Enact a sitewide policy against racism, slurs, and hatespeech targeted at protected groups.** For too many years, Steve Huffman and the other Admins have stood by and allowed this site to fester with hate in the name of “free speech.”  It is time to enact a specific and detailed policy that protects the disadvantaged members of our communities from hate based on their sexuality, gender identity, ethnicity, country of origin, religion, or disability.

* **Be proactive in banning hate-based communities**  In the past Reddit has only taken action on hate subreddits when they were featured in the news and risked Reddit’s reputation or when they were documented and featured on /r/AgainstHateSubreddits and other forums.  AHS should not have to be responsible for raising awareness of hate subreddits and reporting them to the admins.  This site should take responsibility for keeping its users safe by banning any remaining subreddits devoted to hate and racism and preventing the creation of hateful subreddits in the future. 

* **Be proactive in banning hate users** Reddit needs to not only ban hate subreddits, but must be proactive in banning the moderators of these subreddits and their most active users.  Too often these users have been allowed to stay on this website after numerous sitewide violations, letting them move on to participate in new hate communities and spread their vitriol further across this site.

* **Reddit needs to hire more minorities / women, especially in leadership roles** Reddit needs to hire more women and people of color — particularly in leadership roles in the company — to help shift the corporate culture and policies to be more equitable for all.  In addition, Reddit needs to take adequate steps to protect these employees from harassment. 

* **Reddit needs to hire more community managers** According to Reddit's [job listings](https://www.redditinc.com/careers) there are dozens of open positions that the company is hiring for, and yet not a single one for Community.  Reddit has enacted numerous policies over the years that have been detrimental to the ability of Reddit’s moderators or the broader Reddit community.  Reddit needs more community managers to build positive relations and engagement with the site’s volunteer moderators.

* **Honor Alexis Ohanian's wishes to have his Reddit Board seat filled with a black candidate** - On June 5, Reddit Co-Founder and Executive Chairman [announced that he would be stepping down](https://twitter.com/alexisohanian/status/1268943036228292608) from his role on Reddit's Board of Directors.  Alexis requested that his position be filled with a black candidate and we ask Reddit to honor that request.  While you have stated your intent to honor that request, we are asking for an announcement to be made on this decision in the next 3 months.  We believe this is not an issue that should be put off for action years down the road.

At /r/AgainstHateSubreddits, we have laid out the many failures of Steve time and again to stand up to white supremacy on this site [time]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/gv7mtn/steve_spez_huffman_is_finally_claiming_that_black/) and [time]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/a3q6ck/2018_reddit_review_a_year_of_hate_propaganda_and/) and [time]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/84q74p/bbc_calls_out_rthe_donald_for_being_a_thriving/) again.

With a website with the impact of Reddit on the broader conversations being held in communities around the world, this website needs real leadership and real action.

We hope that Reddit will not just share empty platitudes — but will take a meaningful stand against hate, and take these recommendations to heart.

"I am the accidental IT guy + anti-poaching pilot in the Central African Bush that got pissed at Microsoft for their Windows 10 shenanigans. I'm here with the project's staff, deep in the Chinko Reserve. Some folks asked.. so here we are.. AUA","###Thanks everyone. Gotta call it a night (Generators are off and bugs keep flinging themselves at my screen at a high velocity). Hope some of you found this an interesting glimpse into our isolated life here. And thanks to everyone who donated.. every little bit counts and we've been blown away by the generosity! (Btw, Total Win X usage here... 17gb!)

   
*^Edit:* ^Just ^a ^mass ^edit ^notice. ^This ^morning, ^now ^that ^my ^brain ^isn't ^fried.. ^I've ^gone ^thru ^a ^bunch ^of ^my ^comments ^to ^edit ^for ^spelling/grammar ^and ^also ^to ^add ^some ^information ^if ^I ^didn't ^fully ^answer
***
   
So.. I'm the guy that **[ranted about Windows 10 updates secretly downloading](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/4mcdon/i_live_in_the_central_african_bush_we_pay_for/)** on our slow, expensive, satellite connection. I was just upset, and venting. However, since there were several requests for an AMA, and we are trying to fundraise after our ultralight airplane crashed (album below), we decided it could be cool to try.   
   
To be honest, I have a good deal of experience as a bush pilot & IT guy in East Africa, as well as living in Antarctica and many other cool places.. but the staff here can speak with more experience about Anti-Poaching/wildlife protection and the creation of this project. So, if you guys are interested in this..  I'll do the typing, and they'll field your questions.   
   
***   
   
***About Us***:    
We are a team of local Central African + foreign expat staff in the Chinko Reserve (bordering Congo & South Sudan) trying to save wildlife from the militarized rebel poachers. We train and deploy rangers to hunt down these smugglers who have killed the majority of game wildlife and attack the local villages. Using aircraft, we support the rangers from above. Though, with the recent accident, along with the constant threat of armed poachers and rebel groups like Kony's LRA child army.. we are up against it!!   
   
Our founder first conceived the project in 2012 while he was falsely imprisoned for a massacre he discovered and tried to report! (Link below) In the last 30 years, poaching has driven the elephant population from 60,000 down to only a couple 100! However, In a very short time, Chinko has cleared a 3,000 sq/km ""core protection zone"" of all activity, & wildlife have seen significant rises. Now, we are trying to expand further into the reserve, which at 17,600 sq/km is almost as big as Kruger national park, and virtually untouched!  
   
   
***Fundraising***  
With the loss of our ULM, we started this campaign in the hopes to quickly get our operation back up to 100% . The few expats here have spent the majority of the last years in the bush & never tried a crowdfunding medium. I, while NOT a professional PR guy for this organization, have been an avid redditor for years. So I convinced the boss that this could be a possible venue for fundraising if people are interested. (Included proof below).  
   
If you *are* interested, check out our campaign here: **[Indiegogo's Generosity Site](https://igg.me/at/y2mhLo7F5RY)**.     
... We're even giving bitcoin a try!  **14bNP5krJeBPGT6xYWdfQYD4veNC9nLiib** ..

AITA for telling my sister that she should have gone to college if she wanted a life like mine?,"Hello everyone, please excuse my grammar. English is my 4th language and 100% self taught. Also this will be a long post. 

My sister and I are twins (33F). We come from a culture where arranged marriages are an option (not India). Mostly they are blind dates set by a matchmaker. And if you are compatible you marry. 

When we both graduated highschool, my sister (who was valedictorian BTW) chose not to attend college. She asked for an arranged marriage since all she wanted to be was a wife and mother (nothing wrong with that). My parents (who are a love match) tried to convince her to at least get her bachelor's. She refused. I on the other hand started attending an engineering college (computer engineering) 

A year later she married a man that she met through the matchmaker. He is a very nice man, a teacher and treats my sister like a queen. The thing is he was just a freshly hired teacher. My sister went from living in a double income house with parents being both high earners (a doctor and a lawyer) to a single income house on a teacher's salary. 

I graduated at 23, started working as a cyber security personnel for a big bank. After 2 years of dating around, I too asked for an arranged marriage. 

My husband is a business owner (real estate developer) and he makes a lot more than I do. He also comes from money. 

My sister didn't like him from the get go, she even threw a tantrum (thankfully in private) in my wedding. Apparently the bride gifts he brought were tacky (more like very expensive, more than what yer husband could get her) 

The problem is that my first child is now at the age where she will be starting pre-school, we signed her for a private school. The monthly tuition is more than what her husband makes. 

When she heard this she just exploded. She was ranting about how it's not fair that our kids will not have equal opportunities, how the only reason I could live like I do was that my parents chose a better husband for me. 

I became angry, for how she treats me, how unfair she was to her husband and my parents, so I laid the truth on her, I told her I got matched with a better husband because I am a college educated woman with a respectable job, and that wealthy men using matchmakers don't want 19 years old highschool graduates, their standards are higher. I told her that her husband is a wonderful man who loves her, but if all she wanted was wealthy man she should have gone to college. 

Now she is NC with me, she says that I am an elitist AH. 

So AITA?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/v2so1r/aita_for_telling_my_sister_that_she_should_have/,Fickle_Spinach_3415,2022-06-02 02:58:39,22017,AmItheAsshole
"TIFU by probably ruining a girl's life, forever, via Capture the Flag.","Today I fucked up. There's a girl in my Ecology class. Let's call her ""Madge"". Madge is your go-getting try-hard holier-than-thou know-it-all with an unchanging facial expression I can only describe as ""cat trying to shit a peach pit"". One of those constant-frowners, and constant-downers. 

I even tried to get along with Madge at the start; I'd sit by her and try to engage her (read: humor her) with conversations in relevant topics about Ecology, such as the thrilling handedness of apes or edge-of-your-seat songbird plumage complexity, but just trying to be civil was a futile endeavour. Expecting Madge to be civil with you because you were civil with her is like expecting the lion not to eat you because you didn't eat it. Madge was born to be an asshole.

Everything you said to her was met with a ""Pffft"", or a dramatic roll of the eyes, and a quick retort such as ""Well, if you'd actually *read* Carter et al. 2007, you would have known that..."" She had to be better and smarter than everyone, at everything, all the time. And boy, that shit got real old, real quick. So I stopped sitting by her. And began to loathe her. With a pre-occupied disposition. I thought about her twice today before even writing this, that's how much I don't like her.

Fast forward to the first Capture the Flag game of the year. Being a Freshman, I thought I'd attend as a way to get out of my residence room and meet some people. The first game was at about 8:00PM, the campus was already dark, and I showed up just wearing shorts and a T-shirt. Out of 150+ people (who knew Capture the Flag was so popular?) I ended up being possibly the most under-dressed person there. Camouflage, Ghillie suits, face-paint, and black morph costumes were just some of the norm. This was like Capture the Flag Olympics. 

Teams were divided into short sleeve vs. long sleeve, and the ""flags"" were two bicycle lights. I began to mingle with fellow short-sleeves... and that's when I saw her. Madge. Black boots, black pants, black turtleneck, black scarf, black cap, black gloves. She was going all Call of Duty for this game -- of course. Why wouldn't she be a try-hard at Capture the Flag too? And I just knew I'd have to tag her the fuck out. This was my chance to prove I was better at something.

The first few rounds, us short-sleeves did terribly because no one stayed behind to defend, so we lost 3 rounds promptly. Each time they blew the whistle, I could hear Madge laughing. I could hear it. So I switched to defense. To prevent ""camping"", there was a 50 meter buffer around each ""flag"". Conveniently for me, there was a group of hedges 50 meters away from my flag. So I hid in the hedges.

Each time anyone from the other team tried to sneak up to our flag, I'd jump out of the hedges, startle the hell out of them, and that would give me the time I needed to run up and tag them out. I'd probably tagged out 8-10 people in about 15 minutes, when the stars aligned, and I saw her. Madge. Walking through the shadows along the side of a building, headed straight for our flag, thinking she was so sneaky with all her matching black gear. This was it. It was *my time to shine*.

But I was too excitable. I bounded from the hedges like Sea Biscuit while she was still a good 40-50 feet away. So I yelled ""AAAaarrgh!"" to try to emphasize the startling effect. She shrieked in surprise, but without missing a beat, she spun around 180 degrees and headed back for her ""side"" at a dead sprint. I then realized that if she got to her side before I caught her, she'd be ""out of play"" and I couldn't tag her out -- that was an impossible embarrassment, I couldn't allow it. I took off too, at a dead sprint. Like Gimli, I'm not so much for long runs, but dangerous across short distances. I was gaining on her, and now confidently puffed up, with a laugh I shouted ""YOU CAN RUN IF YOU WANT, I'LL JUST CATCH YOU WHEN YOU'RE TIRED!""

The chase lasted probably 100-150 feet before she tripped on a tree root and fell pretty hard, but made no attempt to get back up. As I got closer, I realized she had stooped to a whole new low - playing the crying game, surely exaggerating an injury that would thus make my ""tagging"" of her distasteful. But then as I got closer still, I realized she was *really* crying, like *hysterically* crying. I was still mad, so as I got up to her I said ""Crying won't fucking help"", at which point she rolled on to her back and looked up at me and shouted ""GET THE FUCK AWAY!"". I leaned down to make eye contact and said ""it's just a fucking game"", to which she cocked an eyebrow and said ""WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?!""

And then it hit me.

I did not recognize this girl.

*This was not Madge.*

This was some girl walking to the bus station after a night class.

Horrified, mouth hanging open, the rolodex of my mind spun as I suddenly imagined what it must have been like from her perspective: a large, strange, bearded, sweaty, under-dressed man jumped out of the bushes screaming ""AAARRRRrrrgh!"", and when she ran, he ran too, screaming ""YOU CAN RUN IF YOU WANT, I'LL JUST CATCH YOU WHEN YOU'RE TIRED"", and when he saw her crying, said ""Crying won't fucking help"".

I wanted to apologize, I wanted to introduce myself, I wanted to explain, but all I could get out was ""Hey... sorry -- it was, it's just... Hi, I'm... Hey, you know, Capture the Flag?... PLEASE DON'T CALL THE POLICE, THIS WAS ALL A MISUNDERSTANDING"" and then I ran away hoping she hadn't seen enough of my face to create a composite sketch for Campus Security.

I never ended up tagging her, or Madge for that matter, and I never went back to Capture the Flag after that (I hear it may be getting cancelled) but I probably caused some seriously deep-seated anxieties about night classes that will haunt that poor girl forever.

Dear night class girl, if you're a Redditor, I am so sorry. I'm actually a pretty nice guy, really.

TL;DR - Today I fucked up by wanting to get back at a snooty know-it-all from Ecology class by chasing her down at a night game of Capture The Flag only to realize I'd chased down (and probably subsequently scarred) some girl from night class who wasn't even playing.

**EDIT:** Wow, thanks for the Reddit gold, guys - I'd say ""you surprised me and popped my gold cherry"" but that expression would seem to be in poor taste after my story. 

**EDIT:** I never realized how much I made it sound like she broke her neck at first. Holy shit. Also, I laughed my ass off at how many people say there's sexual tension between me and Madge. Fucking Madge.      ... But maybe there is tension. Maybe I am in love with her... holy shit MY WHOLE LIFE HAS BEEN A LIE! Jk lol I really still hate her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2txjm0/tifu_by_probably_ruining_a_girls_life_forever_via/,TheTrueMountainMan,2015-01-28 10:04:12,22008,tifu

AITA for forcing my husband to pay for my daughter's piano after he damaged it?,"My husband & I have been together for 2 an a half years. I have a daughter ""Callie"", she's 13, she loves instrumental music and piano has been her #1 interest. I'm not saying this because she's my daughter but really, I see her talent as special and more importantly...she uses it to express her feelings especially for her deceased father who passed away when she was 7. She always says that she, in a way connects to him through playing piano. So I encouraged her to do more and her grandparents bought her a 6000 thousand piano that she was so thrilled with.

The whole family encourages her but my husband thinks she's being distracted from school, real future etc. He doesn't attend her plays, doesn't help with the academy, doesn't even take the time to listen to her playing and everytime he comes home and hears her playing upstairs, he'd lecture us about how this activity is just a waste of time. I sat him down and told him about Callie picking up on that bad vibe, he got mad and said that he was doing my job for me and ensuring she doesn't get distracted from school although her grades are good.

We went back an forth on this and I made it clear that this should stop. He said okay and that was the end of it.

On Sunday a huge argument ensued in the house because my husband claimed Callie woke him up on his day off with her loud playing. He issued an ultimatuim, either the piano goes or he gets rid of it himself. I asked where should I take it? He said Callie's grandparents house but Callie didn't want to. After we left I found out that my husband took it to the junk yard his dad works at and cut it into pieces. A big argument ensued and we literally had a screaming match infront of his family over this. I gave him 2 days to pay for a new one despite him apologizing and saying he acted in a moment of desperation and frustration. He said the only way he could pay for it is using his savings that was supposed to go towards his new Garage as a side business. He complained about me forcing him to pay and ruining his business before it even starts. 


He kept sending his family as middle-men to get me to give him at least 4 months but I refused and stood my ground despite being called unreasonable since it's a piano vs new business. 


AITA for forcing him to pay and not giving him time?

EDIT ~~ No, he didn't have an issue with whatever Callie was doing at first til we started living together. At first I thought that as a family we tend to get annoyed by stuff other family members do but apparently...this is not the case. By the way tonight or tomorrow morning is the timeline I've given him and so far I haven't heard from him or his dad.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/vmn00z/aita_for_forcing_my_husband_to_pay_for_my/,SUDDEN-IMPACT-3097,2022-06-28 18:12:57,21640,AmItheAsshole

**MATCH EVENTS:**

**0'** Harry is only 6th in line for the throne so this one does not have the same buzz as William's Wedding who's definitely going to be the future King but the people are thrilled nevertheless.  

**0'** The Rolls-Royce Phantom IV is polished and should appear soon.

**0'** We just saw Sir Elton John on the bench. Hard to tell how bummed he is to be not on the pitch right now.

**1'** The Music has started. Shit's about to get real. 

**1'** We see Harry coming on now accompanied by William. Both looking sharp af.

**5'** And There is the car with the opponent and her mum. It's getting heated.

**20'** Only disappointment so far is the performance of William's hairline. 

**25'** Here we have Charles trying to step out of Elizabeth's shadow with a slide tackle just before she's entering the scene.

**30'** One could argue that GB's defense line is looking a bit too harmless today, like little girls with flowers.

**31'** Quite remarkable display of stamina by Prince Philip, he hasn't fallen asleep yet although he's already 5 minutes in the game. That's amazing considering he's 428 years old!

**33'** Markle looking great in the new home kit. You can get it in the team store now for a discount of just £100,000!

**40'** Harry and Meghan have a long talk with the official right now, I feel like they might get carded. Difficult situation for both of them since the match is likely getting more physical later on.

**42'** Prince George holding back the urge to speak out against Harry marrying a pleb.

**45'** ⚽ **Goooal! In a freaky turn of events Markle and Harry both beautifully score within seconds! Harry confidently declares ""I will"" and so does she. The new score is 1-1.**

**56'** Passionate solo by Reverend Curry even though his teammates look like they would like him to pass the ball a bit earlier.

**61'** Curry going for the looong build up right now starts talking about the human discovery of fire.

**64'** Great choreo now by the Gospel Choir. The Queen is probably delighted they renounced the use of pyrotechnics today.

**68'** ⚽ **Goooal! Harry slides the ring on her finger nervously but it's good!**

**70'** ⚽ **Goooal! And Meghan on the other side with the counter. You can see she's done it before. Great Display! New score is 2-2.**

**86'** Another great presentation of the musical ultras echoing through the stadium now, so far the atmosphere has been top-notch regardless of the tranquil looking crowd. 

**91'** Bah gawd! [That's Agent 47's music!](https://youtu.be/N42MQJX4KoY?t=2h15s)

**95'** Meghan and Harry leave the box for the first time today. The fans are excited as it seems they're getting ready for their lap of honour.

**96'** On a side note - the Black Panther tribal calls have also made it to this final today.

**100'** Great run by the horses, some say they have lungs like Park Ji-sung.

**115'** Duchess Meghan still looking a bit nervous doing the signature royalty wave to the peasants but she'll get there. She sure looks happy to be here.

**144'** We are in the final minutes of this match and I would like to thank you all for the courtesy of having me. I declare Love as Man of the Match and I expect the celebrations to turn into riots in the sheets of Windsor tonight. So stay safe everyone. Goodbye! <3

[**AITA for not giving my son's future husband wedding jewellry?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/g5aahh/aita_for_not_giving_my_sons_future_husband) \- *Posted 2 years ago (all of the updates are in the one post)*

We are indian and in my culture it is tradition to give the bride a lot of gold sets of jewelry for her wedding. When each of my children were born, I bought a set for my both my daughters and a set for my son's future wife. I also have my own personal collection of wedding jewelry that I have divided for daughters and future daughter in law.

When my son came out as gay, I redistributed my collection to give them mainly to my daughters, but I kept a few sets in case my son ever had a daughter.

Now that my son is getting married, his future husband is wondering about his gifts. While it is tradition for parents to give their future son/daughter in law a gift, since he is a man I got him a kara (which is a sikh bracelet usually made of steel but I got him one made from solid gold, and my son has a matching one). He told my son that he doesn't want a religious gift for his wedding and that he found it tacky. That is fine if he doesn't like it. But I was going through my collection the other day to pull out pieces I want to coordinate for my outfits so that I can order my outfits in advance, and he saw me and wanted to see everything and give input. I also showed him the sets I have saved if they have a daughter. He is insisting that he gets these sets first and then he will give them to their daughter if they have one. In particular, there is a pair of emerald and diamond earrings I got from my own paternal grandmother that I would like to give my son's daughter (if they have one).

I told him no because I set these aside for just a granddaughter and not a son. If he chooses to wear jewelry to his wedding I really don't mind, but I picked all these sets special for a daughter or daughter in law and I don't want to waste them on a boy. These sets are to be worn with sarees and lenghas. I don't want him to have them

My future son in law is calling me homophobic for not sharing but I think it would be a waste to give them to a man to accessorize with a tuxedo, and I did not originally buy these for him in the first place. AITA?

(Also even though he likes jewelry he does not wear womens clothes so I know he would never wear it with a lengha the way this jewelry should be worn)

**EDIT**: Just to clarify, my son will be having a sikh wedding, and since he is religious my future son in law agreed beforehand that their household would be sikh and any future children would be sikh (son in law was raised catholic but isn't very religious now, but is spiritual. But being sikh means a lot to my son). Our religion (or at least the way we practice it) is very open minded, accepting, and loving so future son in law was on board. I got him a gold kara because that is the same gift I got for my other two son in laws. Also the kara does not have any religious text on it, if you aren't sikh you would assume its just a gold bracelet but anyone who is sikh would know it is

**SECOND EDIT** (have been reading the comments and need to clear things up): Future SIL is catholic and caucasian, his family is not as well off financially so we will also be helping pay for the wedding (just for the sake of equality because we also contributed x amount for each daughter's wedding, so we will give x amount to son's wedding). If I had a lesbian daughter, her wife would be getting gold sets of jewelry. It also wasn't my idea for their wedding to be sikh/children to be sikh. My son had a very difficult time after he finished his undergrad and he took that time to reconnect with god, pray, meditate, and his connection to sikhism is what anchored him and that is why before getting married he had to know if his spouse would be okay with that. Also when we say children being raised sikh, that means if they are a girl their middle name would be kaur and if they are a boy their middle name would be singh. ALSO, my son is a doctor and my SIL is a HS teacher so I don't think money is an issue.

**THIRD EDIT**: I've been reading all your comments and I really appreciate the discussion happening. But a lot of comments are hung up on the words ""wasted on a boy"". I understand why some people are offended, but I wanted to make sure you have the facts as well. [https://www.shaadisaga.com/blog/bridal-jewellery-inspiration-from-sikh-brides](https://www.shaadisaga.com/blog/bridal-jewellery-inspiration-from-sikh-brides) If you go to this site there are a lot of photos of sikh brides. Most of these wedding jewelry sets come together (headpiece, earrings, nose ring, choker/necklace). The choker/necklaces would not fit him, he does not wear nose rings, he would not be able to wear the headpiece, and he could just wear the earrings. Also the gold bracelets I have from my personal collection would not fit him so to give them to him symbolically would be a waste.

**UPDATE:** Hi Reddit!

Thank you so much for your responses, good or bad. But some of the things you replied to my post did upset me. Many of you applauded me for supporting my son, but mostly because you are so deprived of support from your own families that you were impressed that I was doing anything at all. I didn't like the way this sat with me. I don't want to be doing the bare minimum. Since my son and future son are staying with us right now, I decided to discuss some of the points you all made and work this out.

I showed him photos from my own wedding and we both agreed that the jewelry was *made* for female outfits and the female body. I also talked to him about the cultural significance of the kara, and what it means to me for him to have it, and he apologized and said he was out of line.

I think there was some tension because as many of you said, the word ""homophobic"" should not be carelessly thrown around. When my son first came out over 15 years ago, he interpreted my shock as disapproval and it created a barrier in our relationship. We put in a lot of time and effort in therapy as a family to make sure our son felt supported. So when my future son in law called me homophobic it made everything feel very hostile to me. But he explained that he was taking things personally mainly because his own family is outwardly accepting, but there are still little things they do that make him feel unwelcome which causes him to feel hypersensitive about these issues.

So we decided that a gay sikh wedding is NOT traditional, so the jewelry given should also NOT be traditional. We have decided to make a new tradition, and when everything is back to normal, we (me, my husband, son and future son) will be taking a trip to India so he can see my pind (hometown), and my husband's pind. And we will get a special set of gold bracelets that are more ornate than a kara for him and my son, and earrings made special just for him (heirlooms all start out as new to someone right?)

"I will tell you exactly what is going on here, this is critical information to understand if you are going to make money in this space. How prices work, and what moves them - and it's not money invested/withdrawn.","/edit: Hi /r/all. While I have your attention, I want to take 5 seconds of your time and bring some exposure to something that is threatening our existence as the human race. If you aren't interested, please skip down to the main article. I'm talking about finding a way to live sustainably on this planet, regenerative agriculture, where we get our food from, and how we can make sure that our kids and grandkids have something left once we leave. 

Please consider reading up on Permaculture, sustainable living, Forest gardening, Backyard Chickens, etc. Consider following what I did and do it for yourself. [This all used to be a useless lawn.](https://youtu.be/U79bql-JSqI)

[Bored for a night? Go watch ""Sustainable"" on Netflix.](https://sustainablefoodfilm.com/) 

Look into people like [Geoff Lawton](http://www.geofflawtononline.com/), Mark Shepard, Sepp Holzer, these people are going to save us. 

Want to make a small change yourself? Grow a tomato plant on your balcony in a pot. Reduce transport of the tomatoes you eat, and make ~$50 per plant in saved money. Want to do something bigger? Plant a fruit tree in your backyard. Maybe two. Maybe a raspberry bush. You are now part of saving the human race.

If everyone reading this planted a fruit tree, or even some wild flowers, we could save the bees.

While you are at it, planting a fruit tree has been shown to be one of the best investments on the planet. There's pretty much no investment on the planet that is more financially lucrative (while still being nearly bullet-proof safe) than planting a fruit tree.

You can get a tree at an end of sale auction for literally 5-10 bucks, and that tree will produce THOUSANDS of dollars of fruit for you in it's lifetime. Go spend $200 bucks at an end of season sale, plant 10-20 trees (if you have room), and that $200 will be worth tens of thousands of dollars of saved money.

Do it right, [set it up right and it's almost no work](https://youtu.be/bjBLVSo0zeY) because you offload the work to nature - as it has done for the last few billion years. Go learn how, let me show you how. If you do it right, it's zero work after you have planted and wood-chipped, and all you do is pull dollars off a tree.

_______________________________________________________

Original post starts below. I apologize for the shilling of Permaculture, but I think loss of topsoil will impact us all if we don't reverse it soon. We need soil, we need bees, we need food. We need to stop buying December Bananas in Canada. We need to start supporting local permaculture sustainable farms. We need to do this or we may not make it, and our grandkids stand no chance.

**I also expended the ""now what happens"" section, to explain how these pullbacks are a good thing, make crypto more stable, and why we keep seeing larger ceilings after every pullback... this stuff is really important for you to make money on this thing, if that's your goal....**

I've made a similar post in a few spots, and this is something that is absolutely critical for people to understand... what impacts price, and what is going on lately. Price has only a very minor correlation with money invested, and a major correlation with opinion. 

... and Humans are an emotional bunch.

So what drives price of any commodity, crypto, gold, pizzas, whatever? The money invested in it, right? Kind of, but not really. What if I told you that you could theoretically raise bitcoin from $15k to $20k by spending $1, and lower it from $25k to $1k by spending the same $1? Crazy right?

**AN EXAMPLE**

This is going to start out slow, I want to make sure I get everyone on the same page before I pick things up and lift the curtain. Stick with me here....

This is an example to help illustrate why prices aren't driven by money invested, but rather consensus and opinion. Lets imagine the following exists (we will use bitcoin as an example, but this is how everything on the planet works)

Lets say Bitcoin is currently priced at $10k (the last sale). From $11k to $99k, every $1k there is someone with a sell order of 1 full bitcoin. From $9k to $1 dollar, every $1k on the way down there is someone with a buy order of 1 full bitcoin.

So, right now if you wanted to buy bitcoin you have several options... meet the lowest seller's price of $11k, or, put your own buy order up, above the highest buyer's bid order (overcut them). If you decide to just place an order, the price doesn't change. If you decide the buy the $11k bitcoin, now bitcoins value is $11k, with a new lowest sell offer of $12k, and a highest buy bid of $10k. Someone else comes in an overcuts the buy bid and puts 1 BTC for sale for $11k. No trades are made until someone matches a buy/sell.

Okay, that's kindergarten stuff, most people here understand that. So how much money drove the price up in this situation? $11k, and BTC price raised 11/10, 1.10, or 10% from the last sale. Now the entire marketcap of BTC raised 10% (last sale multiplied by circulating supply). So it takes $11k to drive a 10% increase, right? Not at all. Lets look at what happens when news is released.

News comes out that Warren Buffet thinks bitcoin is a scam, a bubble, and he wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole because he only invests in things he understands and he doesn't understand crypto. People panic everywhere, and believe ""this guy is smart, I'm overvaluing this thing"".

Suddenly people don't want to buy this scam anymore, and the buy orders for $11k, $10, and $9k are taken down. 

At the same time, the people wanting to sell start to panic and just want out. The guy at $32k (who just had that offer up ""just incase it moons"") drops down to $11k sell order. The guy at $12k, who was the lowest, now undercuts him to $10k. 

The other buyers see the sellers undercutting and think that if these people want out, why am I buying in. The $8k guy pulls his offer, and so do the $7k, $6k and $5k guys. The highest offer is now $4k. 

The sellers panic further and the $14k guy undercuts the $10k guy and puts up a $9k sell. The $15k, 17k and 11k guys all see this flurry of panic and now a storm undercutting is triggered, to $8k, $7k, and $6k. The $8k order pulls his again and goes down to $5k. 

The price on the buy and sell orders has moved around a ton, but no sales have actually happened yet. Technically, BTC is still ""worth"" $11k, and the market cap reflects that. All this horseshit has happened, and it only happened in 10 seconds, but the price hasn't moved yet. 

The $27k guy wakes up and checks his phone. He had a $27k offer just incase the price moved also, and he also only has a tiny infinitesimal fraction of a BTC. Well, he decides ""he's out"" and fills $1 worth of the part of the $4k guys buy offer.

The latest price information is now updated, and BTC fell from $11k to $4k price per BTC with the movement of a single dollar.

This is exaggerated example, but this is what moves price. Not money in vs money out. The ONLY THING that moves price is perception.

**OPINION FLOW AND NOT MONEY FLOW**

Now the above example only happens if everyone simultaneously believe the same thing... this the asset they are holding is a steaming turd. What happens in reality is there's no black and white, it's shades of gray. It's flow in vs flow out. But again, not flow MONEY, but rather OPINIONS.

If 66% of the holders of something all of a sudden unanimously decide that their asset is overvalued, then they panic sell. Even if 33% of the people decide they are going to buy up as much as these panic sellers sell, if the panic is strong enough, and they are slitting eachother's throat to sell, then the buyers just happily sit and let them do that, and time their buys in. Very little money has to actually change hands in order for this price to crash, all that matters is the FLOW OF OPINION has to be swift and violent, and in majority. The sellers will leapfrog eachother on the way down, faster than the buyers scoop up their sales, and the net result is a crashed price.

Note, this happens both ways... fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) as well as overhyped FOMO (Fear of missing out). 

**So now what happens?**

Time goes by and all holders opinions of their asset hasn't changed. They still think it's worth $11k and they got great deals scooping up what these sellers were selling. The weak hands have left the market and have been replaced with holders. Overall, now a higher percentage of holders believe in the product they are holding and are unwilling to sell for the panic prices of the last week. Panic sellers were also replaced by new money, people who have wanted in for a while and are now in on their perceived ground floor.

Also, people who bought BTC at $1 ten years ago and have been looking for an exit to cash profits have now been replaced by either long term holders, or by these new people who are thrilled to have finally entered, and they are looking to hold long. 

So what happens on pullbacks? The number of people waiting to jump off the ship has decreased. The new ground floor is established. Are we done? Who knows, this could go on for another year, but what matters is that people who want off are getting off and people that want on are getting on. 

People who have panic sold and never believed in this in the firstplace... people who have wanted out for 10 years... they have been replaced by people who are now getting in on THEIR GROUND FLOOR, and are going to be holding long. The market is suddenly increasingly more stable today than it was yesterday, even though prices are down. 

**This is a good thing.** This is why crypto keeps bouncing back from pullbacks and reaches new higher ceilings and floors each time. Old money who wanted out, and new panic holders, they are gone. They are replaced with adopters, holders, believers in this technology. These people aren't selling anytime soon, because they believe that this thing is going to revolutionize the world. Every crash brings more of these people in, and removes more panic sellers out. 

**Moving forward**

Now news releases start coming out about how stock ETFs are being created, NASDAQ index funds, bank support, government support. Companies are using this tech, and companies who use blockchain for transportation are putting non-blockchain companies out of business. 

The people on the outside looking-in feel they are missing out. They now start coming in and buying. They start overpricing eachother on their buy orders, and eventually it gets close enough to a sell order that someone decides they are just going to meet the sell price. The sale goes through.

Sellers (HODLERs) see this action, and they start pulling sell orders off the table almost as fast as they fill. Sure some trades go through, and incoming money is driving the price up as market orders are filled. But what's also happening is people are seeing this flurry of volume, and sellers are pulling sell orders and placing them higher. 

Junk coins and pump and dump scam coins are dying by the millions. In their ashes, good solid technology projects whose coins have fundamental economic reasons for growth, these are rising. Corporate partnerships continue forming. The real world continues to create actual use cases. Companies start storing more and more corporate information on blockchain. Public companies use blockchain to store scientific research (See Canadian Research Council announcements), and blockchain acts as a Library of Alexandria. People can travel out of country without any monetary exchange, using their chosen cryptocurrency to buy the things they need abroad. The world is slowly actually USING this technology. 

Money is coming in, but more importantly, OPINION IS CHANGING. Literally nothing could have happened in terms of fundamentals, partnerships, etc... this can all be driven entirely emotional, so long as it's wide-spread and strong. Infact, the market could THEORETICALLY rebound in this way from $4000/BTC to $1 MILLION PER BITCOIN by the sale of ONE PENNY. $4000 sound low? Does that number make you uncomfortable? We may go that low. We may not. If we do, I'm not panicking and selling, I'm buying more.


**SO WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS? and where are we going?**

A lot of new money has come in from Nov-Jan, and they don't really know what they are investing in. Sure some of them have done great research and are smart investors but most people aren't and isntead they are buying Symbols and Names and trading on speculation. They are treating their favorite coins like a sports team, and will follow them irrationally off a cliff.

These new people came in and invested in cryptocurrency because their OPINION was heavily influenced in Nov, Dec, Jan, from media. They saw this money making machine called crypto. They were willing to pay huge, ride the wave up, keep buying, etc. They were ""ground floor adopters"" and were going to get rich.

They outnumber the old money by A LOT. Their OPINION MATTERS. It matters the most.

To keep this in perspective, they are also a VAST MINORITY of ""new money"" that will enter the game in the next decade. This cycle will continue over and over and over. 

Their opinion rose nearly unbounded and price rose accordingly. Market cap rose from 10B to 750B, and it could have been VERY LITTLE actual money that did this. How much did it need to be though? Literally ONE PENNY, theoretically. All that matters in moving price is MOMENTUM OF OPINION. I believe it has been estimated that as low as 6B USD was responsible for the bull rush.

These people then started hearing ""Bubble"", ""Scam"", Fake news about governments banning. They don't understand how technology wins, always. Crypto is beyond government control. If they could have stopped Bitcoin they would have done it already. 

**WHO IS DRIVING ALL THIS?**

Most investment opportunities go first to ""accredited investors"". You need to have multimillions in order to get in on the ground floor for most stock IPOs, and we're seeing that start to happen with coin ICOs. Bitcoin was a joke for the first few years, while lunatics picked it up. At this point, it was really too late to get in ""early"", and who would have wanted to anyways, it was all still a joke. So Wallstreet, banks, governments have generally watched on the sidelines as average Joes who were crazy enough to be early adopters and toss $100 on fake internet money slowly became millionaires. 

Not only that, but the idea of blockchain started to become understood. The power and value in it became understood. Not only as a way to track ""monetary value"" but for many other applications as well. Platforms were created, business uses brainstormed, products started being made. This thing started taking off, and wasn't a joke anymore. But regardless, big money wasn't in on the ground floor. They have stakeholders opinions to think of, and what do they say to investors when they lose all their money on magic internet points?

But they have woken up now. This thing has ""popped"" many times now and keeps recovering. This thing won't die. could they have been wrong all along? If they want in, how do they get in? They are no dummies, they have been controlling the world their whole lives? Look at the media experiment that Trump is doing? He is testing just how we work... you can do literally anything and we remember it for like 30 seconds, until the next news story comes out. We change opinions very easily. We are swayed very easily. We are their puppets. Media controls the world. They know their way in.

They have ONE WEAPON against cryptocurrency.

YOUR OPINION OF IT.

And they know it.

**Media.**

That's why FUD is so powerful and needs to be respected. It's why we need to read more than titles on news articles. We need to question what we read, **whether it's good news or bad news**. We need to think about ""what are the motives of the person saying this to me"". Does the government have a conflict of interest when they state that crypto is gambling? Do they have skin in the game? 

What about wall street? Does WEISS ratings possibly have incentive to come out with poor ratings? Do banks have incentive to lock accounts in order to ""protect"" customers from ""unsafe investments"" when their entire business model revolves around holding as much of your money as possible and making money off it? Do you think banks have any super secret hidden interest in preventing you from storing your money elsewhere? I'm not sure, maybe you can critically think about that.

Just understand that this goes both ways. When crypto is booming and Fox news is showing people how to buy $4 ripple on prime time, you may want to start putting in some stop loss orders. When the suicide hotline is stickied at the top of /r/cryptocurrency and everyone is panic selling, you may want to start picking up some firesale deals. 

So, the question is this... Is crypto undervalued or overvalued at it's price today? Where is the price going long term? **I'm not talking about it's use case**, I'm talking about in the **court of public opinion**, where is THAT going? Because THAT is what is going to drive price in the future.

Without a crystal ball, this is of course impossible to know. Do your own research and form your own opinion. It could very well be that the technology having a use-case will in and of itself drive opinion, and thus price. But make sure you understand that it's not the technology itself, it's not the value of the business itself, it's not the use case itself that will drive price, it is the publics OPINION of that thing which drives price. They are intertwined, but they are NOT the same thing.

TLDR: VERY VERY little money has to move around in order to swing prices drastically, up or down. Money in and out doesn't drive price, OPINION does. How do you let the news you read impact your opinion?How are you being played (on both sides, shilling and FUD).

Something is only worth what people think it's worth. Often that's based on reality, value, business, money, but often it's entirely emotional.

[Structure your portfolio in a balance, intelligent way, using risk methodology.](https://www.investinblockchain.com/cryptocurrency-investment-risk-management/). Invest money you are willing to lose. Support legitimate technology and teams who are actively driving their product to completion, coding, and marketing. Stop trying to make money overnight in pump and dump scams, or pyramid schemes. 

Every day, take one coin, do a deep dive on it, learn it inside and out. Look into their team and their past. Do that every day for a year, and you just learned 365 coins inside and out. Ask yourself the following key questions:

Have those members consistently jumped ship on previous projects? Is that where you want to invest in? Is their team capable of executing on their vision? Are they trying to solve world hunger, and their team is a few 16 year olds in a garage? How active is their github? Are they adding chunks of code regularly, or is a ghost town? Are they marketing their product at all? Or is marketing the only thing they are doing? 

What are the economics of their coin itself? Is it required to be used to gain access to their technology? Are there burns? How premined is it, and what portion do the founders hold? 

What about their vision? Are they trying to solve a problem that needs to be solved? What are the economics of that problem and how much money does the solution potentially save clients?

These are all questions you should be asking when you give your money to someone else. We're a lot more stable than we were - a correction was bound to happen. Too much early money wanted to cash in profits. These people have been replaced by new money who is holding on their own ground floor. The whole industry in general is still in very early stages. Rest assured that anyone reading this is still very much an early adopter. Just make sure you are investing in actual technology, and supporting capable teams, and not buying air. Buy the Googles and Amazons of Crypto, not the pets.com or flooz.com of cryptos.

Happy investing everyone.

"CMV: Compared to other developed nations, America is a “shithole” country for all but the wealthy and well-connected","TL;DR - The US lacks in almost every quantifiable category I can think of, especially when compared to European and Scandinavian nations. Only exception being if you have money and/or influential connections. Cue long list of stats and sources.

Repost removing references to the global you-know-what that ends in 19. I feel that our response to that situation is worth discussing, but the automod suppressed the original post and I don't feel those points are integral to the overall view for the purposes of this sub.

**Why I believe this:**

**We are not the most free -**

We are number 1 in [incarceration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_incarceration_rate), both total and per capita. Here, being convicted of a felony takes away your right to vote.

~~The US is~~ [~~45th~~](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Freedom_Index) ~~in press freedom~~ My view has been thoroughly changed on this, I recognize the ranking isn’t legitimate. But let's also not forget that in the recent BLM protests, police were [arresting journalists](https://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2020/05/29/minneapolis-protests-omar-jimenez-arrested-newday-vpx.cnn) and [attacked people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LozQg0oX-Gw) for recording them from private property.

**Or the most democratic..**

We are actually [25th](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index#Democracy_Index_by_country_2019)

**We have a massive wealth gap in our country -**

Almost [12%](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_in_the_United_States) of Americans live under the poverty line and almost [40%](https://www.google.com/amp/s/abcnews.go.com/amp/US/10-americans-struggle-cover-400-emergency-expense-federal/story%3fid=63253846) of Americans can’t afford an unexpected $400 expense.

The US has a [Gini coefficient](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_wealth_equality) (measurement of wealth inequality) of 0.852 (with a coefficient of 1 meaning almost complete wealth inequality).

We also have one of the [highest homeless populations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_homeless_population)

**Healthcare is only truly accessible by the rich -**

Average [health care spending](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2017/06/23/heres-how-much-the-average-american-spends-on-health-care.html) per person in the US hit $10,000 in 2016 and is predicted to be $14,000 by 2023. Explains why over [66%](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2019/02/11/this-is-the-real-reason-most-americans-file-for-bankruptcy.html) of bankruptcy filings in the US are due to medical-related expenses. Even just getting to the hospital in an ambulance here can cost you [thousands.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/ambulance-trips-can-leave-you-with-surprising--and-very-expensive--bills/2017/11/17/6be9280e-c313-11e7-84bc-5e285c7f4512_story.html)

**And we are not a healthy country -**

We are [number 12](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_obesity_rate) in the world for obesity, with over 36% of our population obese. By far the highest ranking Western country. EDIT - There are [23.5 million people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_desert) in the US who live in ""food deserts"" which is why I consider this a failing of the country rather than personal choices

The US consistently has more [deaths from treatable diseases](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/mortality-rates-u-s-compare-countries/#item-age-adjusted-major-causes-of-mortality-2015) than comparable countries (UK, Canada, France, Australia, etc)

**Quality education is only accessible to those with money -**

[Average cost of higher education](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/paying-for-college-infographic) ranges from $10k to $36k, compared to virtually nothing in other Western nations. This means higher education either burdens US students with a lifetime of debt, or keeps all but the wealthiest from attending.

The US is [31st](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.usnews.com/news/education-news/articles/2019-12-03/us-students-show-no-improvement-in-math-reading-science-on-international-exam%3fcontext=amp) in the world in reading, math and science, with 27% of top US performers registering as wealthy while only 4% as poor or disadvantaged.

**And when it comes to raising a child...**

You need a [ton of money](https://www.epi.org/child-care-costs-in-the-united-states/#/AL) for that too, due to lack of free child care and no federal family leave policy. And that link shows Alabama, probably one of the cheapest states to live in in the whole country.

**With the police** In response to police brutality, police around the country responded with unprecedented violence (going as far as to run protesters over with cars and shoot people (who aren’t even protesting) on their porches. They specifically targeted journalists trying to report on the situation. Nations around the world have condemned the US response to what have been by and large peaceful protests.

**And many Americans are still** ***very*** **dumb**

Consider that [only 83%](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/02/09/heres-how-many-americans-are-actually-anti-vaxxers/%3foutputType=amp) of American adults think that the measles vaccine, which has been around in some form since the *1960’s*, is safe. That’s almost 55 *million* Americans who are either unsure of its safety, or think it’s unsafe.

Certain (aka Southern) states get [textbooks edited](https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/07/13/421744763/how-textbooks-can-teach-different-versions-of-history) to portray the Civil War as being about states rights, not about slavery.

And many of those same Southern states have as little as [75% of students](https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/3cjhy5/high_school_graduation_rates_by_district_in_the/) with high school diplomas.

\*And...\*

[The American Dream is more achievable outside the US than inside](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.businessinsider.com/countries-where-intergenerational-mobility-american-dream-better-than-the-us-2019-8%3famp). Here is a [link](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/poverty/brief/what-is-the-global-database-on-intergenerational-mobility-gdim) to the raw data which I can't possibly get through, but in case anyone disagreed with the article.

\*Now for things that have become partisan for some reason\*

Despite Roe v Wade being a [bipartisan decision](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1971/70-18) by the Supreme Court, Republicans still campaign on stacking the court and directing them to overturn the decision, not only taking away a woman's right to seek an abortion, but grossly overstepping the separation of the executive and judicial branches, all because of religious values.

Trump has outright said he won't fund the post office so he can [disrupt mail-in voting](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-08-13/trump-admits-to-blocking-postal-service-funding-to-undercut-voting-by-mail), a clear attack on a basic democratic principle. And this was after he Tweeted about wanting to delay the election (even if it was a red herring to distract from the disastrous economic numbers). McConnell also refused to consider the stimulus bill due to the USPS funding, further screwing over average Americans.

And don't get me started on McConnell, the man who has basically made it his life's work breaking our democracy. Most famous of which being when he [blocked Obama's (legitimate) Supreme Court nomination](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mitch-mcconnell-blocks-obama-laughs_n_5df32430e4b0deb78b517322?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAI88DqE50bKSCi1nRR2OxCh5g_n5wwhEWQTWe8SZcenmhFk1KBTsf81C0_Q7SFkoystOeymFDgOG3A0zBGwY0XYg2zE_iKOG_BntswCwwubTEOKxlfd64HUEtrcrEvpYRxgUKIQNopeLs_Ihw5X5gtXmVsZFG5MF7ARdwf3GSC4k) just on principle.

We elect [bigoted](https://www.npr.org/2020/08/12/901628541/qanon-supporter-who-made-bigoted-videos-wins-ga-primary-likely-heading-to-congre) [people](https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-protests-for-racial-justice/2020/06/28/884392576/trump-retweets-video-of-apparent-supporter-saying-white-power) to represent our bigoted populous. Trump also gave Rush Limbaugh the Presidential Medal of Freedom, despite his [bigoted remarks](https://www.newsweek.com/rush-limbaugh-kamala-harris-radio-show-1525554).

People deny climate change, and our government is [destroying the environment](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2019/02/15-ways-trump-administration-impacted-environment/) for the sake of helping corporate interests.

In most of the country, the [""gay panic defense""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_panic_defense) is a legal justification for killing an LGBTQ+ person, and [conversion therapy is legal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_therapy#Legal_status) in most areas as well. Just a few examples of the deeply rooted homophobia in this country.

We're [number 1 in gun violence](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41488081), but large swaths of the country still prefer that to any form of gun control.

I'm sure I'm forgetting one stat or another, but I feel like it's been covered pretty sufficiently. Is America the worst country in the world? No. I'm not going as extreme as to say we live in a 3rd world country. But by the standards of other developed nations, the US lags *far* behind in almost every aspect I can think of.

For Americans who don’t have money (or aren’t willing to go into crippling debt because god forbid you want healthcare or to be educated), you’re basically screwed, and would almost certainly be better off living somewhere in Western Europe or Scandinavia instead. Change my view.

\*Feel like I should put a disclaimer that I am going by the numbers. I have lived a comfortable life here, as I'm sure many others have. But my argument is also that if you have lived a comfortable life here, either that indicates some level of wealth/power, and/or that your quality of life would still be better in a European/Scandinavian country.

Change my view.

\*Edit - Felt that I should include that our federal minimum wage is only [$3k a year above the poverty line](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/022615/can-family-survive-us-minimum-wage.asp) and unable to support a person living anywhere in the country

**EDIT 1 -** Since I keep getting the same points repeated to me over and over again, I'll just address them here since I just got the notification this hit the front page. I definitely won't be able to address even most of these comments at this point but I'll do my best.

Comment I made about homelessness - I know that made no sense, you can stop bringing it up

For the people who are telling me that I can't compare the US to European countries - I awarded a delta for someone who pointed out that it would be better to look at the EU as a whole. However, I don't think it's a legitimate argument to entirely write off comparing the US to individual countries, since while we may have a massive population (and GDP to match), our [per capita GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita) isn't that much higher than the countries I'm comparing it to.

And to reiterate again, I am not arguing that it is impossible to achieve a good life here in the US, or that we're a 3rd world country. Maybe you or your great grandparents immigrated here and made a good life for yourselves, and that's great. But overall, the US is not the best in terms of economic opportunity (like I addressed in the OP)",https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ibssr3/cmv_compared_to_other_developed_nations_america/,DrPorkchopES,2020-08-18 07:47:42,19506,changemyview
Live Balance Update live on all platforms - let's talk about meta,"Hey everyone!

&#x200B;

First off, we know you folks are fired up for info on Season 1 and Battle Pass. We still have work to do to get everything ready for prime time and won’t be talking about it yet. There are a lot of moving parts and coordination that go into big announcements and launches like this. I know the wait sucks but it’s coming and ask that you all please be patient with us.

Over the course of this week we’ll be talking about a few hot topics and we’re kicking things off today with a patch that is live on all platforms with some fixes, our first tweaks to the meta, and we'll give a preview of how we’ll be addressing Legend balance and hitboxes for Season 1. To talk about how we’re thinking about game balance and some changes we’ve made, I’d like introduce designers, Lee, Sean, and Brent who will give their POV and we’ll all stick around for a bit to answer questions.

**I want to set the expectation that there will be lots of things we can’t talk about yet. We won’t be confirming or revealing any future content or features in the questions.**

&#x200B;

I’ll let the guys take it from here:

&#x200B;

Leeeeeee-RSPN here with RespawnSean, Jayfresh\_Respawn & Scriptacus to give a quick update on how we think about live balance at Respawn and the current state of live balance for Apex.

&#x200B;

**HOW WE THINK ABOUT LIVE BALANCE AT RESPAWN**

https://preview.redd.it/i3dk528qzkk21.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=38e6830c2caaccd9ae06d7574c5169b26a36b785

***TL;DR - We make less frequent, better tested, higher impact balance changes in order to minimize the impacts on your time spent mastering the game.***

&#x200B;

A core philosophy of our development process for Apex Legends is to listen to player feedback, parse through all the data we get from the game, try things, and then playtest them a ton to get them just right. And… repeat. The goal is to ship polished, closer to the mark updates than if we got things out rapidly and iterated in the live environment.  We know y'all are putting a ton of time into the game and mastering every nuance (like Wraith portalling people off cliffs for the final kill lolz).  Our goal is to make less frequent, better tested, higher impact changes, so it minimizes the effects on your time spent mastering a particular mechanic, weapon, character, etc.  You shouldn't have to read our patch notes every few days just to keep up with how characters and weapons now work.

The exception here is that we will be very quick to adjust things that are way out of balance (for example, if we released a new character that completely dominates the meta from Day 1, we'd address it ASAP).

We didn’t want to make any hasty changes around launch, because we know a ton of players are still learning the game with lots of new Legends dropping in everyday.  The week one meta vs. the week two / three meta was meaningfully different from what we've seen, so want to make it sure it settles a bit before we act.  For example, Mirage’s power level has dropped a bit as players have adapted to getting Bamboozled.  :)  We want to let you know we're constantly reviewing the state of the game and considering and testing a variety of changes.

&#x200B;

**With the above philosophy in mind, I wanted to give a quick update on where we stand with the current state of character and weapon balance and provide an early preview of the things we’re planning to do for Season 1.**

&#x200B;

**WEAPON BALANCE**

https://preview.redd.it/fj9qpgvrzkk21.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a15f9b67aeacc3a8f072d1746c50737b505c0841

&#x200B;

Overall, we feel that the current weapons present solid options for a variety of gameplay styles.  We've found that the **Skullpiercer Wingman** has been on the stronger end, but it’s designed to be a weapon with a higher skill ceiling.  Our adjustments are attempting to move it more into the hand cannon space and away from full auto Deagle.  We’ve also adjusted the rate of fire of the **Peacekeeper with Shotgun Bolt** attachment, so players will have a larger window of vulnerability if they miss their shot.  Additionally, the scarcity of energy ammo and lower number of energy weapons overall has made those weapons difficult to main, so we’ve increased energy weapon and ammo availability.

&#x200B;

**WEAPON ADJUSTMENTS LIVE ON ALL PLATFORMS**

* **Wingman**
   * Rate of fire reduced from 3.1 -> 2.6 shots per second.
   * Skullpiercer Headshot damage multiplier reduced from 2.5 -> 2.25
   * Increased base hip fire spread and decreased the rate at which hip fire spread decays (shrinks back down).
* **Peacekeeper**
   * Shotgun Bolt rechamber rate has been reduced for the Peacekeeper only.
      * Level 1 mitigation 10% -> 7.5%
      * Level 2 mitigation 20% -> 13%
      * Level 3 mitigation 25% -> 16%
* Wingman and Peacekeeper availability has been reduced in all zone tiers.
* Increased availability of energy weapons & ammo in all zone tiers.

&#x200B;

**Why no P2020 or Mozambique buffs?**

* We love y’all’s ‘Bique memes, so we’re hesitant to lose that :P
* In all seriousness, our goal is to have a power curve of weapons.  ""Power curve"" just means that some weapons will be weaker and more common, while others will be stronger and rarer. Some weapons are intentionally less powerful until fully purp’d with hopups and attachments, while other weapons on the bottom of the power curve are your early game, better-than-melee, but-gotta-upgrade-out-of-ASAP weapons. We’ve seen some good feedback from players about how to make these pistols more exciting without losing out on the goal above that we’re listening to. We’ll be continuing to watch player data and feedback and trying things out internally but for now, they’ll remain the same.

&#x200B;

**ADDITIONAL PATCH NOTES**

* Fixed some script errors that we identified were occasionally causing disconnects during matches.
   * Caustic occasionally causing disconnects while throwing is Ultimate.
   * Pathfinder occasionally causing disconnects when activating a Survey Beacon.
   * Players occasionally causing disconnects when removing an attachment.
   * Gibraltar occasionally causing disconnects when pulling up his Gun Shield.
   * Players occasionally causing disconnects when entering Spectate Mode.

&#x200B;

**ADDRESSING LEGEND BALANCE AND HITBOX FEEDBACK**

https://preview.redd.it/taz9cycvzkk21.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7ca248b59aa8404898e173a365f861a34625b79f

***TL;DR  Our goal is to be able to have characters with different rig sizes, hitboxes and ability kits, and still have each character be roughly equal in power level, win rate and viability of pick.***

&#x200B;

For character balance, we look at a combination of things: pick rate, win rate, and character v. character matchup win rate among other metrics, and, of course, player feedback.  The results between the 5 small and medium rig characters have been positive - they are all in a safe band of relatively equal power.  Our large rig characters, however, are underpowered and their natural size appears to be a large contributor.  We’re planning on adjusting the size of the large character hitboxes to better fit the model.  If these changes are insufficient to bring these characters in line, we’re also considering a range of other changes such as natural damage reduction as well as individual kit power tweaks.  Because many of these changes are significant, we want to make sure they are heavily tested before they go live, in the event they are necessary.  Below is a quick overview on the roadmap of how we’re thinking about bringing large characters back in line.

Overall, we want to try to **increase the power level of the large rig characters**, before we consider large nerfs to everyone else.  While we’ve made small adjustments, we’re hopeful that increasing the power of large rigs is healthier than nerfing everyone else.

&#x200B;

**LEGEND ADJUSTMENTS WE'LL MAKE AT THE START OF SEASON 1**

https://preview.redd.it/1fp7x5pyzkk21.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=18b1834838da9493203847cf412cf5e39dd2d2e4

**Major balance changes:**

* Hit box size reductions and optimizations for Caustic, Pathfinder and Gibraltar
   * We’re better sizing hitboxes to character gear & model
   * Since these adjustments have a MAJOR impact on the game, we want to make sure there aren't any major bugs, so we didn’t want to rush them out
   * If these adjustments prove to be insufficient, we’ll consider additional adjustments during Season 1

&#x200B;

**Minor balance changes:**

* **Caustic**
   * *Traps* \- Reduced cooldown to 25 seconds from 30 seconds
   * *Traps* \- Increased radius and proximity radius by about 10%
   * *Traps* \- Removed a 1 second delay on the smoke dealing damage to players
* **Pathfinder**
   * *Insider Knowledge* \- Increased the number of beacons in the world to 12 from 10
* **Lifeline**
   * *Care Package* \- Removed slight chance that level 4 armor and helmets will drop
* **Wraith**
   * *Into The Void* \- Cooldown increased from 20 -> 25 seconds
* **Bangalore**
   * *Double Time* \- Reduced move speed bonus to 30% from 40%

&#x200B;

We appreciate all the feedback and please keep it coming!

[Comedy] How to piss off everyone you've ever met so badly that they can't even be bothered to insult you: the roast of Chevy Chase,"Today, we're going to dive into a forgotten corner of TV and comedy history. In 2002, Chevy Chase was roasted for the second time in the Friar's Club. Despite being largely forgotten, this event would have *massive* ripple effects. If you've ever watched a roast in the past two decades, especially on Comedy Central, chances are you've seen those ripples. Not to mention, the roast was enough to make Chase break down in tears, and reconsider his entire life. But I'm getting ahead of myself.  We'll get to the roast in good time. But to understand what happened there, it's important to understand *why* all of it happened (and on the plus side, there's a whole lot of tasty side drama in the comedy world). First, we have to answer the question ""Who is Chevy Chase""?

# I'm Chevy Chase, who the hell are you?

Born in 1947, Chevy Chase is a world renowned American comedian. Well, maybe not world renowned, but at least famous in America. Maybe not famous per se, but at least still decently well known. You've seen him in something. Probably.

Chase started his career like many comedians, running around and trying everything he could. Writing satirical articles, founding a comedy ensemble, working for a satirical radio show, etc. Finally, his work paid off. He became a writer for a show called ""Not Ready For Prime Time Players"", better known by its later title: Saturday Night Live.

**Because a sudden rise to fame has never gone to anyone's head.**

Shortly before the show first aired, Chase was added to the cast, and joined rehearsals. This became his big break, putting him squarely in the spotlight. He introduced every show but two, and was the anchor for Weekend Update, one of the show's longest running bits. His catchphrase ""I'm Chevy Chase, and you're not"" became extremely famous. He even claimed that his Weekend Update style was the direct inspiration for later comedy news programs like the Daily Show. During the show's run, Chase won two Emmy awards and a Golden Globe for his work on the show, and many have argued since that he [""defined the franchise""](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-lists/saturday-night-live-all-145-cast-members-ranked-146340/10-chevy-chase-167162/). Chase was a hit at the time, and was shortlisted by many as one of the funniest rising comedians in America. Someone even suggested that Chase could be the only person to replace the beloved Johnny Carson (although Carson disliked Chase, and replied that ""He couldn't ad-lib a fart after a baked bean dinner"").

**Live from New York, it's literally anyone** ***but*** **Chevy Chase!**

Chevy left SNL a few episodes into the second season, the reason for which is still unclear. Chase 's official story claims that his girlfriend didn't want to move out to New York, so he decided to move out to LA and marry her. That story is somewhat backed up by the fact that he'd negotiated out of most of season 2 in his contract with NBC, surprising producer Lorne Michaels (who hadn't been informed). However, there's still suspicion surrounding the episodes he *was* in. Supposedly, he injured his groin doing a pratfall in the first episode, forcing him to be hospitalized for the next two episodes. However, as eagle eyed fans noticed, the ""injured"" Chase was very clearly seen at the end of the first episode dancing around without any issue. Many have theorized that the episodes were a test run, to see if the show could work without Chevy, in anticipation of him leaving. Years later, an anonymous SNL cast member mentioned that he only used his engagement as an excuse to pin it on his (now ex) wife. In reality, he'd left the show purely out of a desire to make more money.

But why would the show want to see one of it's most popular actors gone? Well, as it would later come out, Chase was a *massive* pain to work with. Egotistical, cruel, and petty, he burned a *lot* of bridges with his fellow cast members, as well as producer Lorne Michaels. When he returned to host in Season 3, Chase reported the atmosphere felt ""poisoned"" against him, and he certainly didn't help himself by ordering people around, and trying to reclaim his spot on Weekend Update, all while using a frankly terrifying amount of drugs. Bill Murray (Chase's replacement) was antagonistic towards him, telling Chase frankly that no one there liked him, leading to a shouting match. Murray then told Chase ""Go fuck your wife, she needs it"" (Chase was having public marriage issues at the time). All of this culminated into Chase hunting Murray down minutes before the show, and challenging him to a fight. If you look closely at Chase's monologue, you can see some marks on his face from where Murray hit him. Chase would go on to host eight more times, racking up more and more problems every time. He'd harass female writers, make cruel jokes (like telling an openly gay cast member he should do a sketch about dying from AIDs) and generally just be a jackass to everyone involved. This came to a head in 1997, when he slapped Cheri Oteri hard in the back of the head, causing a furious Will Ferrell to bring the issue to Lorne Michaels, who banned Chase from the show. Chase was the 12th person to be banned from SNL, and the only former cast member to ever be banned from hosting. Although he's made a few guest appearances on SNL since, they're kept few and far between, and the hosting ban has been enforced.

**You win some, you lose thirty or forty others.**

Chase would initially find success striking out on his own, starring in a number of classic comedies like [Caddyshack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddyshack) (alongside Bill Murray funny enough), [Three Amigos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Amigos), [National Lampoon's Vacation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Lampoon%27s_Vacation), and [National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Lampoon%27s_Christmas_Vacation). However, Chase's success wasn't for long. He has been in a total of [62 different movies and TV shows](https://www.throughtheclutter.com/cornelius-crane-chase-1039.php), most of which are... they're bad. There's just no other way to put it. He milked National Lampoon's Vacation for *six total movies*, with the quality going downhill each time. He also tried to launch his own celebrity talk show, which bombed and was cancelled just four weeks in. His most recent movie in 2021 was [Panda vs Aliens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panda_vs._Aliens), which is... I mean, it's exactly what you'd expect. After Chase's initial success, he made bomb after box office bomb, with the failures seriously damaging his ego. He'd reportedly talked a lot of shit at SNL about how everyone else had no chance at a career, so seeing his former castmates all become more famous than him had to sting.

Chase's one big hit later in life was [Community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_(TV_series)), a show where he played a self centered egotistical old man with some seriously dated views. It's like the role was made for him. Members of the cast have been frank about how they only got a celebrity like Chase for such an unknown show was because of how far Chase had fallen, and as the show turned into a surprise hit, it seemed like it might be his ticket back to the top. However, Chase had serious issues on set. His toxic behavior continued, and he had serious issues with director Dan Harmon. At one point, he even refused to do a pivotal scene on the last day of filming, which required scrapping the entire scene. Harmon then made fun of Chase at the wrap party, playing some of the angry voicemails Chase had left him. Chase then left [another angry voicemail](https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/memo__120331184343.mp3), which Harmon played at a live event. Eventually, Chase was forced to leave the show after yelling the N-word during a heated argument on set. Later, costar Donald Glover would confirm that Chase [would make frequent racial jokes or insults between scenes](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/05/donald-glover-cant-save-you), trying to get Glover to crack or perform poorly.

**The** **~~best~~** **worst hits**

The behavior that cost Chevy both SNL and Community was present throughout his entire career (and frankly, his personal life too). It'd take too long to go through every single instance, but some include:

* Chris Columbus quit directing National Lampoon's Vacation before a single day of filming, because he had one dinner with Chevy where he was ""treated like dirt"".
* On the cast of Community, he told a female cast member ""I want to kill you and rape you"".
* His wife Jacqueline Carlin divorced him after just over a year, due to him making violent threats against her
* During a stunt in Three Amigos, Chase made a joke about director John Landis's lax safety precautions after his last film. The film in question? The Twilight Zone, where a stunt gone wrong killed a man and two children.
* Kevin Smith met with him to discuss relaunching the popular Fletch series, where Chevy ""went on to claim he invented every funny thing that ever happened in the history of not just comedy, but also the known world"". That one lunch ended any possibility of the series.
* Rob Huebel, a fan of Chase's approached him backstage to shake his hand, upon which Chase slapped him hard across the face
* Yvette Nicole Brown was asked who she would kick off of Community if she could, and answered with ""Chevy Chase"" before the interviewer even finished the question. She, along with Glover, has noted Chase's stream of racism towards them even before yelling the N-word.

**TL;DR: Chase is known for being incredibly difficult to work with, making cruel, insensitive, and bigoted comments towards those around him. Combined with a massive ego, and a career that tanked just a few years after it took off, Chase has a lot of issues both personally and professionally.**

# Just a bit more backstory, I promise.

Before we get to the big event, there's just two important pieces of the story left: The Friar's club itself, and Chase's first roast.

**What is the Friar's Club?**

The Friar's club is a 118 year old New York club whose membership includes some of the best known American comedians of all time, along with a number of other celebrities. There's too many to list, but [reading through their members](https://www.ranker.com/list/famous-new-york-friars-club-members/user-x), it was harder to find a famous person in entertainment that *wasn't* one of them than to find one who was. It's gone a bit downhill in recent years, but at the time, it still had a massive cultural impact. They also essentially invented what we now know as the roast, starting it as an in-house tradition in 1950, which they would later record and air on Comedy Central. The tagline was always ""We only roast the ones we love"", and you had to be a member to participate in the roast (as well as usually being a good friend of the roastee). Their [list of roasts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Friars_Club) includes some truly iconic names, all of whom were trashed by some of the best comedians of the era. And also Chevy Chase.

In 1998, Comedy Central signed a contract with the Friar's club to air their roasts. Now, the jokes and insults were no longer the subject of speculation and gossip, known only by the elite few who could witness it, *everybody* got to see the roast. This also marked a shift from some of the more classic comedic roasts to more modern content: swearing, sex jokes, etc. Once again, the Friar's club sent out ripples that would shape the future of comedy.

**The first roast**

Chase had been roasted once before in 1990, and apparently enjoyed the experience. The roastmaster was Dan Akroyd, with Clint Eastwood, Neil Simon, Larry King, Robin Leach, Richard Lewis, Gilbert Gottfried, Rita Rudner, Dana Carvey, Phil Hartman, Jon Lovitz, Dennis Miller and Lorne Michaels doing the roasting. The guests and audience included many of his close friends (along with celebrities like Rober DeNiro and Richard Pryor), who poked fun at Chase and his career. There's no recording of it, but reportedly, Chase's enjoyment of the experience was why he would agree to come back a second time.

At this point, Chevy was still 100% a douchebag, but his douchiness hadn't peaked yet, and his career was still looking good. He was riding the high of Christmas Vacation, and the end of his career wouldn't come until 1991, when three of his big films all flopped in a row. He hadn't yet been banned from SNL, and while many of the people who worked with him were aware of his reputation, it wasn't quite as publicly known.

# Finally, the big roast

If you want, you can watch the full roast [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2quRVxBvN6M&ab_channel=DaBOBnKiLL). I highly recommend that you do, just because words can't really convey the atmosphere of it (and also 'cause it's funny to watch Chevy Chase get mocked). If you don't, no worries, the whole thing will be recapped below.

The roastmaster (picked by Chase) was Paul Shaffer. The roasters were Todd Barry, Richard Belzer, Stephen Colbert, Beverly D'Angelo, Al Franken, Greg Giraldo, Lisa Lampanelli, Nathan Lane, Marc Maron, Steve Martin, Laraine Newman, Randy Quaid, Freddie Roman, and Martin Short.

**Who the fuck are these guys?**

If you read through that list of names and barely recognized anyone, you wouldn't be alone. Besides Colbert (who was still relatively unknown at the time) and Al Franken (who's famous for... other reasons now), there were *no* really famous people present. Steve Martin and Martin Short didn't even show up, they just sent in a pre-recorded video, as did Randy Quaid.

Not only were most of the roasters unknown to the audience, but to Chase himself. As they repeated throughout the roast, most of them were younger, and knew Chase only through watching him. They'd never worked with him before, or even met him before they were asked to tear him apart on TV. The only three that really had any connection to Chevy were former SNL castmate Laraine Newman, SNL's band member Paul Shaffer, and Beverly D'Angelo, who had played his wife in National Lampoon's vacation. (I'm aware that Al Franken had a connection, but I'm refusing to acknowledge his existence).

**Edit: I have received roughly ten million complaints about this. To clarify once again, famous people** ***present*** **because Short, Martin and Quaid never showed up. As for the rest of them, I'm just leaving them as is because it's funny how many people got genuinely angry at me over this.**

Reportedly, Chase would later ask one of the producers for the show why they hadn't invited any famous people. The simple answer was that they *had*... and everyone refused the invitation. ""We only roast the ones we love"" stopped being a sweet message, and became a condemnation. They didn't show up to roast him because they didn't love him.

**The jokes varied, but most of them focused around a few main topics:**

1. Chase's failed career, and the number of terrible movies he'd done.

>Paul Shaffer: You made us laugh so much. And then inexplicably stopped in about 1978.  
>  
>Marc Maron: At least I am a nobody at the *beginning* of my career.

2. The fact that none of Chevy's former friends or co-stars were willing to show up, so much so that they literally had a song and dance number called ""[We couldn't get anybody good](https://youtu.be/2quRVxBvN6M?t=105)"". The song included the line

>An OJ roast would have drawn more star power!

Martin and Short also joked in their video that they couldn't come because were filming the Three Amigos sequel without Chevy... a joke that probably would have been a lot funnier for Chase if the two of them weren't actually making a number of movies together without him.

3. Chase's drug addiction, which he had struggled with for years, and went to rehab for

>Greg Giraldo: Chevy is living proof that you could actually snort the funniness right out of yourself.

4. Chase generally being a dick

>Laraine Newman (reading from her ""diary"" about the first SNL cast): Danny is hilarious, and has invited everyone up to his bar in Canada. Belushi is a little gruff, but it's obvious he's a sweetheart. Chevy said to me ""You know, the Holocaust never really happened"".

That joke was in response to Chevy's reputation for antisemitism, which another roaster would mock by chanting in Hebrew during the roast.

**Hobbit said knock you out**

However, probably the most brutal roast of all came from Stephen Colbert. If you watch only one part of the roast, make sure it's [these few minutes](https://youtu.be/2quRVxBvN6M?t=2088). Unlike the others, Colbert didn't swear much, or rip into Chevy's personal life. He even joked about how shocked he was by people's cruelty towards Chevy. Colbert tore Chase apart by getting deep into his insecurities, joking about his washed up career, with lines like:

>The only thing I think of when I look at this man is there but for the grace of God go I. Why would I tempt the comedy gods to strike me down like this?  
>  
>A comedy lamprey, just sucking the joy out of everything I touch.  
>  
>But for some of these people, \[fame\] went to their head ... but this man never forgot what got him wherever he thinks he is.  
>  
>Before you attack him, think: There may come a day in your darkest hour when you are a shadow of your, albeit paper-thin self. And when that day comes, I hope that you are cheered up by something that Mr. Chase so famously said, ""He's Chevy Chase and you're not."" If that doesn't cheer you up, then I don't know what will.

Turning Chase's most iconic line into a burn against him had to sting, but Colbert's entire speech impacted Chase pretty heavily. With the others, the jokes were almost *too* over the top, it was easier to laugh them off. Imagine the difference between someone telling you ""I fucked your mom"" vs ""You have been nothing but a disappointment to your mother. You'll never be good enough for her."" Colbert tore Chase apart with the precision of a surgeon, all with a pleasant grin on his face.

**I hope this doesn't awaken anything in me**

After Colbert was ""Sir"" Randy Quaid, whose [poetry tribute to Chevy](https://youtu.be/2quRVxBvN6M?t=2292) was... it's an experience. This has basically no relation to any of the rest of the drama, but it's too bizarre for me to not mention it here. It features a swimsuit-clad Quaid frolicking in a pool, moving into various sexual poses as his voiceover recites a Shakespearean poem. Eventually, he moves towards a pair of women's legs spread wide... which have a picture of [Chevy Chase](https://imgur.com/a/YA4OAmj) over the genitals.

You may now pause reading to go scrub your eyes with bleach.

**The grand finale**

As the last roaster left the podium, and as Chase was thanked for being a good sport by the head of the Friar's Club, all eyes turned to him. This was his big moment, his time to strike back at everyone. You can say a lot of things about Chevy Chase, but lacking the ability to insult people isn't one.

Chevy took the podium, and... [not much happened](https://youtu.be/2quRVxBvN6M?t=2392). He kicked it off by saying ""I agree with everything that's been said"", threw back a joke or two, then left. His voice broke as he noted that this would be the time the roastee got even with all the other comedians, ""but there just fucking aren't any"". In total, the whole thing took around 80 seconds, much of which Chevy was silent for. When he did speak, his trademark arrogance and bravado was gone.

**And he cried like a baby coming home from the bar**

Chase himself admitted that after the show, he went back to his hotel room and had a breakdown. He reportedly cried for hours in a depressive state, with Paul Shaffer coming to comfort him. [According to Chevy](https://ew.com/article/2012/04/03/chevy-chase-archive/), the roast was the moment he hit rock bottom, when he truly realized how badly he'd fucked up with his former friends. The roast truly devastated Chevy, and would haunt him for years to come.

Looking back through the broadcast, you can see an almost linear progression of Chevy's reactions, growing more and more stolid as it went on. He'd barely react to jokes beyond the bare minimum, or sometimes not react at all. He just sat there stone faced with sunglasses on.

The show was supposedly pretty uncomfortable for everyone else. Looking back at past Friar's club roasts, it's hard to not notice the difference in the atmosphere. Members of the crew, audience, and cast have all expressed some levels of discomfort with what happened, and many of them just wanted to move on and act like it never occurred. Even in previous roasts, no matter what was said, you could fall back on the fact that people liked you. The sad fact is, nobody in that room *really* liked Chevy all that much, and a decent number of them *hated* him.

Reportedly, Chase even insisted that certain jokes be cut entirely from the show before it was broadcast. I was unable to find proof of if Chase was specifically involved, but the broadcast has clearly been edited. There's shots where Chase seems to transition from his sunglasses to his regular glasses quickly, and some of his roasters seemed to have vastly different speaking times. Some of them barely even mentioned Chevy, so the idea that some of their jokes got cut isn't too far fetched. Compared to the other Friars Club roasts that aired, this one ran on the shorter end, suggesting there could be around 5-8 minutes of cut footage. And considering what actually made it onto the broadcast, you have to wonder how truly gut wrenching those insults must have been.

Regardless of editing, Comedy Central would only ever air it once before shelving it.

# What comes next?

At some points during this writeup, you may have wondered where the big sweeping changes were. After all, a roast of a celebrity by a bunch of strangers, many of whom aren't comedians, who use extremely personal jokes and attacks? That's not anything special, it's pretty much *every* major roast, especially on Comedy Central.

The thing is, this roast is a large part of what created all of those. Obviously, it's less shocking to us now, because it has become the norm, but at the time, this was an entirely new experience. And it was an experience that Comedy Central jumped on with enthusiasm. After Chase's roast, their five year contract with the Friar's club ended, and it was not renewed. Some suggested that Chase personally sabotaged the deal, although more likely it just represented the end of a short experiment. Comedy Central then started producing their own roasts, following the new model. Turns out, people are a lot more entertained by celebrity drama than close friendships, and they're happy to see someone famous knocked down a peg or two. Plus, you don't need to actually get comedians if you just hire a writing team for all the celebrity guests, and star power attracts a lot of viewers.

Roasts have since become a classic part of comedy culture, with Comedy Central firmly at the peak, and Chase's legacy enshrined forever -- just maybe not the way he'd want it to be.

Believe it or not, Chase is [still an asshole](https://ew.com/tv/chevy-chase-responds-snl-community-costars/). He has gone in and out of retirement, currently stating that he's only semi-retired. He also tried to convince Lorne Michaels to let him host SNL again... just minutes before he walked his daughter down the aisle at her wedding. Priorities man. If you want to take the time, there's a good [Washington Post article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/lifestyle/chevy-chase-cant-change/) that dives into Chevy, and discusses the nuances, exploring his abusive childhood without excusing his current behavior.

Also, the roast was spoofed by [American Dad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtUYAHTmJI&ab_channel=santaonthecross), sunglasses and all. Funnily enough, that's how I learned about this, and decided to make a writeup.

I guess the moral of the story is simple: If you're an asshole, a narcissist, a bigot, a douchebag, a sexist, a failure in every conceivable way... at least you're not Chevy Chase.",https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/xk73sy/comedy_how_to_piss_off_everyone_youve_ever_met_so/,EquivalentInflation,2022-09-21 19:53:24,19336,HobbyDrama

[](//#net-big) **MATCH EVENTS**

**00'** [](//#whistle) Just about ready for kickoff. Remember, if anything's wrong with the thread, please ping my username or send me a message!

**02'** [](//#info) Early free kick here for Germany in a great position as Toni Kroos is barged off the ball unfairly. It was another attempt at a cute free kick from the Germans but doesn't come off.

**04'** [](//#info) And Argentina counter immediately, as Higuain's shot is dragged wide. Good early chances for both teams! The shape of the match is already clear - the Germans comfortable in possession, but Argentina look set to counter.

**09'** [](//#info) Dangerous moment for Germany as Messi tears the right side apart, but he can't find a teammate with his final pass in the box.

**18'** [](//#info) Ouch! Kramer is on the floor after having taken a heavy (accidental) shoulder to the face. Interesting to see what will happen here - a reminder that Kramer started this match as Khedira got injured in the warm-up.

**21'** [](//#info) Higuain, Higuain, Higuain! The Napoli man is *gifted* a one-on-one by a poor header from Kroos, but he's completely missed the target! You can't miss those, not here!

**29'** [](//#yellow) Schweinsteiger picks up the first yellow card of the match after bringing down Lavezzi. The free kick is played short, but doesn't come to much.

**30'** [](//#flag) Higuain has the ball in the back of the net but he's strayed way, way offside and the goal is rightly chalked off! The striker should have done better, but the German defenders didn't shower themselves in credit either.

**31'** [](//#sub) Kramer, meanwhile, has not been able to recover and his World Cup final comes to an end. Chelsea's Andre Schürrle comes on for him.

**34'** [](//#yellow) Fairly outrageous challenge from Höwedes on Zabaleta earns him a yellow. No complaints from the German and he might consider himself a bit lucky...

**40'** [](//#info) Messi runs through just about everyone but Boateng is there at the death. The match's frantic early pace is showing no signs of slowing.

**45'** [](//#info) A German corner comes in and Höwedes smashes it into the post - could he have done better with that? The rebound goes straight to Müller, but he's offside.

**45'** [](//#clock) After 2 added minutes, the first half is brought to an end. It's had just about everything, barring a (legitimate) goal - hopefully we'll see that plus more of the same after the break.

^___________________________________ **HT** ^___________________________________ 

**45'** [](//#sub) The injury-ravaged Sergio Agüero is making an appearance. Lavezzi has come off for him - bit of a risky move from Sabella.

**45'** [](//#whistle) We're back out and ready to go for another 45. Maybe the last 45 minutes of the World Cup, if one of these almosts finds its way home.

**47'** [](//#info) Argentina are the ones who've started better and ohhhh Messi. He's clean through, but his shot whistles narrowly wide of the far post.

**57'** [](//#info) Couple of... curious decisions from the referee in the last few minutes, calling fouls that could've either gone uncalled or been given to the other team. Germany's ball now, though, having worked their way back into the half.

**64'** [](//#yellow) Mascherano miscontrols and fouls Klose to stop him capitalising from the error. He'll take the yellow, first Argentinian player to be booked on the night.

**65'** [](//#yellow) Agüero doesn't want Mascherano to be lonely and so charges into Schweinsteiger rashly. He's promptly booked too.

**70'** [](//#info) The pace and sharpness of the first half hasn't quite carried through after the break, as both teams find themselves getting a bit scrappy in the final third.

**75'** [](//#info) Messi carves out a chance after working his way around the German box, but his strike sails wide. 15 minutes left, and it's unclear which team will be able to find the moment of magic.

**78'** [](//#sub) Rodrigo Palacio is Sabella's roll of the die here, and Higuain will be the man to come off. He might yet regret his big, big miss in the first half.

**82'** [](//#info) The Germans playing well in the last few minutes but as Özil tees up Kroos for a trademark drive, the Bayern man tamely slides it wide. Not long left!

**86'** [](//#sub) Gago comes on for Perez. That'll be Sabella's third and final move, while the Germans still have two substitutes remaining as extra-time closes in.

**87'** [](//#sub) Löw makes one of those subs now, as Mario Götze comes on for Klose, the tournament's all-time record goalscorer.

**90'** [](//#clock) It could've all been over by now, but after 3 added minutes the teams remain level. Off to extra time we go, then - for the third World Cup final in a row.

^___________________________________ **FT** ^___________________________________ 

**090'** [](//#whistle) Goalless still, then, as we go into extra time. 30 more minutes - at least - left in this match, let's see what these tired legs are capable of.

**091'** [](//#info) Just 30 seconds into it and Schürrle almost finds the moment! Denied by a sharp save from Romero, and the Argentinian counter-attack is quickly snuffed out.

**097'** [](//#info) Palacio with a huge chance from close range but he tries to outsmart Neuer by lifting it over him, and his effort sails well wide of the mark!

**105'** [](//#clock) It's all German possession in extra time so far but still nothing to separate these teams. Penalties looming large now, but 15 minutes left to do something about that.

**109'** [](//#info) Schweinsteiger's taken a fair few heavy challenges, most notably a couple of recent ones from Mascherano and Agüero - both of whom have already been booked. The German is bleeding. Careful!

**113'** [](//#ball) **GOAL GERMANY!** Mario Götze has scored! Schürrle plays him in with a clever dinked cross and Götze provides the deadly finish that this match has been missing!

**120'** [](//#sub) Özil is replaced by Mertesacker. There will be just 2 minutes added on to this second half of extra time. Germany on the brink! 

**120'** [](//#clock) And that's it! A last minute Messi free kick comes to nothing, and the referee blows for full time. Germany are the Champions!

"Thesis: SI is Upwards of 2000%, GME is a $100 Trillion Bubble Waiting to Pop, and DTCC is Attempting to Crash the Entire Market to Socialize Losses. Change My Mind.","# Thesis Statement / AKA TLDR

I believe Naked shorting has allowed GameStop’s circulating shares to number above 1 Billion, with a minimum short interest percent of float to be 2000%. Thus, it can also be concluded retail likely owns upwards of 500 million shares and the financial impact is likely upwards of $100 trillion. DTCC came to this same conclusion around mid-March and is now actively taking steps to crash the entire market, allowing them to socialize losses to other major players in the market.

# EDIT Nov 17, 2022:

This is a thesis argument; thus, it is not financial advice.

This thesis is primarily math and logic-based speculation; thus, it should not be considered as factual.

I hope that by sharing these thesis:

* Apes will gain useful insights.
* Progress the knowledge within our community.
* It can serve as some entertainment and dat sweet confirmation bias porn we all love.
* Most importantly, the community can review and critique this argument allowing major holes in the logic to be discovered and the thesis altered as necessary.

&#x200B;

[DTCC mid-March, 2021](https://preview.redd.it/ygly4d4piop61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=61691ce29f3ffe2abe223f2c3ac3a7ed870ea13d)

To begin, a quick summary of the previous 6 months. Since I was not here for most of this, I will briefly summarize the events as I see them in hindsight (with little sprinkles of speculation thrown in).

It starts with two opposing sides that cannot agree to disagree. On the short side, GameStop is viewed as a dying brick and mortar company. Melvin Capital, and many other major players, heavily short GameStop, likely even installing several GameStop board members to guarantee a collapse. However, long players (i.e., retail, RC, Blackrock, etc.) see deep fucking value in GameStop. Using the famed and feared “buy and hold” tactic players on the long side put shorts in serious trouble as they have infinite loss potential. I believe as early as fall 2020, Melvin realized their firm might be on the line. This situation worsened for them in the December and January runup that ultimately was Melvin Capital's death sentence. But everyone works for someone, right? Enter in Citadel…

I suspect sometime in the December and January timeframe Citadel realizes they may be looking at tens to hundreds of billions in losses due to Melvin’s short position. So, what does our boy Ken Griffin decide to do? He takes a calculated risk to reduce the negative impact of Melvin’s short position by allowing a fake “squeeze” to occur causing a retail sell off. With the combined powers of price manipulation, media control, and contacts throughout the financial world (one need only watch the Godfather series to understand the importance of this last one), what could possibly go wrong? Well, some guy who’s not a cat didn’t sell, and apparently he wasn’t alone. Furthermore, GameStop’s situation dominated the media and brought in millions of new retail apes (myself included as I previously had zero experience/interest in stocks). I believe this also had another important effect: Citadel now knew the entire multi-hundred billion dollar firm was on the line and **Citadel no longer needed to manage risk**.

We see this in sports all the time. When a team is already losing a game, they will often play all out offense because what is the difference between losing by 1, 2, 10, or 50 points? In any of these outcomes, the game is lost. A similar philosophy can be applied to finance since what is the difference between owing $500B, $700B, $1T, or $50T when the firm is only worth $300B? In any of these outcomes, the firm is lost.

**Throughout February, I believe we saw the effects of hundreds of millions of naked shorts entering circulation**, bringing the price down from about $300 to $40. During this time, we see aggressive media campaigns aimed at distracting potential investors from GameStop and causing investors already long on GameStop to sell (remember silver, weed, RKT, and many more). This game of smoke and mirrors lasts until the middle of March when DTCC can peers into the void and see exactly what the situation is. I think what they saw terrified them, and now they are fighting to not hold the entire bag. Enter in DTCC…

Now we get to the more interesting stuff.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Some Background on DTCC

&#x200B;

To start, WTF even is DTCC?

&#x200B;

[Unrelated Picture](https://preview.redd.it/zyxa96wxnop61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6669920d38be33dcb128517e814295192a136dc)

Well, let us start with a copy pasta definition that I think I took from Investopedia:

&#x200B;

>The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) is an American post-trade financial services company providing clearing and settlement services to the financial markets. It performs the exchange of securities on behalf of buyers and sellers and functions as a central securities depository by providing central custody of securities.

&#x200B;

What does that even mean?!? To answer that the following is taken from “Who Really Owns Your Money?” an article written by Anthony Freed (I will include a link at the end):

&#x200B;

>The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation is the biggest bank in the world that you have probably never heard it. They happen to be the **registered owners of 99% of all paper (stocks, bonds, securities, etc.)**. Scary, but true.  
>  
>The **DTCC retains registered ownership while you as the peasant investor have the designation of beneficiary** of the instruments.

&#x200B;

This begs the question, WFT is a beneficiary owner vs a registered holder? Taken from the aforementioned article:

&#x200B;

>REGISTERED HOLDER- A Registered Holder literally possesses, owns, and holds, his stock or bond with his name appearing on the face of the certificate. The company that issued the certificate has registered the owner’s (holder’s) name on their official books. This is the safest way to own a paper asset. You literally possess the fully registered certificate and only you can transfer or sell it. By all Rights and definition of law, you are the owner. You have it, you hold it, you possess it, and you keep it. You have the complete control over it.  
>  
>BENEFICIAL OWNER- A Beneficial Owner is nothing more than a beneficiary, “One who is entitled to the benefit of a contract”- A Dictionary of Law, 1893. All book-entry stocks and bonds you purchase make you the beneficial owner, not the registered holder. The owner of a book-entry stock or bond is the entity or name that it is registered under.

&#x200B;

WTF?!?!?!? Nobody actually owns anything?!?!? That makes no sense! Well, there is a good reason and Freed covers that as well:

&#x200B;

>And they have a perfectly good reason for it - with electronic trading, it is impossible to make timely changes to registered ownership of the paper.

&#x200B;

Ohhhhhh, so **in order to speed up transactions, the DTCC was created to keep all the assets of the stock market under one owner**, well that makes sense. And surely an organization that is the sole owner of 99% of the stock market would be highly regulated and extremely transparent to insure peace of mind for all beneficiary owners, right? I mean, that must be the case, right??? RIGHT?!?!??!??

Personally, I do not believe this is the case after watching the “The Wall Street Conspiracy” movie that has been posted about previously (I will include a link at the end as I also reference this in multiple locations). My take on the TLDR of that documentary is:

**The DTCC is and has always been very loosely regulated, with a history of being culpable regarding naked shorting practices.**

&#x200B;

Also, this is taken from the DTCC Wikipedia page under a section titled “Controversies” (also contains an interesting final sentence):

&#x200B;

>Several companies sued DTCC, without success, over delivery failures in their stocks, alleging culpability for naked short selling. Furthermore, the question of whether DTCC is culpable for naked short selling was raised by Senator Robert Bennett and the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA), and discussed in articles in The Wall Street Journal and Euromoney.\[53\]\[54\] DTCC contended that the suits were orchestrated by a small group of lawyers and executives to make money and draw attention from the companies' problems.\[54\]  
>  
>**Critics blamed DTCC, noting that it is the organization in charge of the system where the naked short selling happens, alleging that DTCC turned a blind eye to the problem**, and complaining that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had not taken sufficient action against naked shorting.\[54\] DTCC responded that it had no authority over trading activities, and could not force buy-ins of shares not delivered,\[55\] and suggested that naked shorting was simply not widespread enough to be a major concern. The SEC, however, viewed naked shorting as a sufficiently serious matter to have made two separate efforts to restrict the practice.\[54\] DTCC has said that the SEC has supported its position in legal proceedings.\[55\]\[56\]\[57\]  
>  
>**In July 2007, Senator Bob Bennett, Republican of Utah, suggested on the U.S. Senate floor that the allegations involving DTCC and naked short selling were ""serious enough"" to warrant a hearing. The Senate Banking Committee's Chairman, Senator Christopher Dodd, indicated he was willing to hold such a hearing.\[58\] No such hearing was ever held, however.** Representing state stock regulators, the NASAA filed a brief in a 2009 suit against DTCC, arguing against federal preemption as a defense to the suit. NASAA said that ""if the Investors' claims are taken as true, as they must be on a motion to dismiss, then the entrepreneurs and investors before the Court have been the victims of fraud and manipulation at the hands of the very entities that should be serving their interests by maintaining a fair and efficient national market"".\[59\] The suit was dismissed. Critics also contended that DTCC and the SEC were too secretive with information about where naked shorting was taking place.\[54\] DTCC said it supported releasing more information to the public.\[55\]  
>  
>In recent years this controversy only increased as the reactive effect of Gamestop stock dramatically damaged the DTCC's reputation.

&#x200B;

So, you are telling me a single organization that has a history marred with accusations of shady activity is the registered owner of the entire $60T of stock market assets?

Yes.

And now that I blabbered about the background and DTCC, please allow me to argue for my actual thesis statements.

&#x200B;

# Thesis statement 1: 2000% SI minimum

&#x200B;

“Overtime. Eventually. Math and logic will balance the equation. 💎🙌🏼🦍🚀🌝” – u/bebiased

Soooooo, how the hell am I getting 2000% SI as a conservative estimate? Well, it all starts with these daily “glitches”. To add some credibility here, I am degreed in both electrical and computer engineering, so I come from a technical background. Often it is useful to look at complicated puzzles with the “black box” approach. I will make the following assumptions in doing so:

&#x200B;

* There is significant evidence to support synthetic shares are being created. I don’t give a single fuck **how** they are being created, just that they **are** being created.
* Citadel is a financial beast with multiple different arms that by law must be firewalled (likely meaning no electronics traffic exists between those arms).
* One arm of Citadel might be responsible for creating synthetic shares (might have some connection to the hundreds of millions of shares in darkpools), while another arm is responsible for closing the IOUs.
* This transfer of IOUs cannot be done internally within Citadel due to the firewall. Thus, this transfer must hit the open market in some manner. Once again, I don’t give a single fuck **how** this is happening, just that there is reason to believe it **is** happening.
* Computers are incredibly stupid, but they make up for that with being able to do simple tasks unbelievably quickly and accurately (this is what gives them the illusion of being smart).
* Some computer somewhere saw the traffic accounting for the transfer of IOUs and said “I take number from here and put it there”, because that’s what it is programmed to do. It just so happens the place it puts numbers was in TOS, in plain sight of us retail apes.
* Diagram to illustrate this argument:

&#x200B;

[Sorry the boxes aren't actually black. Credibility -69](https://preview.redd.it/pnz2f1r5top61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=05e40c13a8ea15eb74d179b9c145655b00814190)

&#x200B;

Now that I have presented a theory on how this might be working, let us test this theory against the 94M share “glitch” from February. If my theory is correct, one would expect to see the following:

* Unusually high buy pressure in the days after the February 22 glitch.
* This buying pressure should continue until roughly 94M volume has been recorded.

[DD of 94M Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lq0lwu/why_is_there_a_94_million_share_buy_order_in_for/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

So, let us look at the chart and see. Just FYI this is the 4-hour chart.

&#x200B;

[I can't even fucking read](https://preview.redd.it/pu1rwnohtop61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8ba60d2991f700aec444efadc02f6e5dfe1b151)

I don’t know about you, but my confirmation bias just did a six to midnight. In this chart, we see immense buying pressure push the stock from roughly $45 to reconsolidating above $100 after the buying pressure wore off. Furthermore, we see the buying pressure fall off a cliff once 94M total volume is met (with a bit of FOMO into after market). In my opinion, this is too damn convenient to be coincidence.

**The Major Counter Argument I See**

If there are over 1B shares (and counting) currently waiting to be closed out, why has the price not gone into the 1000s already? While I believe my theory can tell us the number of shorts that need to close, I think it tells us absolutely jack shit about the timing. Also, we have not had stellar success as a community with predicting the timing, so personally, I’m not going to speculate on it.

But what have we seen on the charts since March 23? The average daily volume from March 17-23 is roughly 15M per day (remember that includes a quad witching day). Interestingly, the average daily volume since that 634M “glitch” has been almost 37M. Furthermore, if you look at the price change from close to close the price moved from $181.75 close on March 23 to a $181.00 close on March 26 (interesting that both are right below $182 as this is where the ""glitches"" have come in at). When looking at the price alone, it is not apparent there was significant buying pressure, but we must also remember what was happening concurrently.

Remember this?

[Entire Russel 2000 is Shorted](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mbu916/not_my_post_but_it_is_being_downvoted_like_crazy/)

Thus, there was buying pressure coming in from somewhere to cancel out the operational shorting being done on the Russell 2000. I believe the greater than 1B shares waiting to be purchased is the source of this buying pressure.

&#x200B;

**Summarize Thesis Statement 1**

So if I am correct and these “glitches” are giving us an opportunity to see short positions attempting to sneak through the market, I believe we are looking at a running total of roughly 1.2 billion shares. With float being right under 50M, we are looking at (I’ll use 50M and 1B because I’m lazy and prefer speculating on the conservative side):

1,000,000,000 / 50,000,000 = **2000% SI of float at minimum**

1,000,000,000 / 70,000,000 = **1429% SI of outstanding shares at minimum**

Following DD is a more precise calculation indicating **2654% SI of float**

[DD Fair Share Value and SI Estimate](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/me2dm1/true_value_of_a_gme_share_is_722783/)

In my opinion, these numbers should not be that surprising when you consider Citadel has likely been operating with zero risk management and I believe Zach had been predicting SI was possibly 900% weeks ago. And that prediction was made with all the information we knew at the time. And oh yeah, remember this?

&#x200B;

[Apparently there’s dark pools with hundreds of millions of GME shares trading in them.](https://preview.redd.it/o1ergi37wop61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=51a87172d2f60ee5367a73e7a68e2535a086460d)

As history has proven, these financial bubbles are often significantly bigger than anyone realizes before it pops; thus, I consider 2000% SI to be conservative.

&#x200B;

# Thesis Statement 2:  I Estimate a $100 Trillion Financial Impact

&#x200B;

[Hopefully](https://preview.redd.it/8xy2udjswop61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a09ee762ba50d29d1736a6f6b0a0d44cd9bb661)

&#x200B;

And how the fuck did I get to that number? Just hear me out…

To begin, this requires my first thesis to be true (which I give that I reasonably high chance to be the case).

So let’s do some share counting…

The most recent Institutional ownership numbers I saw was 95M shares.

[Fintel Data](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme)

So who owns the other 900M+ shares?

*I’m legitimately asking here since I believe this is one of the weakest parts of my entire argument. I’m hoping the comments have some discussion on this.*

Since I believe retail is the largest non-reported group of shareholders, I’ll assume **retail is likely sitting on 500M shares** and chalk the other 400M up to “shit that I don’t know about” (once again I would love feedback here).

While the exact mechanics of a squeeze this size cannot be predicted, I believe it is reasonable to assume 1 billion shares will have to be reduced to 50M (this is also not even accounting for any of the float being locked up in mutual funds, etfs, etc.).

Thus, by these numbers, the price should continue to rise until roughly 90% of retail shares have sold.

So do you think 10% of retail shares (50M) will be held until at least $2M per share?

If so, 50M \* $2M = $100T

Although this also assumes people only hold until $2M per share. **Personally I don't know why anyone would sell themselves out so cheap at $1M, $2M, or $10M per share.**

And that doesn’t even account for the other 950 million shares!

&#x200B;

**The Major Counter Argument I See**

Literally anything that proves my share counting estimates to be substantially wrong, and believe me, I would love to hear more information on this. I’m looking forward to feedback on the logical steps taken in this section.

&#x200B;

**Summarize Thesis Statement 2**

So if there actually are 1B+ shares currently trading, what effects does this have on the situation as a whole? Well, I believe this makes the potential financial impact one to **dwarf** that of 2008 housing crisis, the 2001 dotcom bubble burst, Black Monday of 1987, and the 1929 Great Depression (accounting for inflation). **By my estimation, the financial impact is looking like $100T on conservative side.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Thesis Statement 3:  DTCC is the Final Boss in its True and Terrible Form and Aims to Crash the Entire Market to Socialize Losses to Other Major Players

&#x200B;

>It’s quite obvious that the stock markets are going to ‘crash and burn’ at some future date and for some ‘unknown’ reason… The Great Depression is about to be repeated, and it will be as **deliberate** and **manipulated** as the first one that began with the stock market crash of 1929. We are, without a doubt, on the brink of the **Mother of all economic Depressions**.

The above quote was penned in 2003 and used by Anthony Freed in his “Who Really Owns Your Money?” article published in 2008. I couldn't find who originally penned this.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Getting Back to DTCC**

Remember way back in the Recap section when I said ""Enter in DTCC..."" and left that on somewhat of a cliff hanger? Well now let's unhang that cliff and get to the real crazy shit of this post.

So where would I get the idea that DTCC is the next bag holder in line after Citadel? Well thankfully I came across a lovely DD while typing up this post which saves me from having to explain it:

[DD Explaining DTCC Bagholding Potential](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/meifir/for_the_newbies_on_this_page_trying_to_get_a/)

And the image from that DD so you don't actually have to click the link:

&#x200B;

[Holy Shit this picture is big. Too bad I have no idea how to resize it. Credibility -420](https://preview.redd.it/pddmzw8z5pp61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=effd1864014086b09aea7a133dfa5fde854f9618)

&#x200B;

But remember, I'm speculating the potential bag to be held could easily be $100T, and if DTCC is only worth a measly $60T, they could potentially be fighting for their life (thank goodness they have insurance).

I suspect when DTCC peered into the short positions of Citadel and company they came to a similar conclusion as my previous two thesis have arrived at (I believe the date for this was March 17, but I'm not certain on that). To the best of my knowledge, DTCC is not a player in the market like Citadel, rather I believe they have taken over a puppeteer role towards those in short positions. While DTCC would not literally be the institution making moves on the market, they are dictating what short side institutions do. This idea has risen largely from the sudden change in various tactics we are seeing, which I will cover now in no particular order.

&#x200B;

**New tactic:  Weird Available Short Data**

I noticed a weird change in available shorts starting in the middle of quadruple witching week. Until that week the available shorts had been slowly but steadily showing a general trend of approaching zero. However, that week they actually hit zero, but the interest to borrow stayed low. Due to supply and demand, the rate to borrow should only increase as the available shares to borrow decreases. This activity simply makes no logical sense. The following is a great example of the borrowable shares as I'm typing this.

[Huh?](https://preview.redd.it/u94n2h11bpp61.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d91c09e549947a69b9302af1acb8b2eb8a10788)

At the lowest, we see 10,000 shares available with a meager 1% interest rate. Since this makes no logical sense due to supply and demand, allow me to speculate on the actual play happening here.

I believe the borrowable shares with a low percent fee are being used as honeypot to attract to players to take short positions. This would help socialize losses as potentially more greedy HFs would short GME for a bargain price. This would allow DTCC to first liquidate any new short player assets before having to start dipping into their $60T

&#x200B;

**New Tactic:  Death Threats**

What if I told you that DTCC potentially has a history of doing it? It may sound like a conspiracy theory, but after seeing the main stream media manipulation throughout this whole ordeal, I'm thinking some of you might be more open to believing conspiracy theories. Honestly, I'm not sure I believe it myself, but it's certainly interesting to note that Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne claims he received death threats. Byrne is one of the main people of interest in The Wall Street Conspiracy video and very actively tried to raise awareness of naked shorting. The following is another article which he recounts the details of the threats:

[Patrick Bryne Discusses Death Threats](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/12/14/a-tycoons-deep-state-conspiracy-dive)

&#x200B;

>Byrne has claimed that his work exposing naked shorting resulted in death threats. After he went public with his allegations, he was summoned to a Thai restaurant in Great Neck, Long Island, where he and two associates met a man who warned them that Russian gangsters were planning to \[**Redacted**\] Byrne for having exposed a profitable source of income. The man told them that he had received a package containing *matryoshka*, Russian nesting dolls, with Byrne’s name on a slip of paper inside the smallest one. Around that time, Byrne said, someone threw a pair of garden shears through the window of the Manhattan restaurant that his girlfriend managed.

Now I wouldn't it past our boy Kenny Griffin to put out death threats, but I find the timing to be a little suspicious. Perhaps death threats are a tactic used by a new player that entered the game...and maybe that would be the player with the most lose...maybe that would be DTCC...

I'll be interested to see what is sent to this account in the coming days.

**New Tactic:  Shorting the Muthafukin Russel 2000**

Great DD here that explains mechanically how this ETF shorting works.

[DD Operational Shorting and Market Instability](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/md69vo/dd_why_gme_went_up_today_and_how_citadel_may/)

Some quotes I especially like to feed my confirmation bias (the all caps make them even better):

>UPTICK IN RECENT ETF NAKED SHORTING SIGNALS THAT THEY ARE CLOSER TO THEIR REGULATORY LEVERAGE LIMITS.  
>  
>EXPECT MORE NAKED SHORTING OF ETFS BUT THESE ADDITIONAL SHORTING MAY LEAD TO ENTIRE MARKET INSTABILITY

It appears a market crash would happen primarily from increased volatility caused by this excessive shorting. While apes are immune to volatility, in fact many of us were born in it, the boomer market as a whole fears volatility like the plague. If the major indices start to experience just a fraction of the volatility GME experiences on the daily, a rapid sell off is almost guaranteed. Especially if you consider we are currently in one of the most bullish markets ever, and that alone makes the market naturally due for a little correction. And oh yeah, apparently there's some boat stuck in a ditch somewhere? Doesn't seem that important to me, but people are talking about it.

&#x200B;

But is it really Citadel that would be attempting to cause a market crash? Personally, I'm not convinced.

&#x200B;

Let's play a little game called DTCC or Citadel. It's a simple game. I type out a question and then I type an answer to that question. And everyone else get to read my 2 AM stream of consciousness thesis argument after I post this.

Who benefits the most from a market crash?

DTCC

Why? Citadel is already in the position of losing anything, not even a market crash where they load up on short positions can cancel the infinite loss potential of their GME short position. Although, **Citadel loading up on short positions in broad market ETFs before a market crash could serve to lessen the blow of their position for DTCC**.

Who has the financial leverage to cause enough instability for a market crash to occur?

DTCC

Citadel issued $600M in junk bonds several weeks ago. I doubt their financial leverage is at its strongest. And even if it was, Citadel is not the largest fish in the pond; there are fish in the financial pond that would eat Citadel, burp, and ask for more. But what if DTCC is feeding Citadel the necessary leverage and calling the shots for our boy Kenny Griffin? Well then my thesis would be correct.

&#x200B;

**The Major Counter Argument I See**

Its getting late and I don't feel like making one.

&#x200B;

**Summarize Thesis Statement 3**

In my opinion, there's too many new tactics that conveniently started popping up around the time DTCC was able to see exactly what short positions on GameStop major players had taken. Thus, I believe a new entity started calling the shots for those on the short side. When I ask myself, ""who has the most to lose?"", I find the most logical conclusion to be DTCC. I think there is potentially a $100T bag that short side players will end up holding, and most of that will be falling on DTCC (and then the Fed since not even DTCC can hold a bag that big). So what's the only play they have left? Well they can't hope to get us to sell as the last two months have proven. But they can attempt to extend the losses to as many other institutions as possible. I just go back to the quote included at the beginning of this section:

>The Great Depression is about to be repeated, and it will be as **deliberate** and **manipulated** as the first one

# Final Thoughts

While typing this up I saw the posts that Josh would be stepping down from doing DD due to the evolving death threat situation. This got me thinking too...

I recall thousands of years ago there was some bearded, sandal wearing guy who mentioned something along the lines of (forgive me paraphrasing):  **""to think a sin is to commit it""**

Ya know, I kind of agree with that statement in this context. In my opinion **these threats should be matched with the same response as there would be to murder**.

Now, this will never happen in the eyes of the law, but that doesn't mean it can't happen in the eyes of apes. So I got to thinking some more...

**If someone is willing to take a human life for these shares, perhaps they're far more valuable than we ever could have anticipated. Truly, what is the value of a human life?**

Each ape will have to come to that conclusion on their own, but **I don't see myself wanting to part with them for a pitiful $10M, $20M, $50M, $100M or $1 Billion per share**.

Has anyone heard of the Left/Right Game? (Part 1),"A few points before we start. 

Firstly, I am not the protagonist of this story. I just went to university with her, and though she went on to become a professional writer, I most certainly did not. She'll be taking over from me further down but, until then, please forgive my slightly awkward delivery while I give you guys the necessary context. 

Secondly, I don't know what you will make of the following events, and I'm sure many of you might consider it all some sort of hoax. I wasn't present for any of what transpired in Phoenix, Arizona but I can vouch for the person who wrote the following logs. She is not, and has never been, a fantasist.

Ok so I once knew a girl called Alice Sharma. She was an undergrad at Edinburgh Uni the same time I was. My educational poison was History, a degree which has greatly benefited my career as a bicycle repairman. Alice Sharma studied journalism, though perhaps ""studied"" isn't the word. It's not an exaggeration to say that she lived and breathed the subject. Editor-in-chief of the campus paper, recognisable voice of student radio. She was frustratingly tunnel visioned, and she was a journalist in her own right before anyone gave her a professional shot. 

We met in student halls and became friends almost immediately. A meandering waster trying to stay off his parent's farm and an intrepid, ambitious reporter may not seem the most obvious pairing, but I learned not to question it. She was inspiring, and smart and she proofread all my essays. I’m not too sure what she saw in me.

We were eventually flatmates down in London where she chased her dream and I chased my tail. She got a few jobs here and there, but nothing befitting of her skills. After months of fruitless internships and rejections, Alice called a flat meeting, telling us that she was moving to America, accepting a position chasing stories for National Public Radio. The job had come out of the blue, the result of a hail mary application she thought had been dismissed out of hand. We threw her a bittersweet going away party and put the room up for rent.

That party was the last time I saw Alice Sharma. She dropped out of contact a few months after her departure. Complete radio silence. I assumed she was just busy so I carried on with my small but happy life, and waited for her to pop up on television with some important words below her name; Chief Correspondent, Senior Analyst… something like that.

The radio silence was broken last week, and, for reasons you’ll glean further down, I’m less happy about it than I would’ve thought.

Arriving home from work I found a lone email in my otherwise bare inbox. An email that would later be described as ""suspicious"" by my tech literate friends. Despite being born in the early 1990's I didn't own a computer until uni, and I've missed several important lessons in the world of cyberspace. Lessons like ""Don't call it Cyberspace"" of course and more importantly, ""Don't open emails with no text, no subject and no sender's address.""

I realise most of you would have deleted this anonymous, blank email immediately, my friends certainly would have, but beyond my basic ignorance about online safety, something further compelled me to open it. The only thing of substance in the entire message was a zipped folder, labeled:

Left.Right.AS

I don't have to explain what I was hoping those final initials stood for.

Opening the zipped folder I found myself staring at a stack of text files. Each one titled with a date, continuing sequentially from the very earliest file ""07-02-2017"". (To any Americans in the room this is the 7th of February).

I’ve since read the files a few times, and shown them to some friends. They don't know what to make of it either, but they certainly aren't as concerned as me. They think Alice is just in a creative writing phase and, if I didn't know her, I’d have to agree. But the thing is, I do know her. Alice Sharma only cares about the truth and if that's the case with these files, insane as it may sound, then it’s very possible my friend has documented her own disappearance.

The people who suggested this forum said you discuss strange occurrences etc. If you guys have come across anything to do with the below, or know any of the people involved, then please send any information my way.

The Left/Right Game
[DRAFT 1]
07/02/2017

They say great stories happen to those who can tell them. Robert J. Guthard is an exception to that rule. As I sit at his table, sip his coffee and listen to him recount the past 65 years it sounds like he's reading off a shopping list. Every event, his first job, his second wedding, his third divorce, none of them receive more than one or two sentences. Rob plows through the years, the curt, dispassionate curator of his own personal history. Yet the story itself is so fascinating, so rich with moments and so wildly meandering that it somehow stands on its own merits. 

It's a great story, no matter how you tell it.

By the time Rob was 21, he'd gotten married, had a son, worked as a farmer, a mover, a boat engineer, and grown estranged from his spouse... Here's him talking about that.

**ROB:** Course my wife started to get dissatisfied, I was away a while.

**AS:** For work?

**ROB:**Vietnam.

**AS:** You were in Vietnam? How was that for you?

**ROB:** I ain't never been back since.

That was everything he had to say concerning his first divorce, and the entire Vietnam war.

Rob had four marriages after that, and even more professions. After the war he worked with a firm of private detectives, got shot at once by the mob, then he became a courier, which is how a poor boy from Alabama got to see the world.

**ROB:** I been to most of the continents with that job. I been to India. You from India?

**AS:** My mum and dad are from India yeah.

**ROB:** See I could tell.

He'd been arrested once in Singapore, after one of his packages had been found to be full of white powder. He spent three days locked up before someone got around to checking the substance. It was chalk. 

A friend he made during his brief custody, Hiroji Sato, invited Rob to stay with him in Japan. Just getting over the breakup of his third marriage, Rob took the offer. He stayed in Japan for another 5 years.

**ROB:** The Japanese are good people. Good manners. But they got all these urban legends and ghost stories that Hiroji was crazy for, spent all his free time chasing them down. Like, you heard of Jorogumo?

**AS:** I don't think so""

**ROB:** Well she's this spider lady lives in the Joro Falls round Izu. Meant to be real pretty but real dangerous. Hiroji took us out there to get a picture of her.

**AS:** Did you ever meet Jorogumo?

**ROB** Nah she didn't show. None of them did. I didn't believe at all until we went to Aokigahara

Aokigahara, affectionately titled the Suicide Forest. The next stop on Rob's adventure. It's an area of woodland at the base of Mount Fuji, a notorious hotspot for young people looking to take their own lives. Hiroji, Rob's ghost obsessed jailmate turned best friend, took him to Aokigahara to chase ""yurei"" the ghosts of the forest.

**AS:** Did you find anything? In Aokigahara?

**ROB:** Well I ain't gonna ask you to believe me. But I was a PI. Professional cynic. Even I can't deny there was a spirit in those woods.

From that moment on, Rob's sentences start getting longer. A childlike excitement creeps into his voice. I get the distinct feeling we're moving beyond background, beyond Rob Guthard's old life, and towards his new one. The one he wants to talk about. The one that led him to contact the show.

**ROB:** It walked up to me through the trees. Looked like static you see on a TV screen but it had a human shape almost.

**AS:** Almost?

**ROB:** It was missing an arm. It reached out to me but I bolted outta that forest so fast. Hiroji never saw it, holds it against me to this day.

Hiroji had good reason to be annoyed. Rob says that Mr Sato had been going to the forest 2-3 times per year for three decades. To have a rookie come along and claim to have seen a yurei on his first trip? I'd be more than a little cranky.

But Rob didn't stay a rookie for long. In fact, it was in those woods that he discovered his current passion. The supernatural, or more accurately, the documentation and investigation of urban legends. Legends like Bloody Mary, the Jersey Devil, Sasquatch. Rob has looked into them all.

**ROB:** I figured if one was true then who knows how many others could be.

**AS:** How many have you proven so far?

**ROB:** Since Aokigahara? Ain't none of em had any proof to em. Except for one. That's why I called you guys up.

At this point, Rob can’t hope to repress his smile.

The Left/Right game appeared on a paranormal message board in June 2016. Only a few people frequently visited the forum and, of these regulars, only Rob took an interest in the post.

**ROB:** The whole thing had a level of detail you don't see in other stories.

**AS:** What details grabbed your interest?

**ROB:** Logs. High quality pictures. The guy documented everything, said he wasn't gonna play the game anymore. I think he wanted somebody to keep investigating.

**AS:** And you were that somebody.

**ROB:** That's right. I set about trying to verify his information right away.

**AS:** And how did it go?

**ROB:** Well... It didn't take long to realise the Left/Right Game is the real thing.

The rules of the Left/Right game are simple. Get in your car and take a drive. Take a left, then the next possible road on the right, then the next possible left. Repeat the process ad infinitum, until you wind up somewhere... new. The rules are easy to understand, but Rob says their not so easy to follow.

**ROB:** There ain't all that many roads where you can turn left and right and left and right and keep going. Most of the time you find yourself at a dead end or needing to turn in the wrong direction. Phoenix is built on a grid system so you can keep going left and right as long as you need to.

**AS:** Did you move to Phoenix for the Left/Right game?

**ROB:** That's right.

I try not to seem incredulous. Selling your house in another state, packing up and moving your whole life to Phoenix, Arizona just to play a game you saw on the internet? It seems like insanity. Rob smiles as he reads my expression. I can clearly read his expression too. ""You'll see."" It says. ""Just wait.""

I wouldn't have to wait long. Included within the 9 page submission Rob sent our show, was a long list of suggested items the chosen reporter should bring with them. Clothes for three days, a pocket knife, matches, bandages. There were also a set of qualifications the reporter should have. The ability to drive, basic vehicle maintenance and its human equivalent... first aid training. He didn't just want to talk about the Left/Right Game. He wanted to take one of us along.

Rob leaves a short while later to embark on a few errands, ""Prepping the Run"", as he calls it. He shows me to the guest room and we part ways, on good terms but very much aware of the other's poorly veiled opinions. He knew I saw him as a charming obsessive, chasing after a fairy tale. He saw me as a naive cynic, on the cusp of a new world. All I could think as I heard the front door close is that by tomorrow afternoon, one of us would be right.

More after this.

When I wake up the next morning, Rob is in my room, holding a tray which he'd knocked on the bottom of to rouse me. I don't manage to record the start of our conversation.

**ROB:** - I got bananas, strawberries, chocolate syrup. We got some more downstairs but I wanted you to wake up to something good. We won't be eatin' this stuff on the road.""

Rob has made me waffles. He sets them down on the night stand and talks through the coming day as I eat. I'll admit it feels a little uncomfortable, waking up in a stranger's home to find said stranger already standing over me, but I quickly move past it. I tell myself that he’s an older man, accustomed to living alone in his own house, not usually having to think about boundaries. Anyway, he certainly knows his way around a waffle iron.

**ROB:** We hit the road at 9. I wanted to give you time to get ready before everyone shows up.

**AS:** There are other people coming?

**ROB:** We got a 5 car convoy on the road today. They'll be here in an hour.

This is the first I’ve heard of a convoy, and to be honest I’m surprised. The game is Rob's obsession, and I’m here at his request. The idea that anyone else would have an interest in today's drive is a little perplexing.

Half an hour later, sated, showered and dressed in the ""functional clothing"" Rob had so painstakingly outlined, I take my pack out to the porch. Rob’s already there, waiting for his associates to show up.

**AS:** I thought you'd be conducting a few more errands.

**ROB:** If you ain't prepared by the morning of, you ain't prepared.

**AS:** Hah ok I guess that's fair. Oh, Rob is the garage locked? The inside door won't budge and I wanted to mic up the car.

**ROB:** Yeah it's locked up I'll open it for ya.

**AS:** Thank you.

**ROB:** In fact it's about time I wheeled her out. Fair warning Ms Sharma, she's a thing of beauty.

To Rob Guthard, beauty took the form of a dark green Jeep Wrangler. Rob climbs in and lets it roll out of the garage, where it dominates every inch of driveway. The car is large; four doors with a roof enclosing the entire compartment. It’s also been modified extensively, yet another example of Rob's dedication to the game.

**ROB:** What're you thinking?

**AS:** I think you're two caterpillar treads short of driving a tank.

**ROB:** Hah yeah I fixed her up good. I put the winch in, heavy duty tires, the light rig on top is LED's. They'll make midnight look like noon but they don't use hardly any power.

**AS:** Aren't Jeeps open top usually?

**ROB:** Not all. This is the Unlimited. I like to have a covered car when I head on the road.

I climb in and stow my pack. Rob had removed the back seats to afford more storage space. The place is packed to the brim. Jerry cans of gasoline, barrels of water, rope, snacks and his own neatly packed set of clothes.

I wonder if the rest of our convoy would take the game so seriously.

**ROB:** We got Apollo coming up in 10 minutes. No one else has given me a time. I sent the schedule weeks ago, this always happens.

**AS:** His name's Apollo?

**ROB:** That's his call sign. Apollo Creed I think he said.

**AS:** Why are you using call signs?

**ROB:** Did I not tell you? Oh yeah we're gonna use call signs on the road, keep communication clear.

**AS:** What's your callsign?

**ROB:** Ferryman.

**AS:** ... What's my call sign?

**ROB:** I thought about it. I was thinking London, you're from London right?

**AS:** I'm from Bristol.

**ROB:** Bristol? That’s fine I guess.

It’s less than ten minutes before Apollo turns the corner. Rob jumps out of his chair and paces briskly over to the edge of his property, as his first guest pulls up and steps onto the sidewalk.

Apollo vaguely resembles his namesake, dark skinned, tall and noticeably well built, though it’s clear he couldn’t be less of a fighter. This Apollo Creed is all smiles and seems to have a penchant for laughing at his own jokes.

**AS:** How far have you come?

**APOLLO:** I've come out of Chicago. Took three days hard driving.

**AS:** And you know Rob from the forums?

**APOLLO:** Everybody knows Rob, Rob's the god! Ahaha

Rob walks over to Apollo's car, gesturing him over to talk shop. Rob’s clearly impressed with Apollo's choice of vehicle, a blue Range Rover packed to the ceiling with kit. I was more impressed with Rob himself. Somehow this 65 year old farmer's son had become respected in a vast online community. My dad is Rob’s age and he's just discovered copy and paste.

The rest don't take long to arrive. Two Minnesotan librarians, also around Rob's age, pull up in a grey Ford Focus. They’re brother and sister, and they've shared ghost hunting as a hobby their entire lives. I find it hard to suppress a smile when they meekly introduce themselves as Bonnie and Clyde.

**CLYDE:** We would have gotten here sooner we had to drop by to get some blankets. Pleasure to meet you ma'am.

**AS:** Pleasure to meet you too.

**CLYDE:** Would you be the journalist?

**AS:** That's right.

**CLYDE:** You used to write for the town paper didn't you?

He's talking to his sister there, she nods. Clyde is clearly the spokesperson for the pair, yet they both seem incredibly shy. Whether they admire the famous outlaws, or just the name, it's pretty clear they couldn't be more different from the real thing.

Next to show up are Lilith and Eve, English Lit students at New York University and proprietors of the YouTube channel Paranormicon. Unlike Bonnie and Clyde, Lilith and Eve have no issue holding a conversation. As soon as they learn who I am, and what I do for a living, they attempt to conscript me for an expedition to Roswell.

**LILITH:** We have a friend there, he's been seeing some-

**EVE:** -He's a seismologist

**LILITH:** Yeah and he's been recording readings over the years that show subterranean movement. Predictable movement.

**EVE:** We're going to see him in July, but we could work it around you if you're free.

**AS:** I'll have to check my schedule

**EVE:** OK cool let me give you my email...

They quickly hurry off to film an intro for their latest video, featuring a quick interview with Rob, who seems pretty welcoming of the attention.

The last two cars arrive within a few seconds of each other. A lithe, strong willed older lady who goes by Bluejay and a younger man going by the callsign “Ace”. Bluejay has arrived in a grey Ford Explorer. Ace, much to Rob's annoyance, has arrived in a Porsche.

**ROB:** Did you think that's gonna help on the road? I didn't write that-

**ACE:** It's my car. What am I meant to do,? It's my car.

**ROB:** You didn't read my itinerary, you got nothing packed in there.

**ACE:** I did read it sir OK? Calm down. I have a bag, I won't ask you for anything.

**ROB:** Well I know that's true.

Ace and Rob were off to a bad start. Ace takes a phone call, and despite my best efforts to get an interview with Bluejay, she doesn't seem interested in talking to a journalist.

With five cars, and seven travellers waiting for a green light, Rob hands out radios and charging packs, then launches into a quick safety briefing. Wear seatbelts. Stay in position. Communicate clearly and often. It’s at this moment I start to feel a little dismay. I like Rob, and clearly so does everyone else. He'd convinced all of them to drive across the country to join in with his game. I start to worry what will happen in the likely event that the whole thing isn’t real. Would Rob lose the respect of his peers? Would he accept failure when it comes? After seeing the effort he’s put into these runs, the next few hours have the potential to be wildly uncomfortable.

With a smile and a few encouraging words, Rob ends his briefing and beckons me over to the Wrangler. I clamber inside and make myself as comfortable as possible.

**ROB:** You ready for this Bristol?

**AS:** I'm ready.

**ROB:** Ok then let's hit the road.

The Wrangler pulls out of the driveway, and the convoy follows in order of arrival. Apollo, Bonnie & Clyde, Lilith & Eve, Bluejay and Ace keep a steady pace behind us as we come up to the first corner.

Rob slowly and deliberately turns left, checking on the others in his rear view mirror. He looks back to the road as Ace’s Porsche completes the first turn of the game. Shortly afterwards, Apollo checks in on the CB radio.

**APOLLO:** This is Apollo for Ferryman. How many to more go Rob? ahahaha

**ROB:** Hah as many as it takes.

I can tell Rob wanted the to reserve the radio for something other than Apollo's quips. But he seems to like Apollo enough to let it slide. I'm not sure Ace would have received the same treatment. We take the next right, then another left. Now safely assured that everyone's following correctly, Rob speaks my thoughts aloud.

**ROB:** You're wondering the same thing Apollo is.

**AS:** What do you mean?

**ROB:** You're wondering how many turns we're gonna take before we hit some wall or something. Before you find out this is all just a story.

**AS:** Does that disappoint you?

**ROB:** I'd be disappointed if you weren't thinking something like it. But now we're on the road I gotta say something and you gotta listen to it.

**AS:** OK...

**ROB:** We're coming up to a tunnel soon. Any time before we reach it you can get out, walk in any direction you like, and you won’t be in the game no more. Once we go through, you gotta retrace the route we took to get yourself back out that tunnel. That's when you’re home. And you gotta convince someone to take you back in a car coz I ain't ferrying you back 20 minutes in. You got till the tunnel to skip out on this, understand?

**AS:** I understand. Though I have to say I'm getting little nervous.

**ROB:** Ain't nothing wrong with a little nervous.

We've taken 23 turns by this point. Already I feel like we're traversing the city pretty effectively. Rob's heavily modified Wrangler solicits a few impressed glances from passersby, as well as several honks of respect from other Jeep drivers. Other than those few moments, everything seems completely indistinguishable from a regular morning drive. I even start to worry if there’ll be anything at all for this story. “Reporter Takes Drive With Interesting Man” isn’t exactly Pulitzer worthy.

Turn 33 leads us onto a short, unassuming street. A row of small businesses in a quiet Phoenician neighbourhood; liquor, second hand clothing, tools and, at the end of the street, a little shop selling antique mirrors. Ten or so people shuffle along the sidewalk, smiling, talking, planning their weekends. The only lone person is a young woman in a grey coat..

I briefly glimpse her at the end of the street, standing on our next corner, the back of her coat reflected in fifty old mirrors. Even from a distance I can see that she’s sullen, wide eyed and nervous. She shifts constantly on her feet, tugging at the button of her coat.

I look away to write some notes as we roll down the street. When I look up again, the woman is standing by my window, staring right at me. She’s smiling, a wide, unfaltering grin that seems almost offensive in its complete insincerity.

**GREYWOMAN:** Lambs at the gate. Hoping for something better than clover when all they find are things worse than slaughter.

**AS:** Rob what's happening?

**ROB:** Ignore her.

**GREYWOMAN:** He wanted to leave me so I cut him out. The lake was hungry it drank the wound clean.

**AS:** Miss, are you alright?

The smile vanishes, it snaps from her face and suddenly, the woman is furious.

**GREYWOMAN:** What do you think you're doing?! Have you gone mad?!

I reflexively press myself back in my chair as the woman, wild eyed and gaunt, slams her fists against my window, with every intent of breaking through.

**GREYWOMAN:** Would you dance down the lion’s tongue? It will shred you, you whore! It will shred you down to your sins! You fucking bastard!

Rob puts his foot down, and the Wrangler rolls defiantly away from the woman. As we turn the corner I watch her as she wretches, her every movement cradled in abject hysteria. She yells despairingly at the rest of the convoy, bursting into tears when the last car passes her by. 

As she shrinks into the rear view mirror, I see her turn to a large mirror on the side of the shop, which the owner is in the process of polishing. I watch as she walks up to it, and with a convulsant scream, slams her head into the glass.

The mirror cracks around her forehead, the owner jumps back in shock, and as the woman pulls her head from the mirror's surface, the fractured spider’s web is dripping red. It all happens in a split second, and she quickly swerves from my view as we take the next left.

**AS:** Rob, what was that?

**ROB:** She's there sometimes.

**AS:** On that street?

**ROB:** On the 34th turn.

**AS:** Who is she?

**ROB:** I don't know. She's never acted out that much before though. Must be a special trip.

I find Rob's lack of concern a little unpleasant, and his implication that this woman's ravings were the symptom of an internet game leaves me more than a little perturbed. As I see it, there are a few explanations for what just happened, and none of them lead to a comforting conclusion.

If we had just encountered a bonafide crazy person, then one could argue that Rob is just seeing what he wants to see. Maybe he'd bought into the game’s story so much that every strange but explainable occurrence would be rationalised as the next step in his favourite paranormal narrative.

Alternatively, the woman could have been an actor, a more elaborate theory sure, but not unheard of. People have lied to the show before and Rob was receiving a tonne of publicity for this attempt from Lilith, Eve and I. I admit, Rob didn't seem like a liar, but good liars never do.

There is a third alternative however. An alternative which, if you put logic aside, explains the all troubling little details that I couldn't help but notice. Because as strange as the grey woman was, isn't it stranger that no one on the street would react? I couldn't recall a single glance in her direction by anybody on the sidewalk. Perhaps that theory falls apart when you consider the shock on the mirror seller's face but, when I think about it, he only reacted once the mirror shattered, and even then, I feel like his attention was on the mirror itself.

The radio crackles.

**LILITH:** Lillith to Bristol. Sara... Eve got that on camera! Do you have audio?

**AS:** I think it picked her up.

**LILITH:** My god that was so weird. Can you send us the file when we stop? Can you ask Ferryman when we're stopping?

**AS:** When's our stopping point?

**ROB:** For them, in about 30 minutes. For you? Well, you tell me.

Rob turns off a busy street just before a large intersection, onto a much quieter stretch of two lane road. Ahead of us the road slopes downward, leading into an underpass, which disappears into darkness.

We'd arrived at the tunnel.

**AS:** What is this supposed to pass under?

**ROB:** Ain't supposed to pass under anything, it's just there.

**AS:** And if we weren't playing the game?

**ROB:** Then it won't show. The question is, are you playing the game or not?

Rob turns to me. It’s the first time he’s taken his eyes off the road since we started. He pulls the car to a slow stop at the mouth of the tunnel.

**ROB:** You get out now you can go wherever you wanna go, but through there you'll need a car to get yourself home and, like I said, mine ain't turnin round for a long while. You understand?

It’s a dramatic statement, but unsettlingly, it doesn’t feel like he’s attempting to dramatise. It feels like I’m having something genuinely asked of me. Am I ready for what’s to come? Do I accept the risks involved? Do I consent to be taken down this road, and the next road, and the next? Am I prepared to see this game through, real or otherwise, to its end?

**AS:** What are you waiting for?

Rob smiles, and turns back to the road. He picks up the CB radio holds down the button on the side. The microphone crackles.

**ROB:** This is Ferryman to all cars. Anyone want to step out then pull to the side now. Otherwise, stay in formation and have some supplies at hand. We got a long ways to go.

Much like the game I’m so tentatively playing, my view of Robert J. Guthard seems to change direction frequently. I’d heard all about his life, but I’m sure that I know him. I like the guy, but I’m not certain that I trust him. And though I admire his dedication to the Left/Right Game, I’m not sure I’ll like where it might lead us. Yet as he takes us into the tunnel, his face vanishing and reappearing under the dim sodium lights, I can that tell he expects this trip to be a major step in his already impressive story, and this time, for better or for worse, I’m along for the ride.",https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7asz8x/has_anyone_heard_of_the_leftright_game_part_1/,NeonTempo,2017-11-05 01:11:04,18033,nosleep

###Team SoloMid 1-3 Clutch Gaming    

To r/leagueoflegends: CG move on to the Semi-Finals and will face 100T next Sun at 12 PM PDT. FOX will face TL next Sat at 2 PM PDT.   

To r/all: Team SoloMid, the fan-favorite and historically the best team in North America, have been eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by a newcomer to the scene, Clutch Gaming. This year, the NA LCS moved to a franchising system (similar to ""real"" American sports leagues such as the NFL and NBA); Clutch Gaming is a new esports team created by the Houston Rockets. They picked up what was expected to be a middling roster and have now taken down the favorites to win the title in an unprecedented upset.

[OC] I watched and graded all of Messi’s 800 goals to determine their average quality (and distract myself from my breakup),"Leo Messi is the greatest footballer to ever live. He’s a technical wizard, a world-class passer, an alien goal scoring machine and a remarkably consistent performer. For almost two decades, he’s been banging in ridiculous goals at an absurd clip. Last year, shortly after the World Cup, he passed 800 career senior goals (for Argentina, Barcelona and PSG). 

To me, what separates Messi from someone like Ronaldo, or Haaland, or even Mbappe, (beyond the [playmaking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LTfVFNEXYE), which also takes him a level above) are the goals he scores out of absolutely nothing. The goals where he assesses the defense, decides no one can stop him, and singlehandedly (sometimes using a teammate or two) breaks down defenses consisting of grown men who are being paid handsome sums to stop him. 

Anecdotally, I felt (before doing this research) that Messi had scored many goals that no one else on the planet was or is capable of. He also scores an obscene number of goals that would be the career highlight for the vast majority of footballers — to Messi, it’s just another tally mark.

Anyways, maybe I’m having a manic episode, or maybe I’m just bored, but I decided to go through his (first) 800 goals, and try to categorize each one according to a subjective (but hopefully fair and transparent) rating system (1-5). Yes, this is an imperfect method. The goal: see if my perception of Messi’s goalscoring record matched reality. (I also couldn’t think of anything better to do to occupy my mind while I go through a breakup).

The results, are, as you’d expect, out of this world. If you ever do have a spare hour and forty-five minutes, the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IscGtF_A14A) I used as a resource is worth a watch. We really will never see anyone like him ever again.

OK, let’s get started. All goals I mention are titled by their # and the opponent, and have a YouTube link attached. If anyone is interested in looking at each and every grade, the whole spreadsheet is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQxlp2pHKdIMwKPzW7ImATBOttWJFJ6cC5DlLVC01qc7fc23U4frU1QMbHOY0--G_5YIbA2rUlgexxy/pubhtml).

**LEVEL ONE**

Not much to see here, just tap-ins or fluke goals. A 1 is a goal you or I could probably score. It’s the kind of goal that gets you the “tap-in merchant” title. Like this goal ([30 vs Gimnastic](https://youtu.be/IscGtF_A14A?si=Ds0zGqvzxI0tA4K3&t=299)) or this one ([556 vs Real Sociedad](https://youtu.be/IscGtF_A14A?si=ec7LH6mIn8z8PbCS&t=4550)). 

According to my judgement, only 63 of Messi’s 800 goals, or 7.8% were graded as 1s.

Penalty goals probably fall somewhere between a 1 and a 2, but for this exercise I decided to omit them from the ranking system. Out of his first 800 goals, I counted 110 penalty goals, or 13.75%. So combined, between tap-ins, flukes and penalties, thats about 20% of Messi’s goals.

**LEVEL TWO**

A 2 is a pure strikers finish, a goal that you’d expect a quality goal scorer to convert. Nothing fancy. These are the kind of goals that a Lewandowski or Haaland make their careers on. Like this goal ([592 vs Real Betis](https://youtu.be/IscGtF_A14A?si=Ch0_pxd6SvpfKxkB&t=4863)) or this goal ([241 v Valencia](https://youtu.be/IscGtF_A14A?si=gNlvXf9ajS6DfQE-&t=2014)) or this goal ([625 vs Girona](https://youtu.be/IscGtF_A14A?si=QLR5_zCSf4rnPebr&t=5133)). Messi is a clinical finisher, one of the very best, and if he only scored these kind of goals, he would still be a special, special player.

By my judgement, 296 of Messi’s 800 goals, or 37%, were 2s. This is the most common categorization, edging out the 3s. 

If you’re keeping track, before we move onto level 3, we’ve categorized roughly 57% of Messi’s goals as level one or two, including penalties. If we only count non-penalty goals, levels one and two comprise just over 52% of Messi’s goals.

**LEVEL THREE**

This is the quintessential, bread and butter Messi goal that makes him so special. How many times have we seen him break down a defender and, seemingly out of nothing, be one on one with the keeper? How many times have we seen him produce a singular piece of skill that leads to a goal? How many one touch wall pass combinations has he played to slice through defenses like they weren’t there? This is the kind of goal that makes Messi, Messi. 

Every goal from here on up would be featured prominently on 99.9% of players career highlight reel. We’re talking goals like [620 vs. Huesca](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKCj7EaMnrM) where Leo receives the ball in an unthreatening position, then proceeds to humiliate a defender and cleanly finish off the goal. We’re talking [685 vs Atletico Madrid](https://youtu.be/5DACmHDL6A4?si=42O5BeSvFkHnPggY&t=72), where he rides a tackle, plays a wall pass and tucks the finish away neatly. Creative, buttery control and cheeky chip in El Clasico ([199 vs Real Madrid](https://youtu.be/IscGtF_A14A?si=4H0Ja_yqX4PelLk4&t=1664)). High press pickpocket, go around 2 defenders and finish calmly ([19 vs Recreativo de Huelva](https://youtu.be/IscGtF_A14A?si=YW_nO0PhPXZrKydw&t=184)). 

Skin your man, play a one-two and bang the outside-the-box shot in off the post ([161 vs Almeria](https://youtu.be/IscGtF_A14A?si=VxKG6eXAiXeScubV&t=2992)). Pick the ball up at the half-way line, drive at and around the defense and finish neatly ([495 vs Eibar](https://youtu.be/IscGtF_A14A?si=J8WmpiNNHi0D7EmU&t=4080)). Embarrass the entire defense ([613 vs Villarreal](https://youtu.be/IscGtF_A14A?si=aas1Lis3L8WpYhbV&t=5035)). Cut inside at full speed and freeze the keeper ([548 vs Celta de Vigo](https://youtu.be/IscGtF_A14A?si=wOesdeaUji7CxXwq&t=4497)). Wriggle through the lines and bury the shot in the far corner ([15 vs Sevilla](https://youtu.be/IscGtF_A14A?si=Lvx_PHK5ChRxpIOA&t=142)). A physics-defying curler from outside the box ([116 vs Getafe](https://youtu.be/IscGtF_A14A?si=RN_zi7e1mbQoypna&t=958)). 

This is the level where Messi creates magic out of thin air. These are goals that very few footballers have ever been capable of scoring, and that none have been capable of scoring at such volume as Messi. After watching all of his goals, what’s really remarkable is how unremarkable goals like this become after watching literally hundreds of them. Even for someone like me that has followed pretty much Messi’s whole career, so many of these special goals were brand new (which was a wonderful experience). 

By my count, a whopping 232 of Messi’s 800 goals, or 29%, were 3s. If we’re only counting non-penalty goals, 3s are just under 37% of his goals. This was the second most common categorization, after the 2s.

**LEVEL FOUR**

This tier is where Messi goes from GOAT contender to the unquestionable greatest footballer to step foot on a pitch. These are goals which would be difficult to score on any pitch, under any circumstances, never mind against the best competition the world has to offer. If I ever scored a goal like this in my morning pickup league I might retire on the spot. 

These goals typically involve beating 2 or more defenders on the dribble ([83 v Malaga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmUWUdRcS2o), [319 vs Valladolid](https://youtu.be/IscGtF_A14A?si=oeeWDIhgbPhp7bz6&t=2648), [547 vs Celta de Vigo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4e5d0W9ETA), [368 vs Getafe](https://youtu.be/IscGtF_A14A?si=9b8S_Ll6bwWEgK8U&t=3053), and the 2-for-1 solo goal special with [234 and 235 vs Malaga](https://youtu.be/IscGtF_A14A?si=QmU_EdEFsbxPO4G8&t=1950)), an otherworldly piece of skill ([187 vs Arsenal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyWOYxonkC8)), a transcendent team passing sequence with Messi at the epicenter ([168 vs Real Sociedad](https://youtu.be/IscGtF_A14A?si=OaIkYuW6otq5bAut&t=1396)), or combination of the three ([335 vs Deportivo La Coruña](https://youtu.be/IscGtF_A14A?si=jQ6XQdRNqORdiGYT&t=2790)). Level four also includes most of Messi’s free kicks, which are almost uniformly spectacular. Some of his best include [508 vs USA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNO9TdGHw5Q), [665 vs Liverpool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KdJDPWskVk), and [298 vs Real Madrid](https://youtu.be/IscGtF_A14A?si=GLMYfPNfGxiYmtIf&t=2416).

The goal that Leo produces in [656 vs Real Betis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oT9kPvzYPhs) sends Ray Hudson into pentecostal tongues. Then theres [735 vs Athletic Club](https://youtu.be/IscGtF_A14A?si=xXFrbzIHjfh47y2f&t=5821), in which Messi retrieves the ball in his own half, runs past three defenders, uses a series of one touch passes to beat the rest of the defense, cuts past one more helpless defender and slots it home cooly. As much as we might try to describe the little genius, sometimes we are just lost for words ([126 v Real Zaragoza](https://youtu.be/IscGtF_A14A?si=fbGg-1GFxYdjFon-&t=1038)). After all, sometimes, you can only know magic when you see it yourself ([253 vs Sevilla](https://youtu.be/yIOb_fig1-g?si=u1He9jringCpanl8&t=37)).

There’s also the goals whose quality is only matched by their monumental importance, like the eerily similar goals Messi scored in 2014 [vs Iran](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMnGE-FcIqc) and 2022 [vs Mexico](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osdCpqcX6zM) to change the momentum for those Argentina teams (who both, of course, made the finals). Others include Leo’s Champions League Final clinching goal ([196 vs Manchester United](https://youtu.be/IscGtF_A14A?si=foNhHBV-4jA40ss7&t=1627)) and beautiful team counter-attack in extra time of the 2022 World Cup Final ([793 vs France](https://youtu.be/IscGtF_A14A?si=6eM0b6pqGBi-s6oE&t=6227)).

In total, I graded 94 of Messi’s 800 goals, or 11.75% as 4s. He has scored a comparable number of penalties to goals of this quality, which is, in a word, outrageous. If we don’t count penalties, 13.6% of his goals are on this level.

**LEVEL FIVE**

The only goals I gave 5s were: 
[ankara messi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlnHNi0hdO0)
[wonderful wonderful wonderful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWt_vG9_Ug)
[its a brilliant run from Messi, can he go all the waaaayyyyy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBaXSEkzAEE)
[waaaaahhh are you kidding me?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYMl8k-mlHo)
[here he is again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vxakpl2eD6Y)

These are all-time classic goals which don’t need much explaining. The Boateng goal is probably a level too high, but that goal was just such a bolt of lightning in the moment, and I remember watching it live and losing my mind, and this is my list, so its here. 

**Conclusions and notes**

First, a couple of notable performances (from the perspective of my metrics): first, Messi’s 2011 hat trick [vs Atletico Madrid](https://youtu.be/IscGtF_A14A?si=LSXSf-3DqchZPqDK&t=1736), which I graded out as a 4-4-3, and his 2014 hat trick [vs Sevilla](https://youtu.be/IscGtF_A14A?si=4wzd4siNgoHbmpbN&t=3412), which I graded out as a 4-3-4. Good stuff.

Anyways, what did we learn that we didn’t already know? Probably not much. I did confirm my hunch that Messi has a ridiculously high average level of difficulty on his goals. The average score that a non-penalty Messi goal received (a sample size of 690 goals) was 2.53, which means that his average goal was somewhere between a quality strikers finish and a goal that most can only dream of. As the average tells us, roughly HALF of Messi’s non-penalty goals are goals rated 3 or above. Absurd.

I also learned that there are few better ways to distract yourself during a breakup than to watch and grade a 2 hour long video of Messi goals. And that whatever happens in this life, we are all blessed to have grown up watching this special man grace the pitch.

Thanks for reading through the results of my week’s obsession. At the very least, I hope you got to relive some classic Messi screamers. Cheers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/164cea4/oc_i_watched_and_graded_all_of_messis_800_goals/,wetwetwet11,2023-08-29 13:16:33,16066,soccer

"I'm a resident of Kashmir, a state in India where the autonomy has been revoked, all communication has been cut off. Hear our voices, AMA!","You might have been hearing about Kashmir in r/worldnews articles showing the human right violation acts, the cause of arguments between India and Pakistan, it was in the news a few months ago when one Indian pilot plane crashed and burned there, etc. This territory has been disputed between India and Pakistan, and is one of (if not major) reason of tension between two countries. Well, I have been born and raised in Kashmir, and still live there (Right now, I'm somewhere in India studying).

# 

# A note: My answers are gonna be honest to the best of my knowledge, and I will try to represent what majority/entirety of Kashmiris think. This might not sit well with the folks of India and/or Pakistan. If you're either of the above, and my answers don't sit well with you, then I'm sorry, but it's true.

# The people of Kashmir have been cut off from the internet, cable TV and calling, essentially rendering the place back into dark ages. This event to suppress freedom of speech has been done by the Government of India.

# Pinned answer about the exodus of Pandits: (I'm tired of typing this in different comments) I condemn what happened, so does my family and my friends, and basically everyone I've met. I really don't know how to make this any more clear.

&#x200B;

About me: I'm a male, born in late 90's. I can't disclose much due to fear of my own safety, currently on an encrypted network (because I'm paranoid).

How long have I lived in Kashmir: My entire life. I'm from Srinagar, the summer capital of the state of Jammu & Kashmir, but right now studying in a college in another state to pursue a bachelor's degree (hence my access to the internet), I go back home twice in a year.

My answers are getting downvoted faster than I expected. You guys can find them buried deep inside question threads. I underestimated the amount of non-open minded Indians on Reddit. Just check for yourself, you'll find some Indians commenting on every single thread about how this is an attempt to gain sympathy. Holy fuck guys, get a life. And a heart.

 This is blowing up, and I really can't keep up with all the comments. Still I'll try to answer.

Due to there being lots of questions asked, if you feel like I won't be able to answer yours, you can DM me as well.

Final edit: Alright guys, I'm signing off. After receiving all the DM threats and name-calling, I've decided to call it a day.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/cp2j5k/im_a_resident_of_kashmir_a_state_in_india_where/,NoseLikeJoe,2019-08-12 02:18:03,15233,IAmA

"Lessons I learnt the long/hard way, so you don't have to.","*Update* Thank you for all the comments below. I've tried to include as many tips and fail safes you have mentioned, in this post. I do recommend people read the comments as I may have missed some.

Firstly, thank you to this excellent community my PC is now built and working (pics to come in another post). I thought here are some lessons I learnt in building the PC, researching and other bits I thought would be worth sharing, as a lot of this I never had even heard about. Some will be obvious and others less so. I should note, that I'm not a pro or someone who does this regularly, just someone who spent a while reading around, so feel free to correct/highlight any mistakes, and I'll try to update the post. The descriptions, aren't really meant to be a full lesson about each part and will be lacking a lot of detail, but are more a jumping board for further reading if anyone is interested. For full information on building a PC I highly recommend looking around on YouTube and other sources.

If I get anything wrong, please correct me and I'll update.

On Monitors:

1. If you are after 144Hz 1440p gaming, use a Display Port (DP) cable, not a HDMI, if you can. As you could be hampering your refresh rate, ([https://www.tomshardware.com/uk/features/displayport-vs-hdmi-better-for-gaming](https://www.tomshardware.com/uk/features/displayport-vs-hdmi-better-for-gaming))
*Update* Although you could be fine if you are using HDMI 2.1, see link for more details 
2. Freesync vs Gsync. For simplicity, both these technologies aim to match performance on screen with your GPU. Freesync works with Radeon, GSync with NVidia (although some Freesync monitors will be GSync compatible, likewise for the otherway around). It's complicated and due to changes in the standards over the years it can vary from monitor to monitor. Make sure to do research on the specific monitor you're wanting to get/have. If you are buying a new monitor keep this in mind. [https://www.viewsonic.com/library/entertainment/g-sync-vs-free-sync-explained](https://www.viewsonic.com/library/entertainment/g-sync-vs-free-sync-explained)
*Update*According to comments freesync monitors will almost always work with Nvidia. As always, do read around about it.
3. Windows by default is set to have a refresh rate of 60Hz, if you have a higher spec monitor you can change this to match your monitor in ""Advanced Display settings"".

RAM (All except point 1 was completely new to me)

1. 2 Sticks of 8GB Ram will perform better than 1 stick of 16GB Ram ([https://techguided.com/single-channel-vs-dual-channel-vs-quad-channel/](https://techguided.com/single-channel-vs-dual-channel-vs-quad-channel/)). Also when installing them, put them in the correct channels, check your Motherboard for details.
2. Your motherboard will prefer your dual channel RAM to be in specific slots. I had an issue where I couldn't get the maximum performance of my RAM which I had placed in slots 1 and 3, but the moment I put them in 2 and 4 it worked perfectly. Check your motherboard manual.
3. Enable XMP in Bios (This might also be called DOCP or A-XMP). This will vary between motherboards, but if you don't your 3200MHz ram is likely running a lot slower. In my build, XMP wouldn't work till I put the RAM in the correct channels, hope this saves someone the hours I spent finding this out ;) *Update* You can use Task manager to verify you have done this correctly.
3b. Someone pointed this out XMP may void your CPU's processor (https://community.amd.com/t5/processors/xmp-profile-ram-3200-mhz-and-amd-warranty-policy-for-ryzen/td-p/145798) (https://community.intel.com/t5/Processors/XMP-Warranty-void/td-p/1196241). If anyone knows any more, please message me directly so I can add the details. This was mentioned by someone in the comments and I would rather pass the information and ask you to do your own checking as well.
4. When picking RAM, frequency matters, but so does CAS Latency. You want high frequency but low CAS (CL) latency. I'd recommend doing more reading about it, if you want to know more I'd recommend doing some more reading, but the ""true latency"" can be calculated as TL = CL \* 2000/Freq. E.g. CL 18 3600Mhz Ram has a TL of 10ns.
*Update* Someone who actually knows what they are talking about found point (4) confusing if not perhaps misguided and I recommend you read their post here (https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/kis9r5/lessons_i_learnt_the_longhard_way_so_you_dont/ggtdudd?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
5. Ensure the speed of the RAM is compatible with the board you are looking to purchase (or visa versa).
6. Motherboards will have Qualified Vendor Lists, listing RAM they have tested and certified to work. This may be worth looking at. Just because your RAM isn't on the list doesn't mean it won't work, or won't overclock, it just means it hasn't been certified to, so do take this into consideration. (I found this in my build, while it was from Crucial and some Crucial RAM was on the QVL, mine wasn't. Thankfully it was fine.)

Motherboards

1. Newer processors (e.g. at time of writing many AMD motherboards require a bios update for the 5000 series AMD CPU) may require you to install a new BIOS before they can be detected. Not all motherboards can have their bios updated without a CPU installed.  When shopping for your motherboard looking to see if it does USB Bios flashback should be considered. This was completely new to me and glad I learnt it in time.\*Addition\* Newer motherboards don't require bios updates and so won't need this feature, though you will have to check.
2. Different mother boards are compatible with different CPUs, pick your CPU first
3. CPU coolers may need different mountings depending on the CPU. When picking your cooler keep this in mind, you may need to ensure there is an adaptor.
*Additions from the comments*
4. Not all mother boards have connectors for front IO USB-C. If this is important to you and part of your case, it's worth looking into.
5. Using an M.2 usually disables some of your SATA ports. If you are planning on using all your SATA ports, make sure to check to see if this happens and how it happens on your chosen mother board.
6. Some motherboards are built with Debug LEDs now that will help you diagnose problems.
7. If you are after RGB effects, ensure your motherboard is compatible with the effects you want to add. There are 5V and 12V headers, so make sure they match. I'd recommend looking into this more yourself, as I've likely vastly oversimplified. (https://rog.asus.com/forum/showthread.php?110272-What-do-5v-and-12v-RGB-cables-look-like-you-ask#:%7E:text=You%20can%20also%20see%20the,as%20shown%20on%20these%20photos)

CPU

1. Some CPU's have integrated graphics. If you don't want to buy a dedicated graphics card, you need to purchase one of these CPU's. You then plug your monitor into the motherboard.
2. CPU's have a Thermal Design Power, if you are not using the stock cooler read up on it (https://www.tomshardware.com/uk/reviews/tdp-thermal-design-power-definition,5764.html)

Component compatibility

1. Make sure all your components are compatible. PC Part Picker ([https://pcpartpicker.com/](https://pcpartpicker.com/)) is generally pretty good at this. If uncertain, this is a wonderful community to ask.

Power supply

1. PC Part Picker gives you a good idea as to how much power your system will need, if not check the graphics card you intend to buy. Not all machines need a 1000W behemoth. Picking the right one will save you money
2. Power supplies come with a rating standard e.g. Bronze+ etc..., this is basically their efficiency. ([https://www.tomshardware.com/uk/news/what-80-plus-levels-mean,36721.html](https://www.tomshardware.com/uk/news/what-80-plus-levels-mean,36721.html)). I think it's safe to suggest people should at least go for Bronze.
3. Make sure your PSU fits in your case. I bought an ATX PSU, then decided on the 011 Dynamic Mini case, only realise it needed a SFX (smaller) PSU. I ended up going for a different case. Likewise an SFX PSU may not have the cable length you need or fit as snuggly in an ATX case (source: comments section)
4. Look into the build quality of the PSU. A faulty PSU can cause serious issues down the line, so it is worth taking time look at PSU Tier lists and review. (Link provided by several commenters https://linustechtips.com/topic/1116640-psucultists-psu-tier-list/)

Tools (OP Note: I've only tried Ninite)

1. Ninite ([https://ninite.com/](https://ninite.com/)) Is an easy way to download all the basic programs one tends to install onto a fresh Windows install, without having to go to 10-15 websites. E.g. you can select to install Chrome, Zoom, Steam, OpenOffice all from one installer. If you keep the install, it can also be re-run to update all the software in one swoop.
2. Patch My PC (https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/patch_my_pc.html) Patches software on your PC (Thank you to the sys admin in the comments for this.)
3. Chocolatey (https://chocolatey.org/) A powerful command line way to install and upgrade software.


Storage

1. M2 drives can be SATA or NVMe, NVMe is faster. (M2 drives are generally plugged directly into the mother board, for anyone who until recently was using a hard disk drive and considered SSDs ""fancy"")
2. I highly recommend reading this comment (https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/kis9r5/lessons_i_learnt_the_longhard_way_so_you_dont/ggtn00w/?context=3) as it contains stuff I was unaware of.

Case

1. If your case has bottom intake or exhaust vents, don't put it directly on carpet, as it can block the air flow.  (Yup....I did need to be told this \^\_\^, my previous computer just didn't have any bottom intake, hell it hardly had any intake).
2. Make sure your mother board, PSU, GPU and all your components fit in the case. This is particularly worth noting if you are going for a micro ATX or a ITX case. Worth noting is to remember to include fans + GPU length, any additional length caused by radiators (if you water cool), the size of your CPU cooler (if you air cool)
*Additions from the comments*
3. When considering your case, if you are water cooling, ""Room for 2x 140mm fans does not always mean room for a radiator as well"". Make sure to double check the clearance. Measure twice buy once. 

Advice on building (Notes and horror stories from the comments)
1. Many new coolers come with pre-applied thermal paste. If yours doesn't don't forget to apply it, to the CPU (See videos by people with more experience/knowledge than me on what to do).
2. Remember your mother board I/O shield (advice from the comments about making sure to put it in before you install the motherboard, mine came with it attached).
3. Make sure the CPU is correctly installed before you clasp it down.
4. If your motherboard has two slots to install a GPU. One of them (normally the top) will provide better performance. Make sure to use the correct one.
5. Make sure your CPU cooler doesn't block a RAM slot. In making my PC the AMD wraith has a notch on one side with the AMD logo, thankfully I put the RAM in first, so I swiftly learnt that I had to rotate the cooler 180 degrees to get it to fit.
6. If you can avoid it, do not build your computer on carpet (and do not stand on carpet when building) and be aware of static when building. If this is your first build, do some reading around this. Wear a static bracelet and attach it to something grounded.
7. Remember if you have a dedicated graphics card. Plug your monitor into the graphics card, not the motherboard.
8. If you are installing fans, make sure they are in the correct direction.
9. When playing the radiator of your AIO (if you are using one) make sure part of it is higher than the pump (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbGomv195sk)
10. It's often worth the time to read the motherboard manual.
11. This may sound silly, but cables and the sockets on the PSU are often labelled. Be aware of this, it will help you in the build.

More subjective advice

1. I've been recommend by numerous people to go for Gold+ PSUs, with often being stated that while its more efficient, it will also be better made. Your budget may dictate otherwise. If you look through the comments you will frequently find the advice ""don't cheap out on the PSU and go for at least Gold""
2. For most users if your CPU comes with a stock cooler. It will be good enough. You can always change it later. If your planning to overclock, you likely know more than me, so feel free to ignore. *Update* According to the comments, AMD stock coolers tend to be considered good enough, Intel, not so much.
3. A LOT of people below have said ""Do not mix cables from different PSU manufacturers."" as they are not universal. I don't know anything about this, so do some additional reading if you are considering doing so. *Update* From further comments this is something to take serious. *Update* from further comments, the word of advice is ""Do your research before using cables not supplied with the PSU you are using.""

Further notes from the comments: Below are points I've read in the comments that might be worth drawing to people attention. Please read around the topic if it applies to you.
1. One person has said XMP causes their Oculus Rift to do weird things.

Hope this helps some people. 
*Addition* I recommend reading the comments, as many people have put in their own tips/horror stories ;)

Take care all and Merry Christmas.",https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/kis9r5/lessons_i_learnt_the_longhard_way_so_you_dont/,TabularConferta,2020-12-23 17:33:23,15191,buildapc

However, the whole time I was a little puzzled with how severe the reactions from Wall Street have been, especially this week. ""The company had more than 100% of its stock sold short! That's never happened before!"", you say. I know, I know, but that's [not actually not a new thing](https://www.forbes.com/2006/08/25/naked-shorts-global-links-cx_lm_0825naked.html?sh=f59ff078400b). A short squeeze, even one of this magnitude, should have squoze by now with GME up more than 10x in the span of weeks. Something is just not right. **I think there is something much, much bigger going on here. Something big enough to blow up the entire financial system.**

Here is my hypothesis: I think the hedge funds, clearing houses, and DTC executed a coordinated effort to put Game Stop out of business by conspiring to create a gargantuan number of counterfeit shares of GME, possibly 100-200% or more of the shares originally issued by Game Stop. In the process, they may have accidentally created a bomb that could blow up the entire system as we know it and we're seeing their efforts to cover this up unfold now. What is that bomb? **I believe retail investors may hold more than 100% of GME** (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company). This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.

For you to follow this argument, you need to go read the white paper [""Counterfeiting Stock 2.0""](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) so you understand how the hedge funds can create fake stock out of thin air and disguise it so it looks like real shares. They use these fake shares in [short attacks to drive the price of a company down until they put them into bankruptcy](https://seekingalpha-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/instablog/11442671-gerald-klein/3096735-anatomy-of-a-short-attack?amp_js_v=a6&amp_gsa=1&usqp=mq331AQHKAFQArABIA%3D%3D). This practice seems to be widespread among hedge funds that go short. There is even a term for it, ""strategic fails–to–deliver."" Counterfeiting shares is extremely illegal (similar level to counterfeiting money) but it's very difficult to prove and even getting the court to approve subpoenas because of the way the financial industry has stacked the deck against investigations.

This completely explains why so many levels of the financial system seem to be actively trying to get in the way of retail investors purchasing more GME. It's not just about a short squeeze, it's about their firms' very existence and their own personal freedom. We have the opportunity to put all these people in jail by proving that we own more than 100% of shares in existence.

There are are **71 million shares** of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via [13F filings](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme) that they own more than **102,000,000 shares** (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen). Now, I don't know the delay/variance on these ownership numbers, but I think there is a pretty solid argument that close to 100% of GME is owned by these firms, if not more.

Moreover, there are now more than 7 million people subscribed to r/wallstreetbets\~\~. I know lots of people here are sitting on a few hundred shares that they bought back when it was under $50. Some of us are even holding thousands. If the average number of shares owned by each subscriber is even close to 5-10, we have a very good shot at also owning a similarly enormous amount of GME.\~\~ **Even if the average was just 10 shares per legit subscriber, that puts the minimum retail position at about 30-50% of the entire company.**

GME has been on the NYSE threshold list for almost a month. We don't have January data yet, but I just analyzed the data from the [SEC's fails–to–deliver list for December](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) (all 65,871 lines of it) and looked up the number of shares that were likely counterfeit. For comparison, I did the same for a couple random tickers. Most companies have close to no shares not show up. Of those that do, it's a relatively small number of shares. For example, two random companies: Lowes ($LOW, \~$125B market cap) had 13,960 shares fail to be delivered at its highest point that month, Boston Beer Company ($SAM, $11.5B market cap) had 295 shares fail to be delivered.

How many shares of GME failed to deliver? **1,787,191.** As the white papers points out, the true number of counterfeit shares can be 20x this number. How bad do you think that number will be when we get the numbers for January? I'm willing to bet its many times that. Look at how that compares to other companies' stock:

[Histogram showing number of shares that weren't delivered in December \(x-axis\) vs the number of companies that fall into that bin \(y-axis\). GME is an extreme outlier.](https://preview.redd.it/g723jvyhine61.png?width=445&format=png&auto=webp&s=39bad6c47b428d364de36e9888de35b79572d1da)

I think this explains all the shenanigans going on the last few days. There is way too much counterfeit GME stock out there and DTC, the clearing houses, and the hedge funds are all in on it. That's why there has been such a coordinated effort to disrupt our ability to buy shares. **No real shares can be found** **and it's about to cause the system to fall apart.**

*TLDR; We probably own way more of GME than we think and that is freaking out Wall Street because it could prove they've been up to some extremely illegal shit and the whole system could implode as a result.*

EDIT 0: Looks like I truly belong on this sub. On the first version of this post I didn't read the file description properly and summed a cumulative distribution. My numbers were wrong, but I have updated the plot and post with the correct numbers.

EDIT 1: You should also note this is the distribution for NASDAQ tickers, not the entire NYSE. I doubt that the distribution trend is any different though.

EDIT 2: Evidence that Fannie May and Freddie Mac were killed in 2008 via short attacks using counterfeit shares: [report](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-09/s70809-407a.pdf). Exactly what I think they were trying to do to GME.

EDIT 3: A lot of people were hung up on the ""3 shares per wsb subscriber thing"". I know many accounts are bots, I was intentionally underestimating that number. I have adjusted to 10 shares per ""legit subscriber"" to reflect this without changing the total amount I think retail owns.

EDIT 4: What I'm seeing on Twitter makes me think I'm being interpreted a little too hyperbolically when I say ""Something big enough to blow up the entire financial system.**"" We're not going to go back to mud huts, people.** This could just be really disruptive for a short amount of time and cause a number of firms to face liquidity problems, possibly bankrupting some of them. Life will go on and I'm confident regulators and government will step in and protect people if necessary. Hopefully they pay more attention to enforcing securities laws going forward to prevent this from happening again.

"SLV is a complete scam, its a scalp trade set up by banks to screw over investors. Avoid it at all costs. The silver market is and has been rigged for years","WSB was never moving into silver. The media got the story wrong.

Think about who reads weekend financial news. Old people. The last time silver had a real short squeeze was in the 70s, and these people are now in their 70s. Who clicks on ads? Basically only old people. Dealers of gold and silver love to advertise, and media likes to make money through click-through revenue. Of course they are going to post all these stories of small unit silver selling out at dealers, they will get higher click through and sales kickbacks from the targeted ads on these articles.

If you are purchasing SLV thinking you are purchasing silver on the open market, you could not be more wrong. **Purchasing SLV is the best way for an investor to shoot themselves directly in the face.**

I have done some research on SLV and I have come to believe that it is essentially a vehicle for JPM and other banks to crush retail investors by manipulating the silver market.

So what are these games of manipulation that the banks have played?

**The general theme could be described as this: If banks hold the silver, the price is allowed to rise, but if you hold the silver, the price is forced to fall.**

Jeff Currie from Goldman had an interview on February 4th where he dismissed the idea of a silver short squeeze, and he had one line that was especially profound,

“In terms of thinking how are you going to create a squeeze, the shorts are the ETFs, the ETFs buy the physical, they turn around and sell on the COMEX.” – Jeff Currie of Goldman

This was shocking to holders of SLV, because SLV is a long-only silver ETF. They simply buy silver as inflows occur and keep that silver in a vault. They have no price risk, if the price of silver declines, it’s the investors who lose money, not the ETF itself, so there is no need to hedge by shorting on the COMEX. Further, their prospectus prohibits them from participating in the futures market at all. So how is the ETF shorting silver?

They aren’t. The iShares SLV ETF is not shorting silver, its custodian, JP Morgan is shorting silver. This is what Jeff Currie meant when he said the shorts are the ETFs. Moreover, he said it with a tone like this fact should be plainly obvious to all of the dumb retail investors. He truly meant what he said.

What is a custodian you ask? The custodian of the ETF is the entity that actually buys, sells, and stores the silver. All iShares does is market the ETF and collect the fees. When money comes in they notify their custodian and their custodian sends them an updated list of silver bars that are allocated to the ETF.

But no real open market purchases of silver are occurring. Instead, JPM (and a few sub custodian banks) accumulated a large amount of silver, segmented it off into LBMA vaults, and simply trade back and forth with the ETFs as they receive inflows. **Thus, ensuring that ETF inflows never actually impact the true open market trade of silver.** When the SLV receives inflows, JPM sells silver from the segmented off vaults, and then proceeds to short silver on the futures exchange. As the price drops, silver investors become disheartened and sell their SLV, thus selling the silver back to JPM at a lower price. It’s a continuous scalp trade that nets JPM and the banks billions in profits. Here’s a diagram to help you sort it out:

&#x200B;

[reduce, reuse, recycle](https://preview.redd.it/ewkug02chwo61.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=a424d1a61b93e9a37541cdf8ff19591a3df9fb88)

An even more clear admission that SLV doesn’t impact the real silver market came on February 3rd when it changed its prospectus to state that it might not be possible to acquire additional silver in the near future. What does this even mean? Why would it not be possible to acquire additional silver? As long as the ETF is willing to pay a higher price, more silver will be available to purchase. But if the ETF doesn’t participate in the real silver market, that’s actually not the case. What SLV was admitting here, was that the silver in the JPM segmented off vaults might run out, and that they refuse to bid up the price of silver in the open market. They will not purchase additional silver to accommodate inflows, beyond what JPM will allow them to.

The real issue here is that purchasing SLV doesn’t actually impact the market price of silver one bit. The price is determined completely separately on the futures exchange. SLV doesn’t purchase futures contracts and then take delivery of silver, it just uses JPM as a custodian who allocates more silver to their vault from an existing, controlled supply. This is an extremely strange phenomenon in markets, and its unnatural.

For example, when millions of people buy GME stock, it puts a direct bid under the price of the stock, causing the price to rise.

When millions of people put money into the USO oil ETF, that fund then purchases oil futures contracts directly, which puts a bid under the price of oil.

But when millions of people buy SLV, it does nothing at all to directly impact the price of silver. The price of silver is determined separately, and SLV is completely in the position of price taker.

So how do we know banks like JPM are shorting on the futures market whenever SLV experiences inflows? Well luckily for us the CFTC publishes the ‘bank participation report’ which shows exactly how banks are positioned on the futures market.

The chart below shows SLV YoY change in shares outstanding which are evidence of inflows and outflows to the ETF. The orange line is the net short position of all banks participating in the silver futures market. The series runs from April-2007 through February-2021. I use a 12M trailing avg of the banks’ net position to smooth out the awkward lumpiness caused by the fact that futures have 5 primary delivery months per year, and this causes cyclicality in the level of open interest depending on time of year.

https://preview.redd.it/2vpm42uehwo61.png?width=849&format=png&auto=webp&s=5feb48c0ce3ce1a2a55280e7ec2f79b8b7f33c0a

It is evident that as SLV experiences inflows, banks add to short positions on the COMEX, and as SLV experiences outflows they reduce these short positions. What’s also evident is that the short interest of the banks has grown over time, which is also why silver is ripe for a potential short squeeze, just not by using SLV.

One other thing that is evident, is that the trend of banks shorting when SLV receives inflows, is starting to break down. Specifically, beginning in the summer of 2020, as deliveries began to surge, the net short interest among banks has actually declined as SLV has experienced inflows. It’s likely one or more banks see the risk, and the writing on the wall and is trying to exit before a potential squeeze happens (having seen what happened with GME).

For further evidence of this theme of, “If banks hold the silver, the price is allowed to rise, but if you hold the silver, the price is forced to fall” look no further than the deliveries data itself,

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e6gnlo7ghwo61.png?width=869&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb6ff867907a4de54a27876835cad96ac00ad46e

You’ll notice that as long as futures investors didn’t actually want the silver to be delivered, the price of silver was allowed to rise, but whenever deliveries showed an uptick, the price would begin to fall once again. This is because the shorts know that they can decrease the price of all silver in the world by shorting on the COMEX, and then secure real physical silver from primary dealers to actually make delivery. Why pay a higher price to the dealers when you can simply add to shorts on the COMEX and push the price down, and then acquire the silver you need?

But just like the graph of the bank net short position, you’ll notice that this relationship started to break down in 2020, and the price has started to rise alongside deliveries. The short squeeze is underway, and the dam is about to break.

And lest you think I’m reaching with my accusations of price manipulation by JPM, why not just listen to what the department of Justice concluded?

https://preview.redd.it/fwjolfmhhwo61.png?width=877&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b1804172cace87c2fb285f1f13bad1d5dcef374

For JPM and the banks involved in the silver market, fines from regulators are just a cost of doing business. The only way to get banks to stop manipulating precious metals markets is to call the bluff, take delivery, and make them feel the losses of their short position.

SLV is by far the largest silver ETF in the world, with 600 million ounces of silver under its control, and its custodian was labeled a criminal enterprise for manipulation of silver markets. Why should silver investors ever put their money into a silver ETF where the entity that controls the silver is actively working against them, or at a minimum is a criminal enterprise?

And let me know if you see a trend in the custodial vaults of the other popular silver ETFs:

https://preview.redd.it/8kbb08xihwo61.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=7da347b06b44433082ab041d11f35d1563c8919a

Further exacerbating the lack of trust one should have in these ETFs, is the fact that they store the metal at the LBMA in London. Unlike the COMEX that has regular independent audits, the LBMA isn’t required to have independent audits, nor do independent audits occur. I’m not saying the silver isn’t there, but why not allow independent auditors in to provide more confidence?

So what are investors to do in a rigged game like this?

Well, there is currently one ETF that is outside this system, and which actually purchases silver on the open market as it receives inflows. That ETF is PSLV, from Sprott. Founded by Eric Sprott, a billionaire precious metals investor with a stake in nearly ever silver mine in the world, so you know his interests are aligned with the longs of the PSLV ETF (in desiring higher prices for silver via real price discovery). Further, PSLV buys its silver directly, it doesn’t have a separate entity doing the purchasing, it stores its silver at the Royal Canadian Mint rather than the LBMA, and it is independently audited. By purchasing the PSLV ETF, retail investors can actually acquire 1000oz bars and put a bid under the price of silver in the primary dealer marketplace. And if a premium occurs among primary dealers, deliveries will occur in the futures market.

This is what is starting to happen right now, a premium has developed among primary dealers, and deliveries on the COMEX have started to surge, while COMEX inventories have begun to decline. And this is happening after PSLV has added just 30 million ounces over 7 weeks (once the small contingent of silver squeezers realized SLV was a scam and started switching). Imagine what will happen if investors create 100 million ounces of demand.

Even a small portion of SLV investors switching to PSLV because **they realize the custodian of SLV is a criminal enterprise**, would create a massive groundswell of demand in the real physical silver market.

After the original silver squeeze posts went viral on WSB on 1/27, silver rose massively over the first 3 trading days following it. But on 1/31 a post was made about citadel being long SLV which got 74k upvotes (compared to only 15k on the original silver post). This lead to a fizzling in the momentum for the silver squeeze movement on WSB. However, given what I've explained here about how SLV is a complete scam meant to screw over investors, is it really that much of a surprise?

Additionally, that post about citadel showed them with $130m in SLV. That's only 0.04% of Citadel's AUM. Do you really think they were pushing silver because 0.04% of their AUM was in SLV? This post also didn't detail the fact that citadel also had short positions on SLV. That's what a market maker does. They have long and short positions in just about everything.

There are plenty of banks talking about a commodities super cycle, and a ‘green’ commodity super cycle where they upgrade metals like copper, but they never mention silver. Likely because banks have a massive net short position in silver.

Lets dig into the potential for a silver squeeze, starting with the silver market itself.

Silver is priced in the futures market, and its price is based on 1000oz commercial bars. A futures market allows buyers and sellers of a commodity to come to agreement on a price for a specific amount of that commodity at a specific date in the future. Most buyers in the futures market are speculators rather than entities who actually want to take delivery of the commodity. So once their contract date nears, they close out their contracts and ‘roll’ them over to a future date. Historically, only a tiny percentage of the longs take delivery, but the existence of this ability to take delivery is what gives these markets their legitimacy. If the right to take delivery didn’t exist, then the market wouldn’t be a true market for silver. Delivery is what keeps the price anchored to reality.

Industrial players and large-scale investors who want to acquire large amounts of physical silver don’t typically do it through the futures market. They instead use primary dealers who operate outside of the futures market, because taking delivery of futures is actually a massive pain in the ass. They only do it if they really have to. Deliveries only surge in the futures market when supply is so tight that silver from the primary dealers starts to be priced at a large premium to the futures price, thus incentivizing taking delivery. Despite setting the index price for the entire silver market, the futures exchange is really more of a supplier of last resort than a main player in the physical market.

Most shorts (the sellers) in the futures market also source their silver from sources outside of exchange warehouses for the occasional times they are called to deliver. The COMEX has an inventory of ‘registered’ silver that is effectively a big pile of silver that exists as a last resort source to meet delivery demand if supply ever gets very tight. But even as deliveries are made each month, you will typically see next to no movement among the registered silver because silver is still available to source from primary dealers.

So how have deliveries and registered ounces been trending recently?

Let’s take a quick look at the first quarter deliveries in 2021 compared to the first quarter in previous years:

https://preview.redd.it/u6vl4z3lhwo61.png?width=669&format=png&auto=webp&s=97d96e5ee4fcc5553bb267603f764a0378123dec

After adding in the 3.6 million ounces of open interest remaining in the current March contract (anyone holding this late in the month is taking delivery), 1Q 2021 would reach 78 million ounces delivered. This is a massive increase relative to previous years, and also an all-time record for Q1 from the data that I can find.

Even more stark, is the chart showing deliveries on a 12-month trailing basis (which I also showed earlier)

Note: You have to view this on an annual basis because the futures market has 5 main delivery months and 7 less active months, so using a shorter time frame would involve cutting out an unequal share of the 5 primary months depending on what time of year it is.

https://preview.redd.it/o4wjuwfmhwo61.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=03f45022e0f2d1702d5c3e0aaa2877a654ed884b

As you can see from the chart, starting in the month of April 2020, deliveries have gone completely parabolic. While silver doesn’t need deliveries to spike for a rally to occur, a spike in deliveries is the primary ingredient for a short squeeze. The 2001-2011 rally didn’t involve a short squeeze for example, so it ‘only’ caused silver to rise 10x. In the 2020s however, we have a fundamentals-based rally that is running headlong into a surge in deliveries that is extremely close to triggering a short squeeze.

In fact this is visible when looking at the chart of inventories at the COMEX.

https://preview.redd.it/9907dfnnhwo61.png?width=827&format=png&auto=webp&s=45d5859b4c8cd42a66118d62e6d1a97f2364d774

As you can see from the graph and the chart above, COMEX inventories are beginning to decline at a rapid pace. To explain a bit further, the ‘eligible’ category of COMEX is silver that has moved from registered status to delivered. It is called ‘eligible’ because even though the ownership of the silver has transferred to the entity who requested delivery, they haven’t taken it out of the warehouse. It is technically eligible become ‘registered’ if the owner decided to sell it. However, the fact that it is in the eligible category means that it would likely require higher silver prices for the owner to decide to sell.

The current path of silver in the futures market is that registered ounces are being delivered, they then become eligible, and entities are actually taking their eligible stocks out of COMEX warehouses and into the real physical world. This is a sign that the futures market is currently the silver supplier of last resort. And there are only 127 million ounces left in the registered category. 1/3 of an ounce, or roughly $10 worth of silver is left in the supply of last resort for every American. If just 1% of Americans purchased $1,000 worth of the PSLV ETF, it would be equivalent to 127 million ounces of silver, the entire registered inventory of the COMEX. That’s how tight this market is.

Right now we are sending most Americans a $1,400 check. If 1% of them converted it to silver through PSLV, this market could truly explode higher.

And lest you think this surge in deliveries is going to stop any time soon, just take a look at how the April contract’s open interest is trending at a record high level:

https://preview.redd.it/olei0ejphwo61.png?width=779&format=png&auto=webp&s=e53aa870cf012bdeff94fb0b9f4d07ab8127813f

It looks almost unreal. And keep in mind the other high points in this chart were records unto themselves. That light brown line was February 2021, and look how its deliveries compared to previous years:

https://preview.redd.it/llu9bzoqhwo61.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd538ecd2ad375f52aa20ae9932d3b795832f322

12 million ounces were delivered in the month of February 2021. A month that is not a primary delivery month, and which exceeded previous year’s February totals by a multiple of 4x. Open interest for February peaked at 8 million ounces, which means that an additional 4 million ounces were opened and delivered within the delivery window itself.

April’s open interest is currently at a level of 15 million ounces and rising. If it followed a similar pattern to February of intra-month deliveries being added, it could potentially see deliveries of over 20 million ounces. 20 million ounces in a non-active month would be completely unheard of and is more than most primary delivery months used to see.

Here’s what 20 million ounces delivered in April would look like compared to previous years:

https://preview.redd.it/n706c9yrhwo61.png?width=478&format=png&auto=webp&s=78c23017586291a4f7efc66a274c8f1c9a99b4f3

So just how tenuous is the situation that the shorts have put themselves in (yes CFTC, the shorts did this to themselves)? Well let’s look at the next active delivery month of May:

https://preview.redd.it/ppuloa0thwo61.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=680a8cfba0f920b008a6660f52f35d45d82557db

If a larger percentage than usual take delivery in May, there is easily enough open interest to cause a true run on silver. With 127 million ounces in the registered category, and 652 million ounces in the money, most of it from futures rather than options, the short interest as a % of the float is roughly 513%. Its simply a matter of whether the longs decide to call the bluff of the shorts.

No long contract holder wants to be left holding the last contract when the COMEX declares ‘force majeure’ and defaults on its delivery obligations. This means that they will be settled in cash rather than silver, and won’t get to participate in the further upside of the move right when its likely going parabolic. As registered inventories dwindle, longs are incentivized to take physical delivery just so that they can guarantee they will be able to remain long silver.

Of course, the COMEX could always prevent a default by simply allowing silver to continue trading higher. There is always silver available if the price is high enough. Like the situation with GameStop, the authorities have historically tended to interfere with the silver market during previous short squeezes where longs begin to take delivery in large quantities.

There were always shares of GME available to purchase, it’s just that the price had not reached what the longs were demanding quite yet. Given that it was the powerful connected elite of society who were short GME though, the trade was shut down and rigged against the millions of retail traders. The GME short squeeze may indeed continue, because in this situation it’s millions of small individuals holding GME. While they were able to temporarily prevent purchases of GME, they can’t force them to sell.

In the silver short squeeze of the 1970s, that’s exactly what the authorities forced the Hunt Brothers (the duo that orchestrated the squeeze) to do, they actually forced them to sell. The difference this time is that it’s not a squeeze orchestrated by a single entity, but rather millions of individuals who are purchasing a few ounces of silver each from around the globe. There is no collusion on the long side among a small group of actors like in the 70s with the Hunt brothers or when Warren Buffet squeezed silver in the late 90s, so there’s no basis to stop the squeeze.

In the squeeze of 1979-1980, the regulators literally pulled a ‘GameStop’ on the silver market. Or in reality, the more recent action with GameStop was regulators pulling a ‘silver’. The regulators will try everything in their power to prevent the squeeze from happening again, but this time it’s not two brothers and a couple of Saudi princes buying millions of ounces each (or just Warren Buffet on his own), but rather it’s millions of retail investors buying a few ounces each. There is no cornering the market going on. This is actual silver demand running headlong into a silver market that banks have irresponsibly shorted to such a level that they deserve the losses that hit them. They’ve been manipulating and toying with silver investors for decades and profiting off of illegal collusion. Bailing out the banks as their losses pile up would be truly reprehensible action by our government, and tacit admission that our government is ok with a few big banks on the short side stealing billions from small individual investors.

But what about beyond a short squeeze? Is there any logic to buying silver on a fundamentals basis?

There are two types of bull markets in silver. One is a fundamentals-based bull market, where silver is undervalued relative to industrial and monetary demand. The second type of silver bull market is a short squeeze. Both types of bull markets have occurred at different points in the past 60 years. However, the 1971-80 market in which the price of silver increased over 30x does was combination of both types of bull markets.

I believe we may be entering another silver bull market like the one that began in the fall of 1971, where both a short squeeze and fundamentals-based rally occur simultaneously.

Smoke alarms are ringing in the silver market, and are signaling another generational bull market.

So what are these ‘smoke alarms’?

I recently went digging through various data to try and quantify where we are in the silver bull/bear market cycle.

I ended up creating an indicator that I like to call SMOEC, pronounced ‘smoke’.

The components of the abbreviation come from the words Silver, Money supply, and Economy.

Lets look at the money supply relative to the economy, or GDP. More specifically, if you look at the chart below, you will see the ratio of M3 Money supply to nominal GDP, monthly, from 1960 through 2020.

https://preview.redd.it/ltu4vgovhwo61.png?width=852&format=png&auto=webp&s=de4f9f2f0748ca3d86e8cf153175efa78901435d

When this ratio is rising, it means that the broad money supply (M3) is increasing faster than the economy, and when it is falling it means that the economy is growing faster than the money supply.

One thing that is very important when investing in any asset class, is the valuation that you enter the market at. Silver is no different, but being a commodity rather than cash-flow producing asset, how does one value silver? It might not produce cash flows or pay dividends, but it does have a long history of being used as both money and as a monetary hedge, so this is the correct lense through which to examine the ‘valuation’ level of silver.

Enter the SMOEC indicator. The SMOEC indicator tells you when silver is generationally undervalued and sets off a ‘smoke alarm’ that is the signal to start buying. In other words, SMOEC is a signal telling you when silver is about to smoke it up and get super high.

Below, you will see a chart of the SMOEC indicator. SMOEC is calculated by dividing the monthly price of silver by the ratio shown above (M3/GDP).

More specifically it is: LN(Silver Price / (M3/Nominal GDP))

Below you will see a chart of the SMOEC level from January 1965 through March 2021.

https://preview.redd.it/5m8y7kzyhwo61.png?width=905&format=png&auto=webp&s=1073a6fa09e9b1151a162b79172d673af515fc93

I want to bring your attention to the blue long-term trendline for SMOEC, and how it can be used to help indicate when investing in silver is likely a good idea. Essentially, when growth in money supply is faster than growth of the economy, AND silver has been underinvested in as an asset class long enough, the SMOEC alarm is triggered as it hits this blue line.

Since 1965, SMOEC has only touched this trendline three times.

The first occurrence was in October 1971, where SMOEC bottomed at 0.79 and proceeded to increase 3.41 points over the next eight years to peak at 4.20 in February of 1980 (literally 420, I told you it was a sign silver was about to get high). Silver rose from $1.31 to $36.13, or a 2,658% gain using the end of month values (the daily close trough to peak was even greater). Over this same period, the S&P 500 returned only 67% with dividends reinvested. Silver, a metal with no cash flows, outperformed equities by a multiple of 40x over this period of 8.5 years (neither return is adjusted for inflation). This is partially due to the fact that the Hunt Brothers took delivery of so many contracts that it caused a short squeeze on top of the fundamentals-based rally.

The second time the SMOEC alarm was triggered was when SMOEC dropped to a ratio of 2.10 in November of 2001 and proceeded to increase 2.32 points over the next decade to peak at 4.42 in April of 2011. Silver rose from $4.14 to $48.60, an increase of over 1000%, and this was during a ‘lost decade’ for equities. The S&P 500 with dividends reinvested, returned only 41% in this 9.5-year period. Silver outperformed equities by a multiple of 24x (neither figure adjusted for inflation). There was no short squeeze involved in this bull market.

Over the long term, it would be expected that cash flow producing assets would outperform silver, but over specific 8-10 year periods of time, silver can outperform other asset classes by many multiples. And in a true hyperinflationary environment where currency collapse is occurring, silver drastically outperforms. Just look at the Venezuelan stock market during their recent currency collapse. Investors received gains in the millions of percentage points, but in real terms (inflation adjusted) they actually lost 94%. This is an example of a situation where silver would be a far better asset to own than equities.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ir5gcfv0iwo61.png?width=676&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e02b95d63beea8de9b7e067cc40655d7a59da16

I in no way think this is coming to the United States. I do think inflation will rise, and the value of the dollar will fall, but it will be nothing even close to a currency collapse. Fortunately for silver investors, a currency collapse isn’t necessary for silver to outperform equity returns by over 10x during the next decade.

Back to SMOEC though:

The third time the SMOEC alarm was triggered was very recently in April of 2020 when it hit a level of 2.91. Silver was priced at $14.96, at a time the money supply was and still is increasing at a historically high rate, combined with the previous decade’s massive underinvestment in Silver (coming off of the 2011 highs). Starting in April 2020, silver has since risen to a SMOEC level of 3.37 as of March 2021. Silver is 0.46 points into a rally that I think could mirror the 1970s and push silver’s SMOEC level up by over 3.4 points once again.

Remember that this indicator is on a LN scale, where each point is actually an exponential increase in the price of silver. Here is a chart to help you mentally digest what the price of silver would be at various SMOEC level and M3/GDP combinations. (LN scale because silver is nature’s money, so it just felt right)

The yellow highlighted box is where silver was in April of 2020 and the blue highlighted box is close to where it is as of March 2021.

https://preview.redd.it/af5yjg13iwo61.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=f34ac3ae181c742c4ab2dbf30f64ae82648d84ac

**An increase of 3.4 points from the bottom in in April of 2020 would mean a silver price of over $500 an ounce before this decade is out. And there’s really no reason it must stop there.**

The recent money supply growth has been extreme, and as the US government continues to implement modern monetary policy with massive debt driven deficits, it is expected that monetary expansion will continue. This is why bonds and have been selling off recently, and why yields are soaring. Long term treasuries just experienced their first bear market since 1980 (a drop of 20% or more). The 40-year bull market bond streak just ended. What was the situation like the last time bonds had a bear market? Massively higher inflation and precious metals prices.

https://preview.redd.it/0e9ncqp4iwo61.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=21a08435c70609ca534ca672815cc2095358ef5a

This inflation expectation is showing up in surging breakeven inflation rates. And this trend is showing very little sign of letting up, just look at the 5-year expected inflation rate:

https://preview.redd.it/esd1tzp5iwo61.png?width=618&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c26a1673a48f884c3e3cba23ef3d393cfc5eac9

Inflation expectations are rising because we are actually starting to put money into the hands of real people rather than simply adding to bank reserves through QE. Stimulus checks, higher unemployment benefits, child tax credit expansion, PPP grants, deferral of loan payments, and likely some outright debt forgiveness soon as well. Whether or not you agree with these programs is irrelevant. They are not funded by increased taxes, they are funded through debt and money creation financed by the fed. As structural unemployment remains high (low unemployment is a fed mandate), I don’t see these programs letting up, and in fact I would be betting that further social safety net expansion is on the way. The $1.9 trillion bill was just passed, and it’s rumored the upcoming ‘infrastructure’ bill is going to be between $3-4 trillion.

This is the trap that the fed finds itself in. Inflation expectations are pushing yields higher, but the nation’s debt levels (public and private) have expanded so much that raising rates would crush the nation fiscally through higher interest payments. Raising rates would also likely increase unemployment in the short run, during a time that unemployment is already high. So they won’t raise rates to stop inflation because the costs of doing so are more unpalatable than the inflation itself. They will keep short term rates at 0%, and begin to implement yield curve control where they put a cap on long term yields (as was done in the 1940s, the only other time debt levels were this high). So where does the air come out of this bubble, if the fed can’t raise rates at a time of expanding inflation? The value of the dollar. We will see a much lower dollar in terms of the goods it can buy, and likely in terms of other currencies as well (depending on how much money creation they perform).

The other problem with the fed’s policy of keeping rates low for extended durations of time (like has been the case since 2008), is that it actually breeds higher structural unemployment. In the short term, unemployment is impacted by interest rate shifts, but in the longer-term lower interest rates decrease the number of jobs available. Every company would like to fire as many people as possible to cut costs, and when they brag about creating jobs, know that the decision was never about jobs, but rather that jobs are a byproduct of expansion and are used as a bargaining chip to secure favorable tax credits and subsidies. Recently, the best way to get rid of workers is through automation.

Robotics and AI are advancing rapidly and can increasingly be used to completely replace workers. The debate every company has is whether its worth paying a worker $40k every year or buying a robot that costs $200k up front and $5k a year to do that job. The reason they would buy the robot is because after so many years, there comes a point where the company will have saved money by doing so, because it is only paying $5k a year in up-keep versus $40k a year in salary and benefits. The cost of buying the robot is that it likely requires financing to pay that high of a price up front. In this situation, at 10% interest rates, the breakeven point for buying the robot versus employing a human is roughly 8 years. At 2% interest rates though, the breakeven investment timeline for purchasing the robot is only 4 years.

The business environment is uncertain, and deciding to purchase a robot with the thought that it will pay off starting 8 years from now is much riskier than making a decision that will pay off starting only 4 years from now. This trade off between employing people versus robots and AI is only becoming clearer too. Inflation puts natural upward pressure on wages, governments are mandating higher minimum wages are costlier benefits as well. There’s also the rising cost of healthcare that employers provide as well. Meanwhile the costs of robotics and AI are plummeting. The equation is tipped evermore towards capital versus labor, and the fed exacerbates this trend by ensuring the cost of capital is as low as possible via low interest rates.

On top of the automation trend, low interest rates drive mergers and acquisitions which also drive higher structural unemployment. In an industry with 3 competitors, the trend for the last 40 years has been for one massive corporation to simply purchase its competitor and fire half the workers (you don’t need 2 accounting departments after all). How can one $50 billion corporation afford to borrow $45 billion to purchase its massive competitor? Because long term low interest rates allow it to borrow the money in a way that the interest payments are affordable. Lacking competitive pressures, the industry now stagnates in terms of innovation which hurts long term growth in both wages and employment. Of course, our absolutely spineless anti-trust enforcement is partially to blame for this issue as well.

The fed is keeping interest rates low over long periods of time to help fix unemployment, when in reality low interest rates exacerbate unemployment and income inequality (execs get higher pay when they do layoffs and when they acquire competitors). **The fed’s solution to the problem is contributing to making the problem larger, and they’ll keep giving us more of the solution until the problem is fixed.** And as structural unemployment continues, universal basic income and other social safety net policies will expand, funded by debt. Excess debt then further encourages the fed to keep interest rates low, because who wants to cut off benefits to people in need? And then low long term interest rates create more unemployment and more need for the safety nets. It’s a vicious cycle, but one that is extremely positive for the price of precious metals, especially silver.

And guess what expensive robotics, electric vehicles, satellites, rockets, medical imaging tech, solar panels, and a bevy of other fast-growing technologies utilize as an input? Silver. Silver’s industrial demand is driven by the fact that compared to other elements it is the best conductor of electricity, its highly reflective, and it extremely durable. So, encouraging more capital investment in these industries via green government mandates and via low interest rates only drives demand for silver further.

One might wonder how with high unemployment we can actually get inflation. Well government is more than replacing lost income so far, just take a look at how disposable income has trended during this time of high unemployment. It’s also notable that all of the political momentum is in the direction of increasing incomes through government programs even further.

https://preview.redd.it/mnfd5gr7iwo61.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=34c7b3ddfc9808b29e08bd7619d47d1f51f840fc

The spark of inflation is what ignites rallies in precious metals like silver, and these rallies typically extend far beyond what the inflation rates would justify on their own. This is because precious metals are insurance against fiat collapse. People don’t worry about fiat insurance when inflation is low, but when inflation rises it becomes very relevant at a time that there isn’t much capacity to satisfy the surge in demand for this insurance. Sure, inflation might only peak at 5% or 10% and while silver rises 100%, but if things spiral out of control its worth paying for silver even after a big rally, because the equities you hold aren’t going to be worth much in real terms if the wheels truly came off the wagon. The Venezuela example proves that fact, but even during the 1970s equities had negative real rates of return and the US never had hyperinflation, just high inflation.

During these times of higher inflation, holders of PMs aren’t necessarily expecting a fiat collapse, they just want 1%, 5%, or even 10% of their portfolio to be allocated to holding gold and silver as a hedge. During the 40-year bond bull market of decreasing inflation this portfolio allocation to precious metals lost favor, and virtually no one has it any longer. I can guarantee most people don’t even have the options of buying gold or silver in their 401ks, let alone actually owning any. A move back into having even a small precious metals allocation is what drives silver up by 30x or more.

**TLDR: SLV is a scam, as are basically all of the silver ETFs.**

If you do want to buy silver you'll buy physical when premiums are low, or PSLV.

A reminder, when a stock is on the SSR list, it can only be shorted on the upticks (i.e., when the stock is increasing in value). **This does not mean you cannot sell actual stock that you own,** but that means you have to actually own stock, **not just borrow someone else's**.

&#x200B;

This means, that if an institution wants to **deflate the price**, they have to **already own shares** and then **sell them**. Those betting against the stock would already own a lot of stock for this exact purpose (probably purchased when it was sub $100), with the hopes that they can **keep the price down until they can short it again the next day**. However that plan went down the drain once **GME hit the SSR limit as they need to make those shares last TWO days.**

&#x200B;

**Edit:** I pulled some of the regression trends for all the upswings today and they are BEAUTIFUL. All between 0.84 and 0.96. Its almost like it was a computer doing it...

&#x200B;

When you look at the data below, you can see that GME never goes above 70 on the RSI band ([Click Here to learn about RSI](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp)), meaning the **stock was never overbought.** Instead it just slowly rises to the 70 and then eases off (I'm sure a very expensive program does this).

&#x200B;

If it went too high, there is a risk it could rebound and drop the price, allowing short sellers to buy up cheap shares to refill their supply. GME hit the 70 mark 6 times today, but it only hit the 30 mark three, (ie oversold), since short sellers were just slowly selling shares as needed to keep the price flat and trying to not exhaust their supply.

&#x200B;

The only time it went outside this band was during the last 5 min when they tried to bring down the price, but you can see that corrected very quickly before the day ended, and it went right up to $260 the second the market closed!

**What I believe happened today was institutions bleeding dry the short sellers of their reserve shares so that tomorrow they will have a reduced ability to stop the rally.** Think of this as a Zergling rush before you storm the base.

**---------- Update: What a flat price does for 0DTE (zero days to expire) options**

Thanks u/zirdc for sending me the tweet below that talks a about how keeping the price flat is important to have full access to Friday's options!

\---------- **So what will happen today** **~~tomorrow~~**\*\*?\*\*

I think the same institution that got GME onto the SSR list today will try to do it again. They will get the stock down in premarket again and very quickly hit the 10% SSR. This would mean 3 full days of no shorting.

If this happens, it could be another 'slow day' of letting the shorts bleed the rest of their reserve stock, with probably the first push in the last hour or two to get as many of the options in the money before the market closes.

**Edit: since we were up 5% in premarket, this would suggest they are not looking to hit the SSR today and it will be pushing the stock as high as they can!**

&#x200B;

\---------- **TLDR**

**Today was intentionally a flat day to make short sellers bleed their reserve stock so they have less when the real gamma squeeze happens in the next day or two. Strap in for the ride** 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

**Stake:** Shares in GME 💎✋ since Jan 26

&#x200B;

\-------- **Bonus! SSR Data**

I noticed there was not a post that had all the days GME went on the SSR list, so I went through all the files and compiled it.

Edit: A few people asked to see what the price did the next day. I have added the column.

https://preview.redd.it/qc452d2tthm61.png?width=1308&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0fa67e8fe3680d4843f5563fa7c26ea5830cd6e

Interestingly, of all those days, yesterday was the only time the stock ended the day with a gain (+7%) . The only other time we were close to 0% was the day before we say 104% price increase the next day.

Ceiling Boxed. The MOASS is upon us. For real.,"Hello beautiful apes,

I have some things to share with you that I feel we need to internalize as a community. This is not hopium, and it is not FUD.

This is somewhere in the middle. Giving a realistic perspective on what's actually going on. And it is important that we grasp the severity of the real situation so no one gets trapped anymore.

And the real reason why MOASS is finally upon us. No hype baiting, no calls to action, no dates.

Just sharing my perspective with some strong opinions, speculation, a fun story, and some pictures of charts.

There are 3 sections.

**Section 1: Addressing today**

**Section 2: Story / Thought Experiment**

**Section 3: Review of charts with lessons learned.**

&#x200B;

Let's get into it.

&#x200B;

**Section 1: Addressing today**

I know today sucked. I'm mad that I was right. I was hoping it wouldn't be a rug pull. I was hoping the subtle call to action with a time sensitivity that came out of nowhere promising the moon if you do this **one thing**... would be true.

But we need to learn from this.

I posted 2 posts prior to this one saying to be skeptical about it.

But because neither post went with the narrative being spun, it didn't get any traction. I tried to warn to be cautious of the options trap.

My only thought was.. this looks too perfect. It has to be a trap.

Because MOASS will just fucking happen.. It won't be laid out on the charts. It won't be a subtle bread crumb that we find. It won't be predictable. Someone's not going to come out of nowhere and say ""GUYS LOOK AT THIS THING I FOUND IN THE CHART AND IT WILL HAPPEN ON THIS DAY AND ONLY THIS DAY BECAUSE XYZ""...

It will be a sudden violent shift up. It will be a fucking Tsunami that hits everyone by surprise. It will be an asteroid in the dark. A black hole that swallows the entire financial sector and there's not a damned thing they can do to stop it. And not a damned thing any one of us, neither individually nor collectively can do to make it happen any faster.

The only thing I as an individual investor can do to secure the investment that I believe in, is to buy, hold and make sure that share is in my fucking name by direct registering it. That's all. Nothing else.

Options.. somebody show me one law that states MM must hedge with **shares** which drives a gamma squeeze?

Someone show me a law that states the calls being exercised must be purchased on a **lit exchange**, and can **not** be a synthetic fake share that they internalized?

BY ALL MEANS if you want to buy calls, and exercise them.. Go for it. That is your right as an investor. Make your bets. And exercise your rights if you feel inclined.

But make sure those shares are DRS'd once you receive them. Because if you're exercising with the idea that it will create a gamma squeeze, that won't happen. Not when they control the whole system.

This whole game, the system of rules and regulations and agencies to protect investors and the media are all controlled by them. They are created by them, for them.

The call battle was lost today due to people trading options on emotions. Not logic.

They used emotions to bait people into buying calls and pulled the rug from under them.

*NONE OF THIS IS FINANCIAL ADVICE. I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR. I'M JUST AN IDIOT WHO PUSHES BUTTONS AND EATS CRAYONS AND WRITES IN CAPS SOMETIMES.*

If you're brand new to this game, this story will help you understand what's really going on behind the scenes and realize that the game is already won and there's nothing we can do except BUY, HODL and DRS.

&#x200B;

And here's why I believe that:

&#x200B;

**Section 2: Story / Thought experiment**

Let's imagine a group of con artists comes up with a game. A game that they designed to make themselves money.

In this game you have two teams.

The group of con artists, and the suckers.

In order for the con artists to make money, they need suckers to play the game.

Let's call this game ""The Long Con"".

A game that goes on forever as long as there is a sucker to play it.

The game is simple. The suckers give the con artists money. And the con artists pretend they took it fairly.

If some suckers realize it's rigged and move on, no big deal because as long as there are enough new suckers to entice, the game can literally be played forever.

This game must appear fair, else the sucker would not play it initially.

Why would you play a game that you know is rigged?

So the con artists devise rules and regulations and sets up traps for the suckers.

**What happens if the sucker figures out the game actually is rigged?**

Well the sucker might consider finding loopholes in the rules of the game to create a fair advantage. The sucker might realize that if they force the con artist to play by the rules set out, the sucker turns into a winner overnight.

So the con artists figure out that the suckers are on to them.

At this point, what is the most logical thing for the con artist team to do?

Change the fucking rules. Duh.

But they can't just completely change the rules because that is basically the con artist team admitting:

**""We're conning you, it's all a big sham, all of us are in on it""**

So instead they create confusing changes and block out access to data, and PRETEND to play fair so that the suckers continue to play the game.

They get their friends to dress up like the suckers to infiltrate and create confusion. They pay off the media to get the suckers to believe what they want them to believe. They play very sneaky so that they can still come out ahead.

The one advantage they have over the suckers is that the suckers don't yet realize the whole fucking thing is a sham. That the truth would be so mind blowing to the average sucker, it can't possibly be the truth.

If the average sucker realizes what's going on and tries to warn other suckers, the rest of them are so brainwashed to believe the game is real that they'll fight tooth and nail claiming the con artists must follow the fake rules which were created by the very same con artists...

Without this illusion, the con artists could never continue the game. This illusion is what allows them to gaslight everyone. It allows them to move in the shadows the way they do. It allows them to say one thing and do another.

People truly believe the con artists are at risk of things like ""punishment"" and ""fines"" and ""jail time"". And that's why the game can't possibly be rigged.

They keep this narrative going by paying people to take the fall every once in a while. If one of them gets too greedy, they hit them with a small fine as a slap on the wrist.

A joke.

*""Haha look we caught you. Pay $200 do not pass go. And be more careful next time. By the way, you wanna go play golf next weekend? This time we're taking YOUR private jet. Okay see you soon. Hey tell my goddaughter I love her for me.""*

If one of the con artists in the group decides to turn on them, this gives them the perfect opportunity to show the world how ""just"" the system is and throw the book at them. Of course the only reason is to save themselves. So that the system as a whole continues to thrive on baiting suckers. So the secret doesn't get out.

The truth behind these actions is to create a sense of trust within the game. Even if the suckers know the game is rigged to a degree, they still feel that at least some of the con artist team must be held accountable. And their portfolio is up $40k so they feel they've beaten the system.

It tells them: *""See suckers!! Look!! One of us fell down!! We DO bleed!! And some of you won! Keep playing the game. We're not ALL in on it, swear!!! ;)""*

But that random +$40k in a random sucker's account isn't ""beating the system"". It's a bribe.

It's hush money. Because in truth, the only way to win big at this game is to know that it is rigged. And if you're making money, you're not going to want to tell anyone how exactly you're doing it in fear of the algorithm changing on you. Because if everyone knows your strategy, it's not gonna work anymore because everyone's doing it.

So they'll let a few of the suckers win. In fact it's a business expense. It's an advertising cost. It draws more suckers in.

Because for every sucker who wins $40k, there's another sucker who lost $80k.

It's not a zero sum game. That is an illusion. If it were a zero sum game, the con artists wouldn't make any money. They'd just be exchanging and facilitating. Not hyping, baiting and rug pulling as active participants.

And so the con artists realize that the suckers decided to play smart. The suckers found a loophole in the rules and hold the con artists accountable. They shine a light on the fuckery and put the con artists in a bad spot with 3 choices.

&#x200B;

1. Play fair and lose big time.
2. Reveal that it's all a con.
3. Restructure and figure out a way to continue the con.

1 and 2 are out because if they play fair, they lose everything. And revealing it's a con sends them to prison or starts an uprising.

So for the con artist team, option number 3 is the most logical and obvious choice.

**Because** they own the systems and servers that the game runs on, and **because** they own the media outlets that spin the narratives where the majority of the suckers get their information from, and **because** they write the laws they *pretend* to follow, and **because** they themselves are the counter-parties that are allowed to work in secret and investigate themselves, and **because the suckers believe them,** they can appear to be losing when in fact they're winning.

What do you do when you own everything and your sucker is on to you?

If you can't shake their resolve. You can't change their minds. They know they caught you red handed. They're holding on and not letting go. Somehow they're still playing the game?

You use that to your advantage.

In many Martial Arts, you use your opponent's energy against them. If an enemy punches you, you can grab their arm and pull them in the direction of the punch and trip them up.

That's what the con artists decide to do.

They spin a narrative that they're fuk. They leave breadcrumbs for the suckers to find, and reveal a bit of the game that the suckers already figured out. They make everyone think the whole game is at risk over one thing when in reality it's not. Because the rules are fake, and they own the court.

The only thing at risk is everyone realizing how rigged the game is and take their ball and go home.

That is what they're actually afraid of.

So how can they use this to their advantage?

By drawing the game out longer than expected.

The suckers appear to be wise. They are a worthy opponent. The only thing the con artists can do in this situation is draw it out and make them weary. Not because they're fucked on this one glitch, but because this one glitch could show the world that everything is fake.

They plan to draw it out as long as they possibly can. Pretend they're losing and giving ground slowly. The suckers think ""YES! We're winning! They can't keep this up forever!! Because of the **rules**!!!"".

This keeps them at bay for a while. It makes them zen like. It makes the suckers complacent so they don't start an uprising. The suckers who caught on to the scam are finally at peace with waiting. And the rest of the suckers think it's a conspiracy.

Hopefully at some point the wise suckers will lose interest or morale. But the con artists know they won't. So instead they set up traps for the suckers. They use psychology to make them give up one thing in place of a promise of a better thing.

They make the game interesting. A game that you constantly lose at is no fun. So they let the suckers win every now and then. Every 90 days or so. Just to keep up appearances.

This is done so that the rest of the suckers continue playing the game.

The main problem is that the suckers are getting smarter, and starting to realize what's going on and did something they never expected. The pulled a move called DRS. This was put in place many years ago and they forgot to destroy it. They left it in so they could play for fun against each other but they never expected the suckers to use it.

So the con artists eventually realize the game is up. At the rate and speed the suckers are waking up, it's impossible to contain it forever.

At some point, they have to pay the suckers the money they're owed. They have to admit defeat on this one glitch, this one loophole, so that they can continue for generations to con everyone else.

But how do they do that when the suckers won't let go? The suckers know the true value. They aren't suckers anymore, they're acting like fucking **Apes**.

How can the con artists get rid of them?

What do you do if you've exhausted every avenue? If your game file is corrupt and there's no fixing it?

**You start a new game.**

You let the apes have what they want eventually, but then you devalue what they want so that you stay in control.

The con artists have to take the ball to a new court with a new currency and blame the apes for destroying the old one.

But the only way you'd be able to do this is **slowly**. You can't do it all at once because then no one's gonna play your new game. They'll play their own games. No one wants to play with a cheater. There's a reason aim bots are banned.

The only way to survive an explosion is to get away from the blast radius. And if it's a super nova, you'll need a LOT of time to get away from it.

If the blast goes off before you're able to get away safely, you're done.

So then now we see the true game being played here.

At this point it's anyone's game. The con artists can win if they get enough time. The apes can win if the explosion happens sooner than the con artists expect.

But since the apes only moves are to wait, DRS and spread the word, and the con artists control everything..

Certainly no other action the apes can do would be able to set off the explosion themselves.

The con artists know this and can use this by making the apes THINK that some other action can be done to win. And this action turns out to lower the ape's account holdings and raise the con artist's. They tell the apes to buy into a call option because ""**Look it hurts us!!**"" and then pull the rug.

Over. And over. And over. Slowly raising the floor to make the smart apes think they're winning and to deter any other suckers from joining in before they're able to start a new game.

Because one of the ways the con artist lose is if every sucker turned into an ape and DRS everything. It's best for the con artists to work together and keep that contained until the final rug pull.

I know this story is long, and seems bleak, but there is a third player we haven't mentioned yet.

One the con artists are terrified of the most.

The Chairman.

The Chairman is a rogue agent. A hybrid. He's educated on the con artist's tactics, but is not one of them. He has power according to the fake rules. And he knows the con artist tricks. He knows it's a game of politics, he knows it's all a ruse and he knows exactly how to force them to play fair.

And he has one chance to set off the explosion and beat the con artists at their own game.

The Chairman can only use his move once. And if he uses it at the wrong time or prematurely, it can fail and they'll devour him. But if he pulls it off, he will be a legend among the apes. And he will be the most powerful player in the game.

The Chairman knows the con artists are playing the long game. He knows if he gives them too much time, he won't be able to play his move. But he also needs time himself to make sure that the move is air tight. So that the move will work.

The players who were once suckers, are now apes. And the power will shift hands to the players if the Chairman pulls it off in time. The apes just have to be patient. Trust that the Chairman has a trick up his sleeve. And not fall for any of the con artist's traps.

For once the Chairman entered the game, the con artists knew they were truly fuk. And the only way they can buy enough time to make a new game, is if they get the apes to lose interest. And the only way to do that is to knock them out of the tree BEFORE the Chairman speaks.

And then once and for all, when The Chairman plays his hand, the Game will Stop.

Side note: If you thought the story was a bit tin foily, I invite you to read some of my previous DD. I can't link because I'm afraid automod will delete me lol

But click my profile, sort through top posts of all time and read the top 6 posts.

AND BY THE WAY... I was the first person to come to the conclusion that Gamestop had sleeper agents on the inside. BEFORE RC kicked all those guys off. I posted the theory in the Mall Creep Bets sub and got death threats over it. The mods even made me my own flair. ""Shitpost masquerading as DD"" because they're compromised.

I might not have gotten ALL the specifics on that theory but I was totally on to something. I speculated and turned out to be right. Just not in the exact way I thought.

And if all that DD is true, then what I'm saying now, although impossible to prove, just seems like the most logical conclusion.

If they allow for exemptions of rules, if they cellar box companies and the SEC knows and doesn't do shit, if the largest hedgefunds are allowed to collude to naked short and hide FTDs, if they're allowed to play zombie stocks without retail on a private side market, the only logical conclusion is that the whole fucking thing is a giant scam and these morons fucked up and got Ceiling Boxed.

**Section 3: Review of charts with lessons learned.**

With that story in mind..

Look at this chart for a second. Internalize it.

&#x200B;

[Rug pull.](https://preview.redd.it/sns1xiyo5f181.png?width=667&format=png&auto=webp&s=8125cf2fff9cab0397336f832c14e3b9e28cbf5f)

In the entirety of GME history, this to me is by far the worst drop.

*""Wait what do you mean... January was $500 to $40...""* you say?

I'm not talking about price action. I'm talking about strategy.

Let me explain..

&#x200B;

[January](https://preview.redd.it/fpx8ey4fge181.png?width=962&format=png&auto=webp&s=86a1b810cde664349a724c93ff2e5a08013f4470)

&#x200B;

This is a battle. You see the hedgies struggling to stay alive. This is the moment the suckers turned into apes. You can just feel their desperation in every candle. This is what it looks like when they're losing control. A bunch of run ups and a bunch of dips. Chaotic. It's a fucking mess.

It's not slow up then fast down. It's not a rug pull. It's something that caught them by surprise and they're desperately attempting to contain it.

When I look at this chart, I see:

[\*Insert deep fake of Kenny\*](https://i.redd.it/66w9h0sehe181.gif)

Now  let's look at February:

&#x200B;

[February](https://preview.redd.it/w5kiyljrhe181.png?width=1055&format=png&auto=webp&s=0870e886908d1a28fd139c21bee702cf2594cc17)

&#x200B;

Look at the difference. It's a jump up, but it's not chaotic. It's controlled in a channel. Like an impulse wave. Smooth transitions. You see this kind of thing on any stock. Jump up then correction and settle at mid point.

Hedgies expected apes to fold in the 30s/40s and they thought they won. Then the jump to $200 was them paying off their can kicking with the roll overs.

Apes had no fucking clue what was going on, they just knew shorts never covered and figured ""Oh it's back on, this must be MOASS"" and people jumped into calls again.

I think it was at THIS point, hedgies knew they were fuk. Because they never expected it to go this far. This is when they decided to change the rules.

They thought retail was dumb money and would have folded, and by the time they had to roll over their swaps and all that bullshit they did to can kick, they figured it would have been around 4 to 5 dollars and this jump from $40 to $200 would have been $5 to $25.

But instead, apes held. The suckers didn't fall for the tricks. The suckers forced the con artists to play by the rules. And the con artists finally realized at this point what was going on and the position they were truly in.

But the apes still didn't realize all the tricks the con artists had up their sleeves, and the con artists used this to their advantage.

Enter March:

[March](https://preview.redd.it/btyr5yr4jf181.png?width=1185&format=png&auto=webp&s=3329da46295df237ac656309ef524b43212498fd)

This I believe was a test. A controlled test. I don't believe they were at risk of ""being margin called"" because they're all fucking in on it. I think this was a test of a new system. A new strategy to create more suckers and a way to keep the game going just long enough to buy some time to start a new save file.

Selling calls on the way up, and buying them back from paper hands. Selling puts on the way back up and buying them back from paper hands. You better fucking believe they made bank off this.

This was not a move to shake paper hands from the share tree. Because nobody sold.

This was a move to fuck all the calls and the puts and keep the premiums.

They weren't hedging shit.

[Feb to March](https://preview.redd.it/hp6naerjke181.png?width=1287&format=png&auto=webp&s=183b1044f805745a68cdc4a3ceb228fa9ae05545)

Look how controlled this is.

How smoooooooth. The chart is so clearly in an up trend. You'd think ""Oh shit this is it!!!! MOASS"".

But nope.

&#x200B;

[Rug pull.](https://preview.redd.it/ptlr6ivoke181.png?width=1062&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd0200e509874411334507a6dee599596909dc19)

It was a success. The con artists figured out a new way to trap the suckers.

I remember the exact moment it dropped from $348.50 to $117.

I rolled my eyes and said ""Fuck you Kenny, this is short attack to catch all the stop losses and it's going back up"".

Which it was. And it did. But it never recovered from this dip. This was the last time we saw $348.50

We all thought they were being margin called and $350 is when shit gets real. When in reality, they want us to think that.

What's actually going on is they're setting up bull traps for options every 90 days and making bank and throwing all the idiosyncratic risk in the FTD warehouse. Hoping they'll never have to worry about it because they're planning on starting a new game.

And when I say ""they"" I don't mean just Shitadel, I mean all'em. Every last one of the short hedge funds and the DTCC, \*insert every other 3 and 4 letter named organization\* and SEC is allowing it because the SEC is just playing good cop bad cop until they can get away from the blast radius.

Laying bread crumbs for apes to find. Pretending they're at risk when realistically this is just an annoyance to them. This is a glitch in their matrix. A window to their fuckery market wide.

Yes they place bets between themselves and call those bets ""swaps"". Yes they have wars here and there among the whales. But at the end of the day they're all sitting behind the same table laughing about it like Monopoly.

You can owe a player trillions in Monopoly if you just keep playing the game and letting debt pile up and the banker keeps printing more money.

""*Okay you get another free pass. Just pay me a little bit of interest right now.*""

No one's really at risk because it's just pretend.

We are interrupting something bigger than just one stock

Enter RC:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mxud86cxlf181.png?width=1026&format=png&auto=webp&s=21df23903038bf91cf9e832204015c748c2afe87

&#x200B;

When RC did the share offering, he started it right before the rug pull was going to happen. He knew they're controlling it and letting it go up slowly and he lowered the price with the share offering before they got a chance to rug pull.

They figured ""*Okay cool we don't have to short this, he did it for us*"" and thought he was pulling an Adam. They thought this was good for them but they didn't realize how badly they fucked up by raising the price and making the rug pull cycle so obvious.

Instead of using that ammo to short it at the rug pull, they did this and spread it out longer.

https://preview.redd.it/s06w12etmf181.png?width=810&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c8157b5f162f04781dc3e3fea159714b6909b3a

They probably thought he was so stupid by doing that for them. Giving them more time.

This in August was also intentional. They just faked people out and broke some ankles.

You see the green dildo, you're thinking *""Okay this is it. Let's go!!! Buy calls and then buy puts because this bitch going up and straight down again.""*

Nope. Flatlined on both sides. Expectations were up or down, not sideways. It was a sideways fake-out and they made bank on the Theta decay of far OTM YOLOs.

Which leads us to right here and right now:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x5lhxzqknf181.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6385b55fed2a50b1c100ae849703cf12e4670ce

We're in the end game. Again.

But this time it's for real.

Time is running out on both sides of the fence.

Not because marge is calling, they don't give a fuck about that.

It's for a few reasons instead that we're now in the end game.

Apes are smart as FUCK right now and DRS is fucking working.

What I mean by ""working"" is that they're being boxed in.

Instead of Hedgies Cellar Boxing the suckers, the Apes Ceiling Boxed the con artists.

Forced their fake margins so tight that they can't hold out for too much longer without revealing the game is completely fucking rigged.

And that means they'll be pulling more desperate moves. Like infiltrating and telling everyone to buy options for a rug pull. And other various shit we've yet to see.

Hedgies running out of time before the game starts looking completely fake and their getaway plan fails. So they're speeding up their plans and making wilder volatility so that the options look enticing as Apes fall for the bait.

Chairman running out of time to make his move because hedgies are speeding up their plans because Apes Ceiling Boxed the hedgies.

It's a giant roller coaster of emotions and a series of events that intertwine which will make the most amazing movie you've ever seeen.

Hedgies fucked up by letting RC get that share offering in before the rug pull. It allowed him funds to develop what ever the fuck he's developing which will change the game entirely.

They thought ""*What the fuck is he gonna do with a billion dollars... Buy more games lol fuck off*""

There was no way to predict he would create a brand new stock market out of nowhere lmao how do you go from a game retailer to a crypto innovator?

And hedgies realize more and more people are catching on, and so what ever is going to happen is gonna happen soon. On both sides. The infinity war has begun.

Not because of options or swaps or rules or margin or what ever bullshit, but because the game is, was and always has been fake. And if they don't do something soon, the entire world will know it's fake.

I'll leave you with this..

Study the chart looking at it from this angle. We're always looking at a few bits at a time, scrolling sideways. When you look at it in separate pictures like this, you can see something is totally different about this rug pull. It's the most violent and intense since January.

June doesn't count since it was RC, not the hedgies.

Notice also how the August sideways fake-out looks just like February. It's controlled. Not losing grip or fighting margin.

Notice how the recent run up to 250 and then rug pull to 213 are more concentrated, violent and chaotic like January instead of slow angled runs with huge top wicks.

I believe MOASS is upon us. And I have absolutely no fucking clue what that means, what it'll look like or when the peak is, or what day it'll go above $1k or $10k or $100M. This is an unprecedented, never witnessed before event. It could be a huge pre market spike to $100k or it could be a violent 6 month struggle with crazy volatility. But I do know the show has finally begun and we're done with sideways trading.

Hedgies got more tricks. And RC gonna announce some shit. And the chart is gonna go nuts. Not on any specific day or week. It's going to be completely unpredictable. We could see $50 dollar days and $3k days and $100k days and $100M days and brokers might end up offering fractional option shares as part of their rug pull plan.

No one can tell you what's about to happen next.

The pictures tell the story better than I ever could.

&#x200B;

TL;DR Stop giving into hype. Buy your shit, DRS your shit, and let RC do his shit. It's gonna be fine.

*This post is not financial advice, it is wild speculation based on my highly medicated and retarded opinion and you should not listen to me.*

&#x200B;

Edit: I just got notified that this post is at #22 on r/all

Congrats you fuckers, you made this post go world wide and hedgies worst nightmare will come true. Remember, in the story, the only way for the con artists to lose before Chairman plays his hand is if everyone woke up all at once and DRS.

Not financial advice of course. Just a story.

&#x200B;

Edit 2:

I was invited to a Discord a few months ago and Criand and Gherk and pretty much every DD writer were in it and we'd randomly talk here and there. Never a real conversation, just you know random Discord shit.

And after this post blew up they kicked me out.

Take that for what it's worth.

Edit 3:

I gotta be honest that kind of hurt. Like I never called anyone out and specifically said they were shills. Sure I implied the possibility because everyone's possibly a shill over the internet LOL but... For some strange reason I thought some of those guys in the group were becoming my friends.

I don't have a lot of friends and I don't trust many people easily, and my trust goes away quickly when someone does something shady.

But these guys seemed really cool. And never had an issue with them and never said anything bad about them. But all of a sudden this post blows up and they kick me out.

So I'll just have to conclude either I'M a shill. Or all of them are shills. Whoever was pushing the options narrative REALLY hated this post enough to cellar box it with down votes, and to ban me from a server for absolutely no other reason. No warning, no ""Hey let's talk about it"", nothing.

I had expressed my concerns the whole week about options and they all fought me tooth and nail and I won every debate because at the end, they couldn't answer my questions properly and my prediction came true and theirs didn't.

So...I wasn't exactly saying it before but yeah in my opinion they're all shills now because of that.

Or I'm the shill. One or the other, can't be in between at this point.

Because the only other reason they'd kick me out is if they thought I was the shill.

But let me ask you one thing... Who's using their platform for self promo and who's not?

Who's got a YouTube video link in every post and who literally doesn't give a fuck and just spits the truth?

Who says things that end up not being true and moves the goal post, and who says things that seem wild and crazy but then end up being true?

Who makes money off the apes exposure and attention and who sits here for hours doing this for no reward?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/r0sji0/ceiling_boxed_the_moass_is_upon_us_for_real/,thabat,2021-11-24 06:13:16,19275,Superstonk
HOA wants me to build a shorter fence? Got it!,"I’m piggybacking off of the HOA trend going around here.

This story was relayed to me by one of my favorite professors over 5 years ago, so my apologies if the details are foggy or inaccurate.

My professor was a very, very private person, the sort of guy who would hesitate to tell you his favorite color if you hadn’t known him long enough. He had recently had an incredibly nosy couple move in next door and realized the flimsy four foot fence he had got for the dog wouldn’t keep out peeping eyes.

So he installed a fence. But instead of using a standard size, which he knew his neighbors would peer over, he built an 8 foot fence.

It wasn’t even a week before HOA was on his ass, threatening every fine they could and claiming he couldn’t have a fence over 6 feet tall. So, being a dutiful citizen, he called the fence company to uninstall said fence. 

While the fence was being taken down, he closely examined the HOA handbook on the precise definition of a fence.

He installed a new 6 foot fence that fit every single regulation, but with a 3 foot brick wall beneath it.

EDIT:

A lot of people are pointing out they’ve seen a story like this here or on Tumblr. I acknowledge karma farming is a major thing, but I am relaying the story as I heard it. 

I have plenty more from him, granted they don’t fit in this sub. He used them to illustrate points mostly, like one about the horrendous public transport of Galveston where he literally ran through people’s yards. 

I don’t know if his stories were true— honestly I bet many of them weren’t. But he was a real man. I’d share his name if I felt it was okay. 

He served Cuban coffee during office hours. We got a random sub toward the end of the semester because he had a triple bypass that he had told none of us about. 

Truthfully, I don’t know if he’s alive even, which was one of the reasons I wanted to share this. I have no way to make people believe that I am telling the truth, but if you look through the comments here, several people say they’ve heard of or even done similar things.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/w7jlgn/hoa_wants_me_to_build_a_shorter_fence_got_it/,Wabisabi_girl,2022-07-25 13:39:37,19193,MaliciousCompliance

"Gamma Squeeze? No guarantee, but THE CALL VOLUME INDICATES IT IS A DISTINCT POSSIBILITY. This will get downvoted but I don't care. LET'S FUCKING GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","\*\*\*EDIT 16\*\*\* Lots of comments and DMs.  I'll try to get to everyone.  I am no expert.  I just guessed right (so far).  But as we know in this ongoing GME saga, anything could happen tomorrow.  So far, the momentum has carried into AH.  We'll know a lot more pre-market.

\---

Not investment advice.  Not legal advice.  Not mental health advice.  Do your own due diligence.  Make your own decisions.  This is just speculation.

So far today (~~2:48pm EST~~ ~~3:03PM EST 3:17PM EST~~ 3:33PM EST), there have been ~~206.83k~~ ~~214.43K~~ ~~238.49K 250.0K~~ 266.33K calls purchased versus ~~173.48k~~ ~~180.96k~~ ~~196.02K~~ ~~204.27K~~ 212.55K puts purchased (a put/call ratio of ~~0.843~~ ~~0.822~~ ~~0.815~~ 0.798) \[edit8: which means the disparity gap of calls over puts is still getting larger by the minute\].  The volume was similar yesterday.   I am hoping most of these calls were purchased deep in the money (like I did yesterday as explained here: [I Bought Deep In-The-Money Calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mciozx/i_didnt_merely_buy_more_shares_today_i_bought/)).  3/26 $150c this morning opened at $2.60 and have been as high as $34.72.  I picked up a few more this morning.  MMs are certainly going to have to delta hedge those calls given the price action this week.  Besides the long side day-traders profit taking and ongoing short attacks (a 10% intra-day pullback from daily high is completely natural as the stock runs higher), we are on target to close above $175 (or at least get there AH).  If and when that happens, there will be an immense amount of delta hedging by the MMs since the stock was hovering in the $110s last night.  Although a gamma squeeze was unlikely when the stock was trading in the $200s (especially given the extremely high premiums), the shorts attack on the stock gave us an opportunity to load up on deeply discounted call options.  This is what happens when you artificially crash a price where market sentiment is the mirror opposite and without a negative catalyst.  That quick of a price drop absent a negative catalyst, and 9 times out of 10 you'll see a snap back to the VWAP.  Oh, and don't forget the day-trade short sellers who are going to have to buy out their short positions since they will not want to hold them overnight.  This thing could rocket into the $200s before week end.  If you look back at the VW chart, there was a big dip before the big squeeze.....

TL/DR: I'm not saying it will happen; but it is certainly a possibility.  And a 25-50% spike due to a gamma squeeze could trigger the *actual* squeeze.

\*\*\*EDIT 1\*\*\* Typos

\*\*\*EDIT 2\*\*\* I'll update the numbers and/or repost this once market closes to give the actual number of options volume contracts purchased and the ratio.

\*\*\*EDIT 3\*\*\* Updated figures.  A key is that the call volume outweighs the put volume (the put/call ratio is 0.842).  When the option activity is lopsided, MMs have to hedge long or short (depending on which whether the call or put volume is getting the bigger attention).

\*\*\*EDIT 4\*\*\* The $175C options are now in the money...  And, as updated above, the put/call ratio is increasing (now it is 0.815).

\*\*\*EDIT 5\*\*\* (3:08 PM EST) As per the typical playbook, here comes the day-trade short sellers doubling down in panic to try to reverse the momentum.  Volume is too high.  It won't work.  (IMHO)

\*\*\*EDIT 6\*\*\* (3:15 PM EST) The drop in the RSI from 70ish to 60ish shows the shorts are putting downward pressure.  But its weak pressure (moreso panicking day-traders on short side than coordinated HFs on the short side).  Updated figures above,  the put/call ratio keeps getting larger (i.e., more disparity of calls over puts).

\*\*\*EDIT 7\*\*\* (3:20 PM EST) Although the RSI dropped (indicating downward pressure on the price), the short-term MAC-D is still 1 point above the signal line, which indicates the momentum is still bullish (and the downward pressure on price is artificial and not reflective of true market sentiment).  You can just feel the tension building....

\*\*\*EDIT 8\*\*\* (3:28 PM EST) I've gotten some DMs about why I picked up the call options yesterday.  I explained my thoughts a bit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mciozx/i_didnt_merely_buy_more_shares_today_i_bought/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mcea8r/thoughts_on_todays_manufactured_price_action/).  We still need follow-through volume from the bulls tomorrow for the price to hold.  But by overattacking the stock (a stock that some people with big money want to see go up), they overdid it.  The stock behaved so abnormally to traditional technical analysis and indicators that I thought a bull run today would be a big possibility.  I just got the sense that a lot of people were hovering over the ""buy"" button waiting for the bottom.  A lot can still happen. Nothing is guaranteed.  I am just saying the *possibility* is there to follow the gamma squeezes in January and February.  If it does gamma squeeze, is this something that is going to start happening once a month?  Guess we will find out.  (Also, updated figures above.  The put/call ratio difference keeps growing).

~~\*\*\*EDIT 9\*\*\* (3:42 PM EST)~~ \*\*\*EDIT 14\*\*\*  Apologies to u/Whiskiz, but I am removing the link to the VW short squeeze based on some of the comments I have received.  I definitely do not want anyone to misinterpret anything I say or create false hope or expectation.  This is really a completely different situation, and a first of its kind.  I don't want anyone to misinterpret the VW chart as saying that is what I believe will happen here--it is unprecedented so the price action will be as well.  Link removed.

\*\*\*EDIT 10\*\*\* (3:51 PM EDT).  As u/Kourafas pointed out, it is ""EDT""  not ""EST"".  Fixed.  I'll update the call/put volume on market close.  In response to u/SquierrellyDave this is actual call/put volume. The data is courtesy of [www.trade-ideas.com](https://www.trade-ideas.com).   Also, I am not promising a date.  I am not promising a gamma squeeze.  I am not promising the price will go anywhere.  I've only been day trading for about a year.  I have a lot to learn.  Certainly not claiming to be an expert.

\*\*\*EDIT 11\*\*\* (4:01 PM EDT).  Updated with new numbers.  **Final numbers:  Call volume of 294.18K vs. put volume of 230.97K (a put/call ratio of 0.785).**  I'll need to dig (perhaps someone can help) to find out how many of the calls are in the money, almost in-the-money, or lotto tickets (e.g., $800).  The reason I think this is ripe for a gamma squeeze (which is NOT a short squeeze) is because the price was $115 this morning.  At that price, the $150,  $175 and $200 calls were way out of the money.  The further out of the money the calls are, the less likely the price will reach the strike price.  The less likely the price will reach the strike price, the less shares MMs need to purchase to hedge.  A gamma squeeze (which I believe is what caused the spikes in January and February) was not a possibility until the HFs over-attacked the price yesterday.

\*\*\*EDIT 12\*\*\* I was going to post this in a comment but adding an edit here for everyone.  This is in response to u/Idjek's question.

So a call/put option is a contract.  The contract gives you the right (but not the obligation) to purchase (call) or sell (put) shares at the strike price.  Most people who have in-the-money call options (which means the market price is higher than the strike price \[further simplified you are making money on the option\]) will sell them for a profit, or if they expire without being exercised they will be compensated at fair market value if the option holder does not have the cash on hand for it to be exercised.

A call option is the right to buy 100 shares at the strike price.  So if I purchased 3 $150 call options that expire tomorrow, that means even if the stock price is at $250, I have the right to purchase 300 shares at a price of $150.  That's still a big nut ($45K) which most people cannot afford.  Even if no one holding an in-the-money (profitable) call option executes the option tomorrow, the market makers still need to have enough stock on hand to deliver it just in case someone (or multiple people) does executes the option (contractual right) to purchase the stock at the strike price.

The theory behind a gamma squeeze is, when enough people load up on call options, the market makers have to acquire shares for the possibility that the call options are both in-the-money (profitable) and exercised (the holder exercises the option to purchase the 100 shares).

The other key is the disproportionate number of calls to puts.  If there are an even number of calls and puts, then the option activity itself is hedged (so the brokers and MMS are risk-neutral on the options).  Think of it like sports betting.  If heavy betting is coming in on one side, Vegas moves the odds to encourage betting on the other side and even-out the activity.  Rather than ""move the odds line"", the MMs have to buy/sell shares to be risk-neutral on the options activity.

The market makers usually buy and sell shares slowly throughout the day to keep up with the options volume--so they are hedging real-time and it doesn't really effect the stock price.  When there is a sudden heavy surge of call volume + a huge swing in the price upwards, that unexpected movement causes a sudden need for the MMs to acquire an abnormally larger number of shares.  If they did not already have them on hand, they need to acquire them to stay risk-neutral.   How many shares they buy/sell is probably all done by computers and algo formulas.

On a basic level, everyone would lose faith in the market if someone tried to exercise an in-the-money call option and the broker said: ""sorry, no shares available"" or ""sorry, I don't have them.""  The brokers MUST be in a position to deliver the shares (via the Market Makers) if a call option is exercised.

\*\*\*EDIT 13\*\*\* I've gotten a few comments about my analysis, etc.  This is all just a hunch based on experience and studying.  This is definately a rigged game, we all know that.  But studying and learning has helped me try to make money by tailing the whales.

Here are a few books that I highly, highly recommend:

(1) ""*A Complete Guide to Volume Price Analysis*"" by Anna Couling \[she explains the importance of volume and how it never lies.  Back in the days of pit traders, the traders use to ""sense"" the markets shifting and could coat-tail the shift to make money.  At the time they, had a number of words for it...but what they were really sensing was volume.""\]

(2) ""*The Ultimate Price Action Trading Guide*"" by Mangi Madang

(3) ""*Trading In the Zone*"" by Mark Douglas

There are also tons of videos online from people that know what they are doing.  You have to watch and study price action.  There is no shortcut to it.  I certainly am no expert.  But by studying charts and price action, it has helped me TIME my trades better, look to trade at support/resistance levels, wait for the volume to confirm a break-out, etc.

\*\*\*EDIT 15\*\*\* My data is based on the call volume (per trade-ideas, which is a stock screening platform I use).  I don't know what portion of the call volume is people (like me) who bought and are holding call options, or people who flipped them as the price went up.  Thanks to u/87CSD, here is some data on the actual option contract activity.

According to this page: [https://gme.crazyawesomecompany.com/](https://gme.crazyawesomecompany.com/)

March 26:

ITM calls = 14,418

OTM calls = 80,541

ITM puts = 6,879

OTM puts = 139,575

\*\*\*EDIT 17\*\*\* Courtesy of u/manifestingmoola2020, here is some additional information about today's options activity.  More info is always a good thing.

I was hoping this info would be useful. I dont think its all options activity based on your call/put ratio, but if you find this useful please feel free to share. This data is from a monthly chat service i pay for and i dont know how its accumulated.

Option flow data from today is as follows:

\*\*\*EDIT 18\*\*\* (3-26-201, 12:38 PM EDT)   Although I thought yesterday the conditions were ripe for a gamma squeeze, as I said, we needed bull momentum to continue into today. So the landscape--for now--has changed. Looks to me like $190 is where we consolidate, but I think we break out back up to the $200s soon. I still think we have a good chance to close above $225.  But the shorts will continue to attack at key support and resistance points to try to trigger panic and algo selling.  Since volume is low right now, we may be in for another short attack to try to break trend.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/md53li/gamma_squeeze_no_guarantee_but_the_call_volume/,txtrdr456,2021-03-25 23:36:07,18027,GME

# 0. Introduction

I always had doubts about the T-21 & T-35 price movement theories. How was it possible that all the different short funds line up their trades and FTDs neatly on just a few dates? Why would they choose to operate on a few critical cycles rather than spreading the buy in risk out over each month?

Despite not really understanding the T-21 stuff there was definitely something to it so I just figured I was too smooth for that one. Then the OG of DD u/Criand shared an earlier version of this plot:

&#x200B;

[GME Quarterly Price Movements And Equity Total Return Swaps](https://preview.redd.it/koz9i1gqaij71.png?width=2435&format=png&auto=webp&s=98a3e727cf365ba4c52701bdc15ea57e82fcad39)

Wow. Everything seemed to click. The cycles we are seeing come from derivatives settlement deadlines. They're predictable. And they get more violent each time.

What I want to do with this post is to pull together a bunch of info I've found that helped me understand the fuckery and describe it as clearly as I can. Then go on to show some new data I have that might point us towards when this *death-spiral-swaps-cycle* began.

Hedgies r fuk. After 8 months of this ride I like the stock more than ever.

# 1. Total Return SWAPs, unhinged greed and the upcoming Minsky Moment

This has been covered before in some detail but I'll go over the key info as simply as possible before getting into the more juicy stuff.

https://preview.redd.it/txid9jx3rij71.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af29b850c473ca59bb2e1c17ab4d667e24f86ce4

So a Total Return Swap (TRS) is agreed between two parties where *one side (Party A in the example) pays an ongoing fee to another party (Party B) in return for any change to the price of an underlying asset* (often an equity like GME). This gives exposure to the equity without ever having to own it and can be configured to go *both long and short*.

*Why would a fund bother to use swaps rather than borrowing to short sell as is typically understood as going short?*

***Loopholes and fuckery.***

Synthetic short positions in Swaps have the advantage of being poorly regulated, with lower margin requirements and are unreported in any real detail in public data.

Here is a post I made a while back where Prof. Michael Greenberger explains Total Return Swaps in relation to Gamestop and Archegos: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nwiuo5/total\_return\_swaps\_behind\_gamestop\_frenzy\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nwiuo5/total_return_swaps_behind_gamestop_frenzy_and/)

In the video the following points are particularly interesting:

* Total return swaps are the ***same financial instruments that led to the 2008 crash***
* After the Dodd-Frank regulations Total Return Swaps should be transparent to US regulators and should have capital and collateral requirements (*hint*: they're not)
* Margin should be collected twice per day (*hint*: it isn't)
* Wall Street found a way around Dodd Frank regulations by 'deguaranteeing' their foreign subsidiaries ***providing a loophole that*** ***allows them to operate Swaps deals offshore with zero regulation from US authorities***
* US investigators noticed that reported ***Swaps in the US were dwindling***, after months of investigation they discovered that ***US banks were moving their Swaps from the Wall Street facility to London, Japan, Berlin etc. and claiming that they are no longer US Swaps even if the deals were negotiated on Wall Street and then later assigned off-shore***
* When markets are going well thats when ***speculation takes off, and that's when we hit a*** [***Minsky Moment***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsky_moment) \- a sudden major collapse of asset values

So Prime brokers on Wall Street are financial terrorists who have gone right back to their usual antics after destroying the global economy in 2008. Using the exact same derivatives that fucked us in 2008. Circumventing the very rules that were put in place to protect the system from another 2008 event. And using tax payer bail out and stimulus money to fuel another bubble that's bigger than ever. A Minsky Moment must be around the corner.

*But what's the reason for such massive speculation on Swaps to point where their bad GME bets could shake the entire system to its core and liquidate any fund caught on the wrong side of the bet??*

***Leverage and Greed.***

Unlike with a usual short position margin requirements for Swaps can be pretty lax. Particularly if shifted offshore to avoid US regulation. Also for a fund that wants to gain exposure to a synthetic short asset the LIBOR fees have become ridiculously cheap since Covid. FED goes *brrrrrrrrr*:

&#x200B;

[1-Year LIBOR Rates](https://preview.redd.it/8bbb0dhz1jj71.jpg?width=2035&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=efdbb600c874ac6ef8eaed5c0d857c893f5d6a7a)

The fee to hold a Swaps contract with a broker is usually based off of the LIBOR rate plus an additional 'spread' rate to cover the prime broker admin costs. Over the last couple of years the LIBOR rate has collapsed from around 3% in 2019 to just 0.2% today in Aug 2021. No wonder the share borrow fees we see are so low when hedgefunds can get synthetic short exposure for next to nothing from their prime broker buddies.

*But what happens when their bets go bad and they're over leveraged to shit?*

***Prime Brokers bend over backwards to help them out.***

From the Credit Suisse report on the Archegos fiasco - [https://www.credit-suisse.com/media/assets/corporate/docs/about-us/investor-relations/financial-disclosures/results/csg-special-committee-bod-report-archegos.pdf](https://www.credit-suisse.com/media/assets/corporate/docs/about-us/investor-relations/financial-disclosures/results/csg-special-committee-bod-report-archegos.pdf):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yvtd621y4jj71.png?width=1317&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d55434cd91f619949e53db42d90d910b484888b

The report is long and dense with a ton of useful info. The above is a caption I picked out almost at random, there are many other passages like this. It shows that ***Archegos was breaching internal risk assessment checks consistently since July 2020 until they collapsed in March 2021 yet Credit Suisse simply gave them chance after chance***.

*But how does a Total Return Swap work in practice?*

I don't exactly know but I found some useful info and examples while searching. It's all rather opaque. That's probably by design. These financial instruments are meant to be so complicated the real world never bothers to stop and look at the greed and criminality. And *avoiding post 2008 regulation to get back to the same game that ended up destroying millions of lives around the world should be criminal*.

Here's a technical example for those that are interested but the details don't mater so much:

https://preview.redd.it/eyymdx526jj71.jpg?width=1079&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f01e421f732a3354846385fbbd8e4c33ffb0b70

What's interesting in this example is ***the reset dates are*** ***stated as being quarterly***. From what I can find this is most common. This means that Swaps only need to have intermediate settlements every quarter despite often being agreed for a minimum of 6 months up to 5 years or more. ***Quarterly swaps reset dates could be what is driving the cyclical GME price movements irrespective of any futures trading deadlines***.

This seems relevant to me because linking GME trading to futures contracts is not so easy. Futures trading is usually for commodities, currencies or sometimes ETFs. Futures contracts for single equities don't really exist as far as I can tell. Swaps deals or even options contracts are the equivalent of trading futures for equities like GME. Correct me in the comments if I'm wrong here.

# 2. Portfolio Swaps: why hold anything real when it can all be synthetic!

In the previous section we discussed the basics of Total Return Swaps and how they can be used as hidden short positions with increased leverage. An extension of this idea is the Portfolio Swap as described here:

https://preview.redd.it/opb37spx9jj71.png?width=1598&format=png&auto=webp&s=39b575902e3a1ebc518c946785fbd01675571de4

So Portfolio Swaps are simply wrappers around multiple Total Return Swap agreements that can be held by a prime broker. In this way multiple synthetic short positions can be packaged up into a single Portfolio Swap and held on a prime broker's books.

*What if multiple oversized synthetic short positions are packaged up into a Portfolio Swap and then hedged by a prime broker under the same contract reset deadlines?*

***Obvious meme-stock fuckery.***

https://preview.redd.it/1ubrs98jbjj71.jpg?width=1079&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4c059946baba01ea6a9ce7dc1ccd368e55022c8a

*No group of stock market tickers from varying sectors should correlate with each other consistently for 8 months.*

And this is an interesting nugget I found while researching. It comes from [https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/portfolio-swap](https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/portfolio-swap) where they discuss some example legalese around the term Portfolio Swap:

[\\""\[...\] does not reflect the leverage inherent in the Portfolio Strategy and Put Option exposure inherent in the Portfolio Swap\\""?!??](https://preview.redd.it/fcy4fo7edjj71.png?width=1926&format=png&auto=webp&s=659c77b4c7a2b6c6d3f0947d4a20d27c4c63ea3e)

What does a Put Option have to do with Portfolio Swaps? Why is Put Option exposure inherent to a Portfolio Swap? ***Is this what the deep out the money puts were for??***

I don't know about this. But it's interesting to me that in just a few examples of how lawyers might need to discuss portfolio swaps, mentioning that *""Put Option exposure \[is\] inherent in the Portfolio Swap""* stood out to me. Could be something, could be nothing.

[Edit: I added this figure to show the Archegos exposure double spike during the Jan GME sneeze and then another huge spike in the March run up. Shortly after the March run up they imploded in the largest ever recorded trading loss - over 10 Billion dolars https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List\_of\_trading\_losses](https://preview.redd.it/hhnoqi3zuoj71.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=fba5b3b0572eddf86885874f6d12013b5e86d1e6)

Given that it's been confirmed that Archegos collapsed in part due to GME Swaps exposure. And that we see these quarterly price moves across a bunch of meme-stocks. It seems likely to me that they were packaged up together at some point in a Portfolio Swap to hold bad debt for the shorts. But can we work out when this started happening?

# 3. The start of the SWAPs

Many of us know that GME and a bunch of meme stocks have been extremely highly correlated (moving together) throughout 2021. Here I set out to look into this more closely and try to work out when exactly it began.

First let's take a look at how highly correlated the different meme stocks are:

[Correlations between different meme stocks in 2021](https://preview.redd.it/kgqex8kyhjj71.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec7fd3b70644c5ecda69d24c28f51ecf58397b8d)

Here I performed correlations of GME and 5 other meme stocks using daily close data from Jan 15 2021 until Aug 15 2021. Any correlation above 0.5-0.6 is large and means that the stocks have been moving together consistently for more than 6 months.

I won't mention the other meme stocks directly to avoid the wrath of automod. But GME is most closely linked with movie stock, headphone stock and the express-thingy.

Now we can run another analysis called a rolling-correlation to see when the correlations began. All this means is that we look at 28-day windows of stock price data and see how much each meme stock correlates with GME. We then slide this 28-day window forward over time to see if the stocks were moving together more or less over different 28-day periods.

[Rolling correlation GME and other meme stocks since June 2020. Note: in the bottom plot all lines are rolling correlations between GME and the indicated meme stock.](https://preview.redd.it/k12y1yxomjj71.png?width=4503&format=png&auto=webp&s=a71d022d84c6d3e2600632f853afb58185e74215)

We see that before the start of 2021 GME did not correlate consistently with any of the other meme stocks. You can see this on the left side of the bottom plot with the wiggly lines that seem to move randomly with one another. Almost as soon as 2020 moved into 2021 all of these meme stocks started to move closely with GME (increasing correlation lines for all colors in early Jan). Since then GME has had consistently strong correlations with all the meme stocks for more than 6-months.

*This should not happen in a free market place with independent price movements.*

Sometimes the correlation drops for a brief period for one of the stocks but then gets back in sync with GME and the others.

So this data shows that all these selected meme stocks are moving together and have the same quarterly cycle. The major differences are in the extent of big price moves and some slightly delayed timings.

*Now we've seen that all the meme stocks move together could we do something ridiculous like predicting GME price purely from what has happened in the other meme stocks??*

***Yes. Yes we can.***

Here I built a linear model to predict GME price movements based on the other meme stock price movements. I don't want to bore everyone with all the details here. I'll give full details in the comments if anyone is interested.

https://preview.redd.it/m3np5kgrojj71.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b3dc7c2bc3680b0c208a58d989e87c2cdcfdaf2

In blue is the model prediction on more recent data that it had never seen before. We can see that the model actually predicts GME price pretty damn well! And the model is only using other meme stock price data to estimate GME price.

Let's zoom in to take a closer look:

https://preview.redd.it/pl5noko3pjj71.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b01da80ba37906d80caa3ab94d654ef8ae7af39

The major difference in the model prediction is that we are over estimating the share price. But the actual trend and fluctuations are very similar. This might suggest that GME price was being suppressed even more than it previously was since the June run up, possibly due to the share offering around this time. Alternatively it could be that the other meme stocks got a bigger bounce than earlier in the year.

After accounting for the model estimating a higher price (mean centring the data) we get a model score of:

R\^2 = 0.73

73% of GME price fluctuations (variance) can be predicted just by looking at the other meme stock prices!!!

This is not something that should happen in normal circumstances.

https://preview.redd.it/di7t5tn0qjj71.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d847f9b48c869f84c6e1677b2f195a2ccc5e5a3

And the above plot converts the data back from log units to dollars. The model predicts that at the June run up GME should've spiked to $400 based on what happened to the other meme-stocks.

This could just be a modelling error. Or perhaps the price reached such danger levels with GME it was suppressed hard while the other stocks were allowed to ride higher.

https://preview.redd.it/xpj1hfyvpjj71.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&s=36e768e4807080fafffeac1724d53f6c8b20fac1

Finally this scatter plot shows how well we can predict GME data just by looking at the other meme stocks.

In summary of this section:

* GME and other 'meme' stocks begin to ***correlate together consistently at the very start of 2021***
* It's possible that these stocks were ***packaged up in Portfolio Swaps***, either one huge toxic bundle or multiple bundles that most commonly contain these meme stocks
* The meme stocks move so consistently together that ***you can predict GME simply by looking at the others - this should not be possible!!***

# Conclusion / TL;DR

To start we took a brief look at Swaps. Archegos was confirmed to have blown up in part due to GME swap exposure. Wall Street has been side stepping regulations setup to protect us after 2008 by moving swaps offshore and out of reach of US regulators. Portfolio swaps could be used to package up a bunch of bad short positions in the meme stocks.

To test the hypothesis that meme stocks were packaged up into swaps at some previous date I ran a correlation analysis. All meme stocks tested started moving with GME at the exact same time - very early 2021. Did a new rule come into effect or some other event on Jan 1st 2021? Perhaps they were all squeezing in Jan and then shifted into SWAPS at the same time we saw the options fuckery? Are the price movements of the last 6 months driven by prime broker hedging of Portfolio Swaps and contract reset dates?

Shorts are fukd. The *death-spiral-swaps-cycle* might've begun in early Jan but there's no way out for them. Apes hold. I like the stock.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/pbibrk/the_start_of_the_swaps_packaging_meme_stocks_up/,broccaaa,2021-08-26 00:22:13,17924,Superstonk

Sup, honorable apecitizens! Recently I’ve been working on this fascinating piece of TA, and now I am finally ready to share that with [you](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/msv8n1/tbh_i_only_trust_retards/). I am so confident in it, that I dared to put my beard (which I have for five years already) on the line! Worth your full read, I promise! I decided to structure the analysis in the following way: first we'll take a look at the VW short squeeze, revisiting its origins and background as the very first step of the discussion - in order to better understand the fundamental context of TA; after that I'll lay down the main technical parameters and frameworks, through which the [GMESS](https://imgur.com/a/Sd4uE1b) thesis will be dissected, applying all of those to VWSS and explaining the TA core on the Volkswagen example; then, the process will be repeated, but this time TSLASS anatomy will be elaborated upon. Finally, all of the data accumulated in the process, as well as the major findings made, will be applied to the current technical state of GME, in order to construct at least a potential forecast and the probable price action. Buckle up and eat a crayon, let's start.

Oh, and one more thing! I really encourage you to dive deep into the ANALysis with me, because the thesis can only be understood if all of the technical factors at play are considered in the sharpest detail first - and then in the aggregate: zooming out and looking at the bigger picture through the prism of coincidences, interdependences and probabilities. Dafaq did I just write? - Dunno, but that's exactly what I meant!

# Volkswagen - Das Short-Squeeze: Sep 2007 - Mar 2009

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Remember, when VW became the most valued company in the world for a brief wild period of trading? I bet, Pepperidge apes remember. The squeeze played out right in the midst of the global financial crisis, and such an occurrence was fueled by a curious background scenario, orchestrated largely by one very interesting person. Back then, the former President of Porsche, Wendelin Wiedeking (must be a cousin of Battlefield Counterstrike), was pursuing a goal of taking over Volkswagen. In this process, he used cash-settled options to circumvent the transparency and disclosure of Porsche’s market operations. While being acquired by Porsche, Volkswagen had its ordinary shares premium risen to disproportionately high levels compared to its preference shares.

As the general public was finding out about Wendysking’s takeover plan, hedge funds and particularly short-sellers set their eyes on the fact that Volkswagen’s preferred shares were traded at a significant discount to the ordinaries (approximately 70%). While the price of the ordinary stock gradually increased, the preferential shares stayed put - and the hedge funds smelt an arbitrage opportunity. They started shorting the stock and buying the preferred shares to profit on the massive divergence. For a moment, there was no news of Porsche continuing its purchase of VW ordinaries from the market, and that fact gave the hedge funds additional confidence. Only to get blindsided, as it turned out later. One shorts-frying weekend, Porsche announced its total holding in VW, cornering the substantial part of the float, and leaving only 6% in free float. In the meantime, short sales had risen to 12% of total stock outstanding. When the market found out that Porsche had acquired 74.1% of the outstanding shares through the in-transparent cash-settled options, VWSS happened - briefly making Volkswagen the largest company in the world, and finally allowing the shorting side to [GUH](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpnzup/i_recorded_todays_marketopen_and_the_instant/):

&#x200B;

>It was mathematically impossible for every short-seller to buy a share, and therefore close their position. In other words, half the room were going to be left in a burning building with no way out. A panicked dash for the exit began.

&#x200B;

— A spot on metaphor by Jamie Powell, an FT journalist. Hedge funds are estimated to have lost $20 to $30 billion by betting against VW ordinary stock.

What is really ironic (in Palpatine voice) - even though Porsche managed to burn many short sellers, the company couldn’t pay up for the huge positions it had created, and ended up being acquired by VW instead.

Also, interestingly enough, after his departure from Porsche, Wiedeking was charged with market manipulation for his role in the takeover bid. The charges were dropped in July 2016 due to a too little chance of success. Lucking Fegend.

&#x200B;

**Now let’s take a look at how this epic event was incorporated into the chart:**

[VWSS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/d3pfzvb202z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e497ddf6518faec188269120c44df64ab6cb1791)

Even though it all looks overwhelming from the first glance, don't worry, I'll explain. There are only two major TA instruments used here, namely Fibonacci retracement 🌈tool (useful for assessing 'altitude' and the crucial support/resistance levels, check out the in-depth explanation of this TA tool [in my other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mwevzz/the_big_short_20_why_bears_may_soon_reconsider/)). The second one is the trend based Fibonacci extension for time periods (pink vertical grid with numbers 0, 0.382, 0.618 and so on) - for setting the major time landmarks and zones. Furthermore, you should have noticed the three catchy geometric figures, and the purple line - which is actually a good starting point to unfold the technical thesis.

In the process of working with VW, TSLA and GME charts, I managed to identify several peculiar characteristics and patterns, that were of an evident nature and have been manifested on all of the three charts, to one degree or another. The most prominent one, in my opinion, is the killer purple resistance/support level. For the current VW example, it is somewhere around $30 mark, or $29.27 if you like precision.

One may observe on the chart above, that this level is indeed the most significant level through the complete history of VWSS. First, the preliminary to the squeeze major bull run, which solidly accelerated in the middle of September 2007, was held back and repulsed by this level's resistance on the last day of October. It took almost half a year for the price action to catch up to it again in late March 2008. This was followed by a consolidation (with several failed attempts of breakout) just below this level, which lasted for more than 100 days, before the price action finally torn the resistance apart with the powerful gap on the 16th of July '08. And guess what? Even after that, the level played the major supportive role for the price action, with one final retest before the squeeze finally lift off it in the middle of September 2008. You should also make a note of how the price was still magnetized by this level during the final stages of the squeeze. The signifficance of this price level for the whole chart of VW above is difficult to underestimate. Seeing the importance of this level and being a fan of Jimi Hendrix, I decided to name it ""**Purple Haze**"".

Let's inspect the fancy geometric shapes now. These are actually much more reasoned and circumspective than it may seem from the first glance. The first one, in orange, is a cup shaped consolidation (let it be called the ""**Squeezy Grail**"", because why not?) - taking place above 100% Fibo and just below the 'Purple Haze'  - which commenced as soon as this major resistance level had been tested for the first time. It is subsequently followed by the second consolidation of a flatter nature \[if you know what else is of a flatter nature, comment and if the joke is good enough I may give you an award\], which again plays around the main $30 level on the chart. The second consolidation, highlighted by the pink rectangle (a.k.a. the ""**Runway**""), is actually more important than the first one, because here is the point where the paramount breakout happens: the 'Purple Haze' resistance is blew off (in the middle of 0.382 period). Based on that observation, it is also appropriate to assume that in order for the squeeze to initiate, the 'Purple Haze' has to be conquered at some point inside 0.382 Fibo time zone, during the 'Runway' stage. Finally, the triangular ""**Squieezluminati Confirmed**"" part is self explanatory, imho. Oh, just one commentary worth being made here: take a look at how the squeeze itself is proportionate, bipartite, and fits well into the isosceles triangle. The nature surely knows how to play with stonks, too.

Especially, when we talk about Fibonacci. The horizontal 🌈 grid, Fibo retracement, is often used to estimate the possible corrective trend's depth, as well as to identify the key support and resistance levels of it. This one is comfortably applied to the beninging and the apex point of the trend (see the gray dash and dash line on the chart above), and its relevance is subsequently confirmed by how the price action plays around the levels in the triangle. The 12th of September '07 seems to be a good starting point for Fibo retracement application, because on that day another important resistance of $20.72 was penetrated for the first time (then confirmed as support with the beautiful bear trap candle on 23 Jan '08). Furthermore, $20.72 level works like an ideal 100% Fibo retrace level for the current example, and supports the 'Holy Grail' comparable to how my granny supports me. Also, take a note of the 'Purple Haze' being relatively in the middle, in between 78.6% and 100% of Fibo retracement - an important factor that will enable us to apply this retracement to GME later.

Not only the 12th of September fits well as Fibo retracement starting point, it is also a perfect spot to start stretching out the trend-based Fib time grid (TBFTG - to be fucked then go, alternatively). This one is a complex instrument, so take this quick explanation for granted or do your own research in relation to it. Just like Fibo retracement, TBFTG is based on Fibonacci sequence, but this one applies to time periods, instead of the price action and levels. In order to use this instrument properly, it is necessary to identify the preliminary major trend, that will serve as the core measurement for the sequent time periods. Oh, it took me a lot of time to inspect that parameter and to identify those initial pink dash and dash trends, trust me! Tbh, it was one of the most difficult tasks to accomplish in the preparation of this TA. But the result was worth the effort! I noticed the following correlation applicable to both VWSS and TSLASS (and hypothetically to GME too): TBFTG pink dash measurement must involve the major preliminary impulse of the prior main trend, plus 'Squeezy Grail' phase. The staring point of TBFTG is particularly tricky to be identified, and I'm talking about all of the examples, but possible - especially when looking at the TA as a whole, referring to how the grid applies to the price action, and comparing the examples between each other. That is pure rocket science, if you ask me. And most importantly, the TBFTG measurement duration (pink dash and dash trend) seem to be very similar in length to 'Squieezluminati' basis - check the bars measurements on all of the charts (blue lines for VW).

Pay attention to the following features, which really help to dissect the squeezes' anatomies and to build the suitable technical framework: *the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone; and the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, peaking at 1*; *TBFTG pink dash measurement includes major preliminary trend plus 'Squeezy Grail', as it has been mentioned above. Furthermore, the correlation in duration of TBFTG measurement and the triangle basis must once again be emphasized.*

Noice, but let's move further.

# Tesla, or how Elon Mask truly “is become meme, Destroyer of shorts”: Apr 2019 - Apr 2020

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Tesla and the founder Elon Musk have confronted the short sellers on a regular basis, and even after the run-ins with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for now, the former have been winning. The TSLA shorters were sitting on mark-to-market losses of over $40 billion in late 2020, as the company’s shares exploded 740% last year. This information is based on data collected by Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, a fin-anal company.

Remember the not so distant in past Tesla 'mania'? The prospects of Tesla’s business and the furious opposition of bulls and bears, including famous fund managers like David Einhorn and Mark Spiegel (who still hold a strong opinion that TSLA is a house of cards ready to collapse), have over the years contributed to an extreme volatility in the stock price. Elon Musk openly criticized the short-sellers and their motivation to dig out and spread negative sentiment about the company. The 'taking Tesla private' play seemed to work out for the short-sellers as the stock price collapsed by about 50% from November 2018 to May 2019. After that, amidst Tesla’s opening of the Shanghai Gigafactory and the announcement of the company's first annual operating profit exceeding analyst expectations, the tables have turned and the bear-beaten TSLA shares skyrocketed in price (not without noble WSBetters help, definitely). Needless to say, that previously steady short-sellers started getting anxious and scrambled to cover their positions.

&#x200B;

Dusaniwsky told Institutional Investor (B2B media) that shorting Tesla is:

>The longest unprofitable short I’ve ever seen!

&#x200B;

Well, Mr. Dusaniwsky, WSB seem to have an answer for everything:

https://preview.redd.it/h3l5hayu02z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecc69df97a282c4a22663e8487cf316488ed9d32

&#x200B;

While companies and founders often hold a scorn on short sellers, because they can bring down stock prices and cause the cost of capital to rise (or even do worse things, if you know what I mean), Musk’s disdain for the short selling community is unrivaled. In the middle of 2020, Musk took a dig at short sellers by releasing 'short shorts'. These now sell at a premium on Ebay. It's all nice and good, but I have another cool merch idea - '**shortz r fuk**':

[TSLASS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/f0qbrpqn22z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=479c78e6763043f81e9ac2c75cf8a6c769d9eee4)

&#x200B;

Beautiful, isn't it? Let's quickly run through the short squeeze anatomy checklist, thoroughly elaborated in the previous TA chapter via the example of VW. First things first, the 'Squeezy Grail' is present, but it resembles more of a V shape structure. Next, the 'Runway' stage is good-looking: a fucking massive gap happened there, and this time 78.6% Fibo level is tested during the 'Runway', being indicative of the TSLA bulls' crazy power. 'Squieezluminati Confirmed' is also really interesting here, as this time there is no isosceles triangle at its core structure, but rather a 'chainsaw'-like volatile price action taking place. Furthermore, you may see that inside of the triangle, there is the after-peak 78.6% Fibo zone retest, which in turn hedl and bounced the price back in the direction of... Moon. Blessed be the bulls!

Looking at the 'Purple Haze' (which is again in between Fibo 78.6% and 100% \[important!\]), for TSLASS the major price level manifested at $52.46. During the first half of 2019, this level played a role of a magnetizing support, with the subsequent testing in March and the breakout to the downside in late April. Again, a lengthy, half a year long consolidation is taking place just below this level, and above Fibo 100% retracement. The breakout occurs, you guessed, right in the TBFTG 0.382 zone. And what is really fascinating, is the fact that, after the breakout, the 'Purple Haze' has never been retested. But who knows what the future holds?

And the Fibos. The retracement, again, apples perfectly onto the complete squeeze structure: 78.6% is trialed several times; all of the upper levels except for 38.2% were broken with the subsequent retrace and and some with the retest. A particularly intensive price action was occurring for about two weeks near the 23.6% Fibo level, and the high of $189.4 level was penetrated and then touched gently during the initial squeeze. Ah, almost forgot, 100% ($35.75) Fibo level firmly holds the 'Squeezy Grail' in hand again.

Current TBFTG should be of an interest for fellow TAnaLyzators too. Particularly, the downtrend, as opposed to VW uptrend, serves as the core for TBFTG's application (again, refer to the dash and dash pinkish line). This core is composed of the pre-'Squeezy Grail' downtrend plus the Grail itself. Take a look at gray measurements, which cover this phase and the triangle duration - again these two follow the tendency of being proportionate in the length as phases. *Crucially, the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone again; then one more time the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, with the false first peak during the final stages of 0.618 and the proper peak at 1*.

Too many coincidences and congruences between the two TA examples discussed above, if you ask me. Especially if the fact that such events happen once in ten years or so is taken into account. Two quotes are of a relevance here:

&#x200B;

>Coincidences mean you're on the right path - *Simon van Booy*

&#x200B;

>If you gaze long enough into an asshole, the asshole will gaze back into you - u/roman_axt

&#x200B;

Some additional food for thought from TSLA:

[For redditors with a different floor](https://preview.redd.it/gnd0yienc2z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8b72e1671ad69cf871cde154ae386e52835e94a)

&#x200B;

# Game stopped, or it is just a beginning?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I am absolutely confident that you all know even more than myself about the fundamental factors at play for GME, so I will not bother you here with the background explanation. There is a plenty of good HQ DD all around reddit, so let's jump straight to the sweet sweet TA:

[GMESS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/ko1ppnasc2z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d3f7c2a78135696d66a0a70e8e2a34ad4a04dbf)

&#x200B;

At this point, I feel that a disclaimer is necessary. Let me briefly remind you that this analysis is a thesis, or a hypothesis that has to be proven in the future. I do believe that there is a solid probability for things to play out this way, and my beard supports my manly confidence. However, this is the market, and it all may go another way at any point in time, that's the nature of things! Think critically, learn and do your own DD and TA. In a good memory of u/ControlTheNarrative, at least.

And so, it begins. Despite it may seem that there are too many unknown or at least questionable variables for now in this GMESS TA, I believe that I was able to identify the most crucial parameters to build the core of this technical analysis's thesis, since VWSS and TSLASS provided many clues and identifiable characteristics to refer to. The first and most important one is surely the 'Purple Haze'. I should remind you, that this mystically sounding level persistently held back the price for both of the squeeze examples discussed, and only upon the breakout of this level the short squeezes were initiated. For GME this major price level seems to be at about $233 mark, with two intensive tests in Jan and Mar, which proved it to be the most significant resistance on the chart above.

Then, the shapes. The 'Squeezy Grail' (again occurring in between 78.6% and 100%) consolidation is also easily identifiable here, and it is yet again followed by the rectangular 'Runway' consolidation, where the price action currently stands. Remember, how historically (in TSLA and VW) the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurred somewhere near the spot of the current GME price action, in 0.382 Fibo time zone? Well, to paraphrase Ian Fleming: once is (VW) happenstance. Twice is (TSLA) coincidence. Three times is GMenemy action.

Fibos. Applying these two instruments to GME was real pain in the ass. Firstly, because the retracement is not usually used as a predictive instrument, being ordinarily applied to the completed trend. But since the situation is not ordinary at all, I played smarter (or more autistic, if you like). Due to the fact that the 'Purple Haze' level was approximately in between 78.6% and 100% Fibo in both of the previous examples, I assumed exactly that to be applicable here too. My belief is firmly backed up by this soft touch of 78.6% by the price action on Jan 28th. And when these two major levels were identified, the Fibo retracement horizontal grid just stretched out on GME itself.

Identifying the starting points for the trend for both Fibos was the most tricky part. After countless attempts and failures I found what I believe to be the cornerstone to the squeeze:

[Fibos' initiation point zoomed in](https://preview.redd.it/t2ouren1d2z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1cd87d96bb42ac20451c86059295f7560c8c44e8)

&#x200B;

Why? Because this                        ☝️ is clearly where the fun started.

And now it all matches perfectly. So, I am patiently waiting for the 'Purple Haze' to be broken. And what do you do, fellow retard?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

They say, that coincidence doesn't happen a third time. I say, we shall see.

**TL;DR** is in the comments.

Economic intervention since 2008 has fueled Wall Street’s greed, caused significant inflation, widened income & wealth gaps, & is responsible for a completely broken labor market - All to help the rich get richer","For the past year, we’ve placed a lot of focus on attacking Citadel and other short hedge funds that have participated in fraudulent and corrupt activity. While our anger is not misdirected, these institutions are just a bunch of Goombas compared to the Federal Reserve.

**The Federal Reserve is the Final  Boss**

This post is intended to help people understand the role of the Federal Reserve, in detail, and how its actions have destroyed the United States economy, specifically in the past decade.

To this day, there is an ongoing debate over whether or not the actions of the Federal Reserve were made with good intent or if their objective has always been to help the rich get richer, and I’ll leave it to readers to decide for themselves. However, whichever scenario you believe, it’s not hard to argue that the outcome of the Fed’s intervention is doing significantly more harm than good, and the result has created the largest disconnect we’ve ever experienced between Main Street and Wall Street.

Economic intervention by the Feds, since 2008, has not only further fueled Wall Street’s greed, caused significant inflation, and widened the wealth gap, it’s also responsible for the extreme wage/income equality and has completely broken our labor market.

**We’re Living Through an Experiment Run By the Federal Reserve**

Not enough people understand that the tools the Fed has implemented (quantitative easing, reverse repos, etc.) are new to our monetary policy strategy and we're living through an epic experiment that is going terribly wrong.

Fed officials pat themselves on the back for their response to 2008 and have continued to confidently report positively on the current health status of our economy, but the experiment has been dramatically changing the American economy. With every passing day, the problem just keeps getting worse and no one knows how severe the final outcome will be.

**The Fed’s New, Post Crash Strategy**

Up until 2008, the Federal Reserve’s primary responsibility was to manage and improve the unemployment rate and stabilize inflation, mainly by raising and lowering short-term interest rates.

Following the crash, they started taking extra steps to help navigate through the crisis and limit widespread poverty. They began by doing something that hadn't been done in decades — They began dropping interest rates, eventually to almost zero.

Unfortunately, the massive rate cuts did not stimulate the economy as they were intended to (I'll get into why later.) So, with Americans still suffering, and the banking system on the verge of collapse, Fed officials decided to go even further.

A committee within the Federal Reserve came up with another tool to help stimulate the economy called quantitative easing. QE was promoted under Ben Bernanke, the Fed Chairman at the time, and was an experimental way for the Fed to inject money into the financial system and lower long-term interest rates. The hope was that the lower rates would encourage more spending and borrowing throughout the economy.

In the midst of the next great depression, this would become known as the largest market intervention in world history and had never been attempted before.

The way they did it was to literally create new money. They used the money to purchase huge amounts of mortgage back securities and government debt, among other things, from banks and other institutions. Almost immediately the Fed started purchasing more than a trillion dollars worth of mortgage bonds from the banks, as quickly as possible. The idea was to get more credit and cheaper credit into the hands of the American people.

By making money so inexpensive, and making it abundant, cheap, and easy to get, they flooded the market with trillions of dollars of easy money. In theory, the expectation was that the low-interest rates and QE would have a strong positive effect on the wider economy. However, in practice, it was much less successful moving the economy.

**The Negative Effects of Intervention By the Fed**

All the easy money sparked a rally in the stock market straight away, and at the time, the plan was viewed as a success. However, there were major issues looming that had not yet come to light.

One issue was that easy money essentially emboldened investors to take bigger risks. The rally was no accident. By design the QE program effectively lowered long-term interest rates, making safer investments, like bonds less attractive, and riskier assets like stocks, more attractive.

Another main problem was that the banks were hoarding the cash, instead of making it available to borrowers.

What was playing out in practice is very different than how they theorized it would go. Insiders began to worry their tools weren’t helping the American people like they originally believed.

While the intervention may have been necessary to help stabilize the economy after the crash, it was becoming clear there was a fundamental problem with the approach, in that the tools the Fed used worked through the Wall Street banks. For that reason, the tools were benefitting the wrong people - the people who didn't really need the help.

The Fed became at the mercy of Wall Street, and insiders had hoped Congress would interject to help correct the imbalance by targeting more money to Main Street and the wider economy. However, before that was able to happen, politics took a sharp turn.

Republicans won back the House by gaining 63 seats in a major shift, with dozens of tea party-backed newcomers joining the GOP caucus. This significantly slowed any progress in Congress and the White House working together to stimulate the economy.

**The Fed Was on its Own**

After the midterm elections, the Fed announced it would do another round of QE, despite the warning signs. They claim they did so not just to stabilize the economy, but to boost it as well.

Bernanke believed it would create a more virtuous circle, lower mortgage rates, make housing more affordable, and higher stock prices to boost consumer wealth. He promoted the plan aggressively and did many interviews to fight the critics who were worried it would increase inflation.

Many critics believed that while the Fed was doing some good, there were greater concerns. The main concern was that the program was trickle-down economics, which would lead to an enormous increase in wealth inequality. We had already been seeing wealth inequality growing[ ](http://faster.si/?ce)faster since the 1970s, and this plan basically put that on steroids.

There became a rising demand for money from Wall Street. The sentiment was that the sky was going to fall if the Fed stopped printing more. Yet, no one could provide proof or an explanation that showering Wall Street with trillions of dollars was directly benefiting the average American. That was because it wasn’t.

With Wall Street and the government addicted to Free money, the Fed kept money flowing in multiple rounds of QE, injecting more than $2 trillion into the financial system. By 2013 unemployment was continuing to fall and there were signs that its policies were having a positive effect, so the Fed chairman announced that they would gradually begin tapering QE.

The announcement immediately caused the markets to drop significantly, in an event known as the ""Taper Tantrum,” which put the Fed in a difficult position. Bernate had no other choice than to backpedal his announcement to taper.

Luckily, the following year, Janet Yellen was able to successfully pause QE without disrupting the markets.

This was also around the time we started ramping up the use of reverse repos. Have you ever looked at the chart and wondered why the reverse repo seemed like a big deal when in the first spike during the 2008 crash, at the beginning of the pandemic, and right now, but for some reason, those spikes from 2013-2018 don't seem like such a big deal? My guess is that **it was a very big deal** and completely necessary to prop up the market after the printer was turned off. But just something to think about.

https://preview.redd.it/xmm6mfyk6ve81.png?width=650&format=png&auto=webp&s=d791112bbac99010371c69f9ed7b4f0c6eacb71d

To prevent the market from crashing, she also promised to maintain the Fed's massive balance sheet of assets it had bought and keep interest rates low.

Unfortunately, low rates were also causing massive issues in the economy and one of the reasons we’re now seeing movements like the Anti-Werk subreddit.

**Low-Interest Rates and the Negative Impact**

By 2018 it was believed that the economy was in a good place, citing historically low unemployment numbers and the fact that concerns about inflation hadn't materialized, and there was a growing debate of whether or not the Fed should increase interest rates and reduce the flow of easy money.

At this point, income equality became an obvious flaw in the plan. The gap between the rich and poor had grown excessively and coming out of this “good place,"" the 1% held 32% of the nation's wealth.

Even though unemployment was very low, the majority of Americans began to feel the pain of the Fed’s intervention. Most people had less than $400 in savings, which put Main Street in an extremely fragile position.

It eventually became abundantly clear that what the Fed was doing still wasn't working. Keeping rates low didn't raise growth, it raised markets, and the wealthy are the ones who owned stock.

Critics were also worried that low rates and access to easy money were causing distressing trends in Wall Street and in corporate America. One issue, in particular, was the amount of corporate borrowing. Low rates incentivized institutions to borrow more and companies were doing so, in record amounts. The Federal Government even took advantage of these rates and ran the national debt up into new highs.

Taking advantage of low rates, corporations were selling bonds to big investors. The extent of the debt was massive. Companies became so overleveraged, their credit ratings plummeted.

The Fed had hoped that companies would put all that borrowed money to good use. Traditionally, low rates prompted businesses to invest in their workforce and their infrastructure, but this time around it was playing out very differently.

Companies began borrowing money to buy back their own stock, making the remaining shares more valuable and prices higher. And instead of borrowing money to hire more workers or put more machines in more factories, businesses were using that money to invest in technology that will *eliminate* workers and reduce employee headcount. They also used that money to give CEOs and other corporate officers bonuses.

Companies would eventually issue more debt and buy back more stock, creating an endless cycle to increase the stock price, rather than improve the actual company. Since the 2018 crash, more than $600 billion has been used for stock buybacks.

It is hard to penalize the actual companies doing this because the Fed was making it so ridiculously easy. Actually taking the steps to innovate and improve a company can be difficult for any company, but what isn’t difficult is issuing debt and paying it out to your shareholders, and increasing the stock price. The problem is that that doesn't create real wealth or improve the company, and it certainly doesn't improve the labor market in any way. So, low rates eventually become a drag on our economic wealth, not a benefit.

**The Fed’s Intentions Under a Microscope**

The idea that the Fed may just be boosting financial markets and helping Wall Street has become harder and harder to deny. There is a lot of debate on how much the Fed actually helped Main Street at all, at any point. What most people do agree on is that, regardless of their intention, the Fed’s actions grew the wealth of the financial sector enormously.

There is one main problem with that. Although collectively the financial sector fulfills a necessary service, they do not provide much in return for the wealth they’ve been unevenly accumulating. They do not generate products or services and do not generate any real increase in income. Their profits are made by creating more convoluted, expensive financial instruments. They are essentially leeches on the American economy, now sucking out more than double the amount that they were before the Fed’s intervention.

The way the banking system works is no accident either, by the way. It has taken a lot of manipulation and lobbying in Congress to get to where it is today.

**Where the Most Risks Lie**

As the banking system grew, so did the risks. The amount of debt companies acquired became an increasingly dangerous liability, in the event of a downturn. There were also increasing warnings from a certain sector of financial companies that had been flourishing in the easy money economy, known as Shadow Banking.

Former US Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke provided the following definition in November 2013:

*""Shadow banking, as usually defined, comprises a diverse set of institutions and markets that, collectively, carry out traditional banking functions—but do so outside, or in ways only loosely linked to, the traditional system of regulated depository institutions. Examples of important components of the shadow banking system include securitization vehicles, asset-backed commercial paper conduits, money market funds, markets for repurchase agreements, investment banks, and mortgage companies""*

The core of the problem in shadow banks is they’re extremely fragile. Shadow institutions are not subject to the same prudential regulations as depository banks so that they do not have to keep as high financial reserves relative to their market exposure. Thus they can have a very high level of financial leverage, with a high ratio of debt relative to the liquid assets available to pay immediate claims. High leverage magnifies profits during boom periods and losses during downturns.

Anyone who is an investor, who has their money in a shadow bank, and not a real bank is going to have an incentive to withdraw in the face of any uncertainty, so little economic shocks that cause prices to fall have the potential to trigger runs. Allowing these to develop, we've inserted a sense of instability into our economic system that doesn't need to be there and that has great, negative potential.

This instability is still on the Fed's radar today. Before the pandemic, in response to the risk shadow banks pose to our economy, Jerome Powell stated the Financial Stability Council is working on a solution and is looking carefully at leveraged lending, as they are aware that the situation requires serious monitoring. However, despite those concerns, little action has been taken by other regulators or Congress, so the system remains vulnerable to shock.

They have been implicated as significantly contributing to the global financial crisis of 2007–2012. And this is probably why (copied from Wikipedia):

*The shadow banking system also conducts an enormous amount of trading activity in the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market, which grew rapidly in the decade up to the 2008 financial crisis, reaching over US$650 trillion in notional contracts traded. This rapid growth mainly arose from credit derivatives. In particular, these include:*

* *interest rate obligations derived from bundles of mortgage securities*
* *collateralized debt obligations (CDO)*
* *credit default swaps (CDS), a form of insurance against the default risk inherent in the assets underlying a CDO; and*
* *a variety of customized innovations on the CDO model, collectively known as synthetic CDOs*

*The market in CDS, for example, was insignificant in 2004 but rose to over $60 trillion in a few years.* *Because credit default swaps were not regulated as insurance contracts, companies selling them were not required to maintain sufficient capital reserves to pay potential claims. Demands for settlement of hundreds of billions of dollars of credit default swaps contracts issued by AIG, the largest insurance company in the world, led to its financial collapse. Despite the prevalence and volume of this activity, it attracted little outside attention before 2007, and much of it was off the balance sheets of the contracting parties' affiliated banks. The uncertainty this created among counterparties contributed to the deterioration of credit conditions.*

*Since then the shadow banking system has been blamed for aggravating the subprime mortgage crisis and helping to transform it into a global credit crunch.*

**The Pandemic**

When the pandemic began, people started pulling their money out of the markets causing the U.S. economy to go into free fall.

Although COVID-19 hit the global economy hard and fast, it wasn't just the pandemic that was causing a financial crisis. It was the vulnerabilities of a now highly leveraged financial system that was mainly to blame for the failure. The pandemic launched a full-on panic in the shadow banking system.

The Fed, again, sprang into action. They turned the money printing machine back on, buying hundreds and billions in debt from financial institutions. By mid-March, they made more than a trillion dollars available to the Shadow banks and they cut interest rates back down to $0. The Fed also:

* Gave half a trillion dollars to foreign central banks
* Lent half a trillion to securities dealers
* Bought $2 trillion of Treasuries securities
* Bought another $ trillion in mortgage back securities
* And flooded the zone with new government cash, to stabilize the system.

But it wasn't enough to stop the panic.

The corporate debt market had frozen up and companies were unable to finance themselves, putting the wider financial system at risk.

So, on March 23rd, 2020 the Fed took its economic experiment to a whole new level. With Congress backing the plan, Powell announced a range of new loan programs. For the first time, the Fed would be willing to buy up a massive amount of corporate debt. **This was huge.** It basically proved the Fed was willing to do whatever it takes to prevent Wall Street and Corporate America from failing.

By the end of March, Congress also passed the largest economic stimulus bill ever. The aim of the $2.2 trillion CARES Act was to provide support for individuals and small businesses.

A big portion of the bill, over a trillion dollars, was earmarked for the Fed's lending programs. But in trying to keep workers employed and companies afloat, the Fed had also used its power to rescue some of the riskiest parts of the financial system — the junk bond market.

To the critics, the Fed was sending the wrong message and rewarding the wrong people.

**The U.S. Economy is No Longer a Free Market**

Over the years, Wall Street has been trained to believe the Fed is on its side. If they win — they keep the profits. If they lose, the Fed will bend every effort and use every dollar they have to bail them out.

This completely undercuts how the Free market is supposed to work.

This idea is a moral hazard. If Wall Street believes the government and the Fed will bail them out whenever there is trouble, there is no downside to risky behavior. Because if there was a problem, the consequences wouldn't fall on them. And if they made insanely aggressive and risky bets, they would be able to keep the profits. Risk-taking is being rewarded.

And now the Fed isn’t just stepping into bailout Wall Street, they are stepping into bailout corporate America.

This is the biggest threat of capitalism. If companies make money in the good times, and the Fed steps in during the bad times it creates a never-ending cycle, and the markets never correct. It's like a no-lose casino.

In the time since the Pandemic began, corporate America has taken on more debt, the housing market and the millions of people who own stocks and bonds are seeing an extreme bull market, and the richest Americans have grown their own wealth by $1.3 trillion.

**The Current State of the Market**

Fundamentals have stopped mattering. What we're experiencing now is mania, because the Fed has put the floor underneath asset prices. Most retail traders believe there is only one direction things could go, and that's up.

Mania is a very dangerous phase. Because the Fed is pumping asset prices so high, it's impossible to actually gauge the real price of a company. They're basically creating an illusion.

Sooner or later it's all going to come down. The fact that the stock market, housing market, and the bond market are all approaching bubble territory at the same time, means when it does come down, it will be a complete and utter disaster.

**Food For thought**

This has all occurred under 4 different presidents. It kind of makes ongoing political arguments that have been heating up in recent years seem somewhat irrelevant. Democracy is an illusion. Our government is owned by the Federal Reserve; It doesn’t matter which side of the aisle you’re on, the agenda is the same.

**So, in conclusion, buy, hold, and DRS until we bring down the Federal Reserve.**

**TL;DR:** A breakdown of how the Fed’s actions have destroyed the American Economy in the past decade. Economic intervention by the Feds, in the past decade, has fueled Wall Street’s greed, caused significant inflation, widened income and wealth gaps, and is responsible for a completely broken labor market (among other problems) - All to help the rich get richer. The new tools the Fed has utilized in the past decade (quantitative easing, reverse repos, etc.) are all part of a literal experiment gone terribly wrong. And with every passing day, the problem just keeps getting worse.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/sgdk32/were_living_through_an_experiment_by_the_federal/,missing_the_point_,2022-01-30 22:05:06,16125,Superstonk

# Part I: The Crux

This post is a follow-up to my previous. I had attempted to shine some light onto a DD that was flying far too under the radar for the God-Tier level of information contained within it. It was posted roughly a month ago. It was unlike any I had read before it and till this day, continues to be unlike any I have read since. I’m talking thermonuclear level of information here.

This is the case for a few reasons. I’ll outline them below so you have a brief understanding to start. (I’ll also be quoting/referencing myself from my other post a few times to save time, so if you see similarities, just know I’m a lazy fuk).

1. **The author:** The OP behind this DD went by the name, u/leavemeanon. Shortly after dropping this thermonuclear analysis on ***HOW*** the shares have been suppressed and ***WHERE*** they are most likely located. He vanished, but unlike the Avatar’s flake ass, his job was done.
2. **The Job:** ***exposing the primary methods of fuckery utilized by the short gang, the Big Banks, and even the Fed...down to the BONE.*** The depth of analysis here is ***still*** astounding, but that’s not even the kicker..its the fact he drops a God tier DD and makes a claim like this:

https://preview.redd.it/b258dyt2y5b71.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ba0fddb29ca59535ad5bca765ddbbf4094b4643

u/leavemeanon's DD:   [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nt8ot8/rip\_uleavemeanon\_where\_are\_the\_shares\_part\_1/?utm\_medium=android\_app&utm\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nt8ot8/rip_uleavemeanon_where_are_the_shares_part_1/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

The profundity of the statement in yellow is something that you will ***only understand if you read his post.*** The likely realization you’ll come to once you do is that there is absolutely **no way that someone making** ***this claim***, drops a DD with this kind of analysis, then just goes off and deletes his account.

Self quote: “When asking myself, why tf would someone go this far into a DD analysis and delete their account shortly after? Along with going by the name u/leavemeanon, I found myself coming to the same conclusion each time:

***This. is. what. this. guy. does. He might as well be an unofficial whistle-blower who wanted no traces back to him, bc the info contained in his DD is PRECISELY what is occurring right now.”***

I wrote this statement on my previous DD just over a month ago. I want you guys to pay special attention to that last sentence because if you read through that post, you’ll realize one more thing.

**It’s not only** ***still*** **dead on, but becoming even MORE relevant in relation to the events it had described a whole-ass** ***month back.***

Now if you haven’t read the post for some dingle reason..I’ll provide you OP’s ELI5 to give a snippet of the **problem**, b/c if we do not understand the ***problem,*** **then the** ***solution*** **will not make sense.**

https://preview.redd.it/31f2e78rw5b71.png?width=701&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d74be4b534839192341f10a0fb1e770ff647ddb

So where does the problem truly lie? Based on OP’s post. It’s none other, than **the fuckin ETFs.**  OP explains the inner workings of the ETFs in a way I’ve never seen anyone do before. He even links this video for us real special apes, to understand.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iX7fOx5G40A&t=323s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iX7fOx5G40A&t=323s)

So assuming you now understand the problem, here’s an idea of the **severity**, as disclosed within part 3 of OP’s post. Spoiler alert,

https://preview.redd.it/jcke95lsw5b71.png?width=707&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d961d2f3a843e270ecc6747f7703dcd87fc1ca2

We’re not done yet, remember..only once you understand the ***full extent of the problem, will the solution make sense.*** So to add even more juice to the flame, here’s a video by **Charlie Vid’s**, which he released on July 10th. It shows how all those **RRPs**...you know..those multi-fuckin billion dollar funds being moved around on a **daily basis...are likely piled** ***right into the fuckin E T F’s.***

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhS5FgfO6Jg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhS5FgfO6Jg)

This video has only stood to further validate the point u/leavemeanon **made a whole ass month back.** The information he’s discussing is still pretty novel and needs more eyes, but the connection he makes in that video is hard to argue against. Even if you don’t fully grasp wtf that shit means, and let's be honest, most of us still don't b/c RRPs are the most absurdly convoluted thing on this planet. Nonetheless, the big picture is pretty evident. From this video, it seems almost entirely plausible that these transactions between the Fed and the other end of the parties involved (the Big Banks) are being done illegally at historic levels, to ***keep the entire market from collapsing.***

To provide a better idea of what *may* be going on here, I'm going to refer to someone who seems to have a far clearer grasp on these transactions than myself. I'm fine with speculating on most things but these RRPs though, I'm way too smooth-brained for that and the last thing I need is to be throwing a 69th definition of what they mean into the mix.

https://preview.redd.it/hpucxdxtw5b71.png?width=1121&format=png&auto=webp&s=79fbcdd82cae68bad05dffec310c6f841199ee52

This may also explain why most of the rules released in relation to the derivatives market seem to have only slowed down recent events, but not much more. I'm saying this because the way some of those rules were written, they sounded like they would dice up the short's plan of approach completely. Though there does ***seem*** to be a clear impact on how GME has been trading since most of the rules were implemented, ***they haven't ended the game.*** To me, this likely means that the greatest source of fuckery held by Shortgang and Co. lies elsewhere.

The Married-puts, the dark pools, or whatever else method of manipulation these limp-dick cum-dumpsters have up their sleeves may be *some* of the better-known gears behind their scheme, but I'm willing to be ***it's the ETFs, which are the true source of their Fuckery.*** **These transactions described in the video above, and further theorized upon by the comment attached, are occurring** ***through the entire ETF market.***

# Part II - The Connection

Now that you understand the problem, we are *almost* cleared to move onto the solution. Before going further, I need to provide some context here.  My previous post, as mentioned earlier, was intended for a single purpose: Shedding light on u/leavemeanon’s DD. Shortly after dropping it though, I received a comment and message from a few users who sent me down one hell of a rabbit hole. As in that post, I was making some tin-foil hat connections to the meaning behind u/leavemeanon's username. Though this part may not necessarily even be linked, it's important I mention it because had it not happened, I would not have discovered what I believe to be the ***solution***.

Moving forward from here, we’re going to be **treading over some speculative waters** and more than likely, be testing that 4-hour erection window before you need to call your doctor. They might have to raise the bar on that one if the following of what I’ve found is ***even remotely correct.***

This part may sound absurd at first, but I only ask you to trust me until you reach part 3. For most of part 2, I'm explaining because I feel it important to clarify *how I came to my conclusions.* My thoughts in this section don't necessarily *have* to be true, and I wouldn't be surprised to find out if this ends up being the case in the future.

That being said, ***their relevance in this DD is that of an intermediate***. They are what helped me discover what I believe to be **the** ***solution for the problem described above.***

My speculative journey would lead me down an immense rabbit hole roughly a month ago. It would begin with a fascination with Anon's DD but soon evolved to also include **the method of its deployment (OP deleting his account shortly after dropping it), the technical but extremely concise language utilized, and the structure of its writing,** as I began to ponder the ***meaning behind OP's name***.

The now-deleted user, who went by the name of **'leavemeanon""** would ring a few bells for another ape, that would comment the following on my post:

https://preview.redd.it/bk2rbtcvw5b71.png?width=660&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd3afb645f019a42f0d0ae6630c8501cdab70d45

It was at this point that I began to speculate whether there was a connection between Anon's name and the phrase above found on Gamestop's NFT website. Now I cannot state that there is a direct relation between the two, but I find it necessary to shed light on the connection I theorized (with the help of some amazing apes), regarding what ***I believed it to be.***

what if, the now-deleted OP's name was in reference to more than just 'leave me anonymous'? What if...OP's name was an attempt to send us a message about the material covered in his post in regard to the ETF market?

Here is the likely-to-be unlikely link: the word Anon is defined as ""soon, shortly"". OP went by the name LeaveMeAnon. I.e leave me '***soon, shortly'.*** So naturally, I went full tin-foil mode and chased the idea further down the hole. I made the following assumption in doing so, what if OP was telling us,

""the material I'm covering, the current ETF market as we know it, is to be ***left behind soon/shortly, and let me explain why""***

Whereas '**Game on, Anon',** a phrase located throughout Gamestop's NFT website, if used under the same pretense, could refer to ***""Game on, Soon/shortly"".***

So the link that would bring me to the absurdly coincidental connection that may, or may not have been fueled by an unhealthy amount of confirmation bias at the time:

Anon's post is created with knowledge equitable to damn near Burry himself, with the sole purpose of exposing where the ***true problem lies*** in the GME saga. He mentions married-puts, high-frequency trading, and ETFs in-depth to show this. Yet, it is the **latter most issue that gets the largest emphasis placed on it. Why do I believe that?**

**Primarily because the more I looked into this situation, the more I began to see that the institutions involved on the short side of GME aren't the Castle of glass, they simply** ***live in it***. The Castle itself...is the entire ***ETF market.*** A structure which throughout and within it have become increasingly prevalent by the passing of each day. They are quite literally, ***a legal method of naked shorting***.

Where Anon takes the time to reveal the problem, it's **Gamestop**, the company itself, that has quite literally been showing us the ***solution to this problem.*** All of which it has been doing through its ***actions, not its words.***

# Part III - The Solution

If you made it this far, just know I'm proud :')

Part II is certainly the most tin-foil section in this post, but as you proceed through part III, you'll soon realize why I found it necessary to provide all that information. This is certainly my favorite part. Stick through to the end and you'll see why we save the best, for last.

Moving forward right where we left off - If you go onto that same NFT website, copy the link which is posted on their NFT page, paste it into google, and open the first tab from the etherscan website and click on the ‘contracts tab’, guess what you’ll find there...

https://preview.redd.it/dw2amyuww5b71.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=71586f7708fd74a1dc32d2d77bee979d47d8a668

Still, think it’s a simple coincidence? It's alright, I mean ""it’s not it actually means anything…***” right Anakin?”.....\*zooms in closer\*.....” right..?\****

Lol don’t actually try to zoom in, there isn’t shit there if you do that. **But… third time’s a charm, right? what if there's more to that phrase than just some random ass meaning?**

To find out, I did some more digging around that term after finding the above which would lead me to find the following tweet:

[https:\/\/acceleratedcapital.substack.com\/p\/the-metaverse-index-](https://preview.redd.it/3g9t4kxxw5b71.png?width=553&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e69a9e45aaab0e47149e9ef8d48a895e4a069df)

That phrase...look familiar? Yeah...we’re about to enter solution territory...and for you “I only believe after a 4th, 5th, 6th coincidence” apes, don't worry. I’ll get there anon ;)

The link above will take you directly to the page they’ve shown. Upon finding this tweet, I looked into what exactly these guys were talking about. After reading in-depth about what exactly this ‘Metaverse’ is, as well as viewing some of the other links they have posted on their website, you’ll find information about its relation to **NFTs,** ***Blackrock***, and something known as the **Index Cooperative**.

Now, why exactly are these things all noteworthy? Well, if you don’t live under a rock and are a certified retarde like yours truly, you’ll remember **some hype going around with Gamestops NFT plans.** But before we get to that, let’s put this together in a cascading manner so you fully grasp what we’re looking at here.

What is the ***Metaverse*** exactly?

* Per Wikipedia: “***The Metaverse is a collective, virtual shared space, created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical reality and physically persistent virtual space, including the sum of all virtual worlds, augmented reality, and the internet”***
* It’s further described as a basket of 15 tokens that serve the purpose of capturing entertainment trends, sports, and business shifting to virtual reality.
* The next absolutely fascinating find in regard to the Metaverse index is one that requires you to zoom out and view the bigger picture. By doing so, you'll begin to understand ***what it's trying to change***. An article that goes extremely in-depth on it would provide this insight:

[ https:\/\/www.masterthemeta.com\/business-breakdowns\/into-the-void](https://preview.redd.it/0evviqy7x5b71.png?width=706&format=png&auto=webp&s=c42c57f41dbd2a47f856799c5b1fbca70e79b9a2)

This article above (absolutely excellent read btw) is what links our **topic of focus. N F Ts.** Notice the **black-highlighted sections, primarily** ***the bottom one.***

This information takes us back to Accelerated Capitals website. Here we find a bit more relative information to ***virtual ownership via NFTs, gaming,*** ***virtual reality, and entertainment""***, as well as the **inclusion criteria it has before an NFT can be issued under it.**

[https:\/\/acceleratedcapital.substack.com\/p\/the-metaverse-index-](https://preview.redd.it/zqyi588bx5b71.png?width=519&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e30ec3cb2e5d9cfe689bf66d55b119a1c0741e6)

I highlighted the 3 month period because if I remember correctly...there’s a company out there that has something to do with gaming, which was supposed to go bankrupt..but didn’t..and similarly ***issued an NFT token a few months back...what the date on that?*** **4/07, now I'm not the best at math but roughly 3 months since then would be...😎 (s/o** [u/LordoftheEyez](https://www.reddit.com/u/LordoftheEyez/) for the help on clarifying the timeframe!)

But let's get a bit more specific, **wtf** ***is the Metaverse Index really?***

https://preview.redd.it/zzodtd4ex5b71.png?width=560&format=png&auto=webp&s=7751bd534f1a59ef5852a709c93fe7e153864077

Oh boy, well now we’re getting somewhere. After looking into what exactly the Metaverse index was, I found myself directed towards something called the ***Index Cooperative (Coop Index).*** Think of this thing as the **very top of the cascade, it contains** ***other blockchain-based indices within it, such as the Metaverse Index.*** Upon visiting The Index Coop website, you get a pretty baseline idea of what it is to better explain:

https://preview.redd.it/k3lb9ebfx5b71.png?width=670&format=png&auto=webp&s=72448ae5aad8c7dfa1ec6d27ee55884c8db2231e

Just a refresher on the cascade of terms here as I explained them a bit out of order, from the highest --> lowest level of priority. (also priority here isn't me saying least is worst lol, it's simply in relation to where they actually fall relative to one another)

**Index Cooperative > Metaverse, etc > NFTs**

Because this cascade functions ***entirely separate from the modern-day stock market which includes modern-day ETFs as we know them, they play by COMPLETELY different rules.***

* **It’d be an absolute shame if a company that was** ***shorted to high-hell...decided to jump ship and hop into this thermonuclear fueled fuckin rocket,*** and light up all the dipshits who decided to bet against it..
* ***A shame for those dipshits, that is.*** Fkn dingles lmayo..alright back to semi-serious mode...

Going forward, I did some deep dives through other Reddit pages to learn more about this thing, and to my surprise, I got a damn good explanation of ***what EXACTLY is the Index Coop attempting to become. It is as follows,***

https://preview.redd.it/18rghmqgx5b71.png?width=351&format=png&auto=webp&s=d86df95bc179c813eab794690b4e909f681427a2

""**OVERVIEW OF INDEX""**

""[Index Cooperative](https://www.indexcoop.com/) is a DeFi project that’s going after the multi-trillion-dollar \[ETF\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded\_fund#:\~:text=An%20exchange%2Dtraded%20fund%20(ETF,the%20day%20on%20stock%20exchanges)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund#:~:text=An%20exchange%2Dtraded%20fund%20(ETF,the%20day%20on%20stock%20exchanges)) (exchange-traded fund) market. At its simplest, an ETF is like a basket of assets (be it stocks, bonds, commodities, or crypto) that can be traded in a group. Companies like [Blackrock (under its subsidiary iShare) and Vanguard each have over a trillion dollars](https://www.etftrends.com/10-biggest-etf-issuers-of-2019-by-market-capitalization/) under management in the form of ETFs. ETFs have been so popular, that people like [Michael Burry ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Burry)(of [*The Big Short* ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Short_(film))) have called it a “[passive investment bubble](https://www.etfstrategy.com/passive-investing-a-bubble-says-big-short-investor-michael-burry-10449/)”.""

Two things should stick out to you off the bat:

1. “Own the ***Blackrock*** of DeFi” while stating ***Ethereum ETFs as being a business with a multi-trillion dollar upside.***
2. *""Index Cooperative* ***is a DeFi project that's going AFTER the Muti-trillion ETF market”***

Putting these two together took a minute, I found myself asking, how tf Blackrock was thrown into the loop? so I started scavenging through a few more articles through Accelerated Capitals page and found this:

https://preview.redd.it/hm2475wjx5b71.png?width=523&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a6774dc5f83719f90e5106767f6a53a222267a3

**TA:DR/conclusion:**

Let's bring all this together now, because if you've made it this far, then you're likely still taking all this in. I know, it's a lot to take in and I also understand that some of my conclusions are speculative. In the end, **this is truly all we can do until the elephant in the room gets so big, that it is no longer possible to ignore or deny it.** For this reason, I ask each and every one of my fellow apes to dig into every piece of information I've provided above and **reason these things out for themselves. Follow the evidence, question the data, question the logic, and deduce the flaws. Only then can you truly justify to yourself that the investment you've made in this stock, was done so out of confidence, and genuine Due-Diligence.**

We began by introducing the problem, because, like any other problem you wish to solve, you must first **understand the problem.** The more complex and/or convoluted that problem is, oftentimes the longer it can take to ascertain the necessary information in ***properly*** learning about it. This is something we covered in part I, in which section I introduced you to the **elephant in the room, the ETF market, or as I like to call it, The** ***Glass Castle.***

In part II, I provided insight into what I like to think of as the ***intermediate,*** between the **problem and the** ***solution.*** Though I do not have high expectations for those connections to be outright true, they did not need to be. Their purpose was served the moment they led me to find everything I wrote about in part III.

Within this final part, I described to you ***the solution***. IF I'm right in my thought process here, THEN the actions being taken by RC and Gamestop are quite literally, ***pointing in a single direction***.

**Changing the game and giving the** ***power back to the players*** **isn't just about changing the company, no...It's about shifting the ENTIRE damn landscape of how the modern-day economy functions.** This change, the NFT initiative currently being taken by GME is with damn near certainty moving towards one goal..before we describe that goal, let me provide one last refresher, but this time with analogy's so there is not a single ape left behind.

1. At the very top, you have the largest basket: the **Index Cooperative** (**think of this as the new blockchain stock market)**
2. Within this large basket, you have multiple medium-sized baskets: The **Metaverse Index, Defi-Pulse index, etc.** **(Think of this like the SP.Y)**
3. And within individual *medium-sized* baskets, you’ve got **NFT’s** **(think a jet-fueled gaming company ran by a fuckin 69D chess master)**

Imagine an economy where there is no longer a middle man, by which I mean the modern-day banking system as we know it. Ask yourself, if you had the ability to choose a completely different system, where the ***power of decision-making and investing potential lies in your hands, and not in that of some middle-man who would rather use it for his own personal benefit at the cost of YOUR losses, would you use it?***

Quite ***likely***, I'd say. Unless you enjoy getting hoed by greedy scumbags, but you probably wouldn't have made it this far in this post had that been the case. This leaves us to the ultimate question, *what exactly is RC doing?*

Based on everything I've shown you, **He's planning on cutting out the middle-man.** These modern-day Big Banks and pretty much every other financial institution from the SEC to the Fed have been laying in bed together for decades. In doing so, they thrived within their castle while the rest of humanity continued to struggle, often unable to make even our most *basic* ends meet.

Yet in the end, it was *this* greed that blinded them. *This* greed allowed their own naivety to consume them. Most importantly, it was their unending hunger for power and wealth that created a facade so great, that they could no longer see that karma isn't a bitch. Karma is a f**uckin mirror.** This is the true cost of their ""opportunity"".

And those cracks? Each day that passes, they spread further and deeper. Its flaws can no longer be **unseen, nor can they be** ***undone.***

**Only, replaced.**

I'd argue the game isn't *about* to change...but rather,

I'd argue, **it already** **has.**

P.S Larry Cheng, GME board member, and Matt Finestone, Blockchain guy.

None of this is financial advice, I repeat, I still do not know how to walk on all two's. Thank you for your time.

EDIT: There's a pretty fancy pants wrinkly-brained ape down in the comments who did a solid job of providing a description of the kind of changes I had envisioned while writing this DD. I didn't get around to including most of the things he's stating, but they are certainly on the same track of thought process. So, it's only right I add his comment for all apes to see. I've described the process, this is what the results, I believe, will look like,

https://preview.redd.it/ptyywbopx5b71.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9b3fe851f9f02a4b6e0fc803430a2ee68f697de

**EDIT 2:** This post was partly inspired by this ape, I had shared my previous DD onto the post containing the video which tied the RRPs to the ETFs. Upon further conversing with this ape last night, he provided me with, what seems to be a hint and I believe, this is what he's getting at. I'm at my 20 image count but this was his statement:

""I'll drop this Easter egg on you.""

""Simplicity. Complexity is meant to hide complexity in the markets. Also meant to distance simplicity in relationships. The most complex situations are usually handed over a simple old fashion between friends...or foes. Game on Anon""

**My response, after pondering these words:**

""simplicity...simplicity in a complex situation, is leaving the complex situation entirely. Their system and all of its cracks, cannot be unseen, nor undone. To replace a system that is so evidently flawed with its complexities requires a simple solution\*, leaving it behind entirely, and creating something new.\*

""This is my take on your wise words. Game on Anon""

**TIT SLAPPIN EDIT 3:** Holy fucking. **shit. Apes, I need all eyes on this.**

**Please correct me if I'm wrong as this is out of my field.....but tell me this doesn't fuckin read the way** ***I think it reads...***

**Edit 4:** Alright apes, I'm just getting around to updating this for inclusion of insight from an ape who is far more versed into this type of language than yours truly. The portion you see below was a conversation I had with this very kind mod from another sub, as I had to post this in other locations due to the initial difficulty of getting it onto the 'Stonk. This portion has actually been included in the other posts but since I submitted **this** version **before having the conversation below, and it was pushed forward by the mods on superstonk at a later time, it didn't incorporate this conversation at that time.** Hence, why I've provided this edit now. It's been a long 24 hours fighting the good fight in an attempt to get people on this sub to see this material, and though a success, I had to rest up so my body could hodl. That's the context, **now the insight.**

The breakdown provided by Theta here *seems to be* ***far more conclusive in regard to what all that suit talk is truly stating***\*\*. Read it a few times over if you have to, but if logic is our basis, then this does make sense until unless we find out otherwise.\*\* Additionally, this ape was able to look around and find some backing for his statement as well! So truly bravo to you sir, know that your assistance in this is greatly appreciated u/Theta-Voidance.

Naturally, where one perspective is correct in deducing the suit-speak, another deduction remains ape-speak. So I crossed off my initial assessment now that we've been provided some cleaner insight, but you'll still find it below for your apely pleasures.

**~~I've read this literally 20 times over...I've even read the last two damn pages 20 times over to make sure what it's leading up to is actually~~** ***~~what I think it is...~~***

And another addition from an Ape that brought some more fascinating insight to me earlier as well, This is in respect to the **initial NFT token issued by Gamestop a few months back, here's his findings:**

""Killer DD! So **we know the ERC-721 is the 1 GME coin.** The **Metaverse uses ERC-20** tokens from my understanding.

Securities clearinghouses and depositories are essential to the smooth, efficient, and resilient operation of modern financial markets. Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that they make the scale and speed of modern finance possible. At the same time, the growing importance of these financial market infrastructures has led to legitimate concerns about their systemic importance and market power. These concerns recently reached a fevered pitch after longstanding rules imposed by the dominant securities clearinghouse temporarily forced the popular online trading platform Robinhood to suspend new buy orders in GameStop and several other popular “meme” stocks. The aftermath has sparked public outcry, congressional hearings, and even calls for an SEC investigation. It also revealed the enormous power wielded by an obscure but vital component of our financial market infrastructure: the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC).

***2021 Open Access, Inter Open Access, Interoperability ability, and the DTCC's Path to Monopoly***

&#x200B;

[https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&context=law\_and\_economics\_wp](https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&context=law_and_economics_wp)

Monopolies and monopoly power can contribute to the emergence and amplification of a firm’s systemic importance. The resulting too-big-to-fail problem received widespread attention in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, when the systemic importance of a small handful of financial institutions created the perception— and, in some cases, the reality—that the government would bail them out rather than risk their failure destabilizing the financial system and broader economy. The too-big-to-fail problem imposes a number of costs on society. First, the expectation that a firm is too-big-to-fail generates moral hazard. ***Specifically, the expectation of a government bailout undermines the incentives of the firm’s creditors to monitor its capital structure, business decisions, and overall financial health. The resulting lack of oversight then gives the managers of the firm free rein to take socially excessive risks. Compounding matters, this expectation will often serve to lower the cost of financing for too-big-to-fail firms. In effect, if a firm’s creditors expect the government to bail them out, they will be willing to lend the firm money at lower interest rates. Viewed in this light, the too-big-to-fail problem is yet another source of competitive distortions: giving too-big-to-fail firms access to an important resource—capital—at a lower price than their smaller competitors. This, in turn, exacerbates their systemic importance by enabling already dominant firms to further increase their market share.***

Securities clearinghouses and depositories are essential to the smooth, efficient, and resilient operation of modern financial markets. Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that they make the scale and speed of modern finance possible. At the same time, the growing importance of these financial market infrastructures has led to legitimate concerns about their systemic importance and market power. These concerns recently reached a fevered pitch after longstanding rules imposed by the dominant securities clearinghouse temporarily forced the popular online trading platform **Robinhood to suspend new buy orders in GameStop** and several other popular stocks. The aftermath has sparked public outcry, congressional hearings, and even calls for an SEC investigation. It also revealed the enormous power wielded by an obscure but vital component of our financial market infrastructure: the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC).

This Article sheds new light on how DTCC came to possess so much power over U.S. securities markets. Fifty years ago, American securities markets were supported by a number of regional clearinghouses and depositories, each connected to a regional stock exchange. 33 Today, a single firm—the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC)—is the only remaining clearinghouse,while another—the Depository Trust Corporation (DTC)—is the only remaining depository. Even more remarkably, both NSCC and DTC are owned by the same parent company: DTCC. So what happened? To answer this question, this Article provides the first detailed historical account of why these twin industries have become so highly concentrated. Intuitively, we might expect the answer to be grounded in the economies of scale and network effects associated with securities clearing and settlement. However, while this is undoubtedly an important piece of the puzzle, the answer also stems from a series of 1975 amendments to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that, ironically, were originally designed to enhance competition with the U.S. securities clearing and depository markets. These amendments prohibited the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from granting NSCC and DTC monopolies over their respective industries.

Instead, Congress ordered the SEC “to facilitate the establishment of linked or coordinated facilities for clearance and settlement of transactions in securities.” In turn, the SEC ordered NSCC, DTC, and other clearing agencies to “establish full interfaces or appropriate links with the clearing agencies of designated regional exchanges.” Put simply: Congress and the SEC sought to use open access and interoperability requirements to promote more vigorous competition. Yet less than thirty years later, NSCC and DTC were the last firms standing. Rather than promoting greater competition, the SEC’s open access and interoperability requirements became an instrument by which large incumbent firms obtained, consolidated, and entrenched their dominant market positions. This concentration occurred for three reasons. First, these coordination requirements did not eliminate the need for each regional clearinghouse and depository to build and maintain the technological and operational linkages that allowed them to connect to the new SEC-mandated market infrastructure. The high fixed costs of building these linkages placed a disproportionate burden on smaller firms, putting them at a competitive disadvantage. Second, the SEC’s coordination requirements enabled larger firms like NSCC and DTC to dictate the direction and pace of their rivals’ technological innovation. Whenever NSCC and DTC introduced technological improvements to their clearing and depository systems, the SEC’s coordination requirements forced their regional competitors to make enormous infrastructure investments to ensure the technological compatibility of their own products and services. This, in turn, contributed to market consolidation, since whenever NSCC and DTC adopted new products and services, they forced the regional firms to do so as well—and to bear the substantial costs of building better, faster, and more resilient clearing and depository systems.

**The SEC’s focus on promoting competition was also reflected in the concerns of market participants and other regulators that NSCC and DTC would abuse their growing market power. During the late 1970s, the SEC received comments from the regional clearinghouses, the Department of Justice (DOJ) antitrust division, and the FTC challenging the SEC’s approach to the National Market System on the ground that it was anticompetitive and would open the door for** **NSCC and DTC to obtain monopolies.** In 1977, in its Order approving NSCC’s registration, the SEC, too, expressed concern “that competing clearing corporations would be unable to offer comparable services.

Yet just twenty years after Congress amended the Securities Exchange Act to create the National Market System, and only fifteen years after the SEC first granted registration to NSCC, DTC, and other clearing agencies, all the regional clearinghouses and depositories had halted their operations and transferred their functions and responsibilities to NSCC and DTC. Accordingly, while the SEC’s coordination requirements did eventually lead to the creation of a national market infrastructure, they did so not by establishing a truly open and interoperable network for securities clearing and settlement. Instead, as described below, interoperability and open access requirements ultimately contributed to the demise of the regional clearinghouses and depositories by imposing high fixed costs to connect to the new interfaces, allowing NSCC and DTC to dictate the direction and pace of innovation, and preventing firms from differentiating their products and services from those of their competitors.

\*\*\*\*\*Predictably, once DTCC gained complete control over U.S. securities clearing and depository markets, evidence emerged that suggested it might be abusing its monopoly position.\*\*\*\*\*Until 2009, the NYSE, NASD, and Amex each owned one-third of the shares in DTCC. As a result, the two dominant exchanges were part-owners of the clearinghouse and depository that, by 1997, served all of their principal competitors. The other owner, NASD, was made up of the country’s largest broker-dealers. DTCC’s member-owners appear to have used this position to advance their broader business interests. For example, in 2006, DTC promulgated a rule that made it difficult for non-members, regional exchanges, and brokers that were not members of NASD to hold securities that are recorded in DTC’s book-entry system. The rule forced these nonmember transfer agents to open accounts with their direct competitors. If the nonmember transfer agents declined to do so, they would have been unable to record securities ownership electronically, which at that point was required of all transfer agents. This rule triggered vociferous protests from firms that competed with NASD members, since it forced them to choose between opening accounts with their competitors and exiting the market. One competitor objected that DTC had “become a de facto regulator of the entire transfer agent industry” and argued that it was using its position as “a monopoly \[to\] engage\[\] in predatory, anti-competitive conduct with respect to its direct competitors.”Over a decade later, similar objections were voiced after NSCC rules effectively forced online broker Robinhood to temporarily limit but orders in shares of GameStop and other popular “meme” stocks.

Simultaneously, the exchanges that competed with the NYSE and Amex for equity trading volumes complained that NSCC charged excessively high membership fees. Since the exchanges that owned NSCC were exempted from these membership fees, the NYSE and Amex appear to have been using their control over NSCC to increase their competitors’ costs.257 One competitor, Nasdaq, even considered building its own securities clearinghouse and acquired BCC and SCCP’s clearing facilities to reduce the costs of clearing securities transactions. While Nasdaq ultimately decided not to clear its own transactions, it did so only after NSCC reduced prices in response to the prospect that Nasdaq would emerge as a competitor. The DOJ also expressed concern that NSCC was favoring its owner exchanges, claiming that NSCC provided superior service to the NYSE and Amex by processing trades executed on those exchanges more quickly than those executed on their competitors’ platforms. In response to concerns that NSCC and DTC were favoring their parent exchanges, the SEC was eventually pushed to impose a series of corporate governance reforms. These reforms included forcing the NYSE and Amex to sell their shares in DTCC. ***Today, DTCC is mutually owned by the banks and brokers that participate in it, with its corporate governance having been rebuilt to represent a wider spectrum of the financial services industry, including “its financial institution participants, their issuer and investor clients and the governmental and supervisory authorities responsible for the global clearance and settlement systems***.

**\*\*The Security and Exchange Commission, the SEC, is the police force for Wall Street. Their top job is to protect the public.\*\***

The Depository Trust Clearing Corporation, the DTCC’s is a private company whose job is to oversee the settlement of virtually all the trades in the United States Market. In other words, the ***DTCC’s main job is to make sure the brokers are delivering real shares and not counterfeit shares to the investment public.***

The Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs is a Congressional Committee responsible for overseeing the SEC, the Stock Market, and the Banks. They are the ultimate watchdogs of the Economy.

\*\*If a corporation did a 100% dividend share distribution to its shareholders and assuming all of the shares were held at the DTCC, then the Transfer Agent would send a ""real"" certificate made out to Cede and Co. for 100 million shares. Why then would the next monthly statements of the shareholders collectively total up to an extra 400 million shares theoretically having been delivered by the TA to the DTCC? **The trouble is that the fraudulent behavior associated with the naked short selling of shares by Wall Street ""professionals"" and their co-conspirators in the clearing agencies and the Lending Departments, begets the necessity to commit cover up frauds every time a shareholder tries to exercise one of the missing ""rights"" that are only attached to ""real"" shares. These bogus electronic entries in the clearing agencies are not ""shares"" and do not have the rights attached to that issuer.** **THE ENTITIES BEING SOLD DO NOT EXIST.\*\***

**\*\*We would warn the SEC not to expect too many comment letters this time around. These investors have had it. Back in 1999, the vast majority of 2700 commenters** ***begged*** **you to throw them a lifeline in regards to this naked short selling issue. Here we are over 4 years later commenting on Regulation SHO. \*\*The only bets being placed now have to deal with how long Wall Street can stall its implementation.\*\* Please act quickly, this country's financial system is much too important to toy with. What advances have been made over this past 1,500 day period subsequent to one of the most massive pleas for help in the history of the SEC.\*\***

Throughout the process of designing these new rules, we ask that you keep one fact at the forefront of your mind. That being that the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (""DTCC"") is aggressively driving towards STP or ""straight through processing."" This means that the trade date will equal the settlement date, i.e., settlement date will be referred to as T+0. This single event will increase the levels of naked short selling abuses we currently see many many-fold as ""failed deliveries"" will be the norm and not the exception and abusive and intentional failed deliveries will be **camouflaged.** Therefore, whatever rules you implement now will be severely diluted should STP become a reality. We noticed this trend back when settlement date changed from T+5 to T+3 several years ago. The DTCC's never-ending quest for clearing and settling trades at light speed, no matter what the effect on the INTEGRITY of the process, needs to be addressed.

One caveat, in this letter we will use the term ""naked short selling"" as is currently used in the vernacular. The term ""naked short selling"", for the record, is an unfortunate misnomer. ""Short selling"" refers to the sale of legitimate, borrowed ""shares/packages of rights"", in the hopes of repurchasing them at a later time for a lesser amount. The borrowed ""shares/packages of rights"" are then returned to the lender. **Shares are, of course, a ""package of rights"" attached to a specific public corporation**. **They include the right to vote the percentage of equity ownership purchased, the right to dividends that don\`t dilute the percentage of equity ownership, to residual rights in the case of dissolution, to preeminent rights, the right to sell at a time of one's choosing, the right to become the nominal/legal owner by taking delivery of a certificate with one's name on it, the right to use this proof of ownership to collateralize business or personal loans, etc.**

The term **""naked short selling""** would thus refer to the selling of **legitimate** ""shares/packages of rights"", without first borrowing them. On Wall Street, the reference to ""naked short selling"" is of a much more heinous nature than the name implies. That which is being sold by unethical market makers, clearing firms, and co-conspirators and purchased by investors is not a legitimate ""share/package of rights"".Legitimacy is dictated by the existence of a corresponding certificated share bearing the signature of the Corporate Treasurer and Transfer Agent, somewhere in the system. The entity being sold and purchased in ""naked short selling"" does not exist. A public corporation has a **finite** number of ""rights"" to vote, receive dividends, etc. The entities being bought and sold are above and beyond this finite number of ""shares/package of rights"".

In ""legal"" short selling there are intrinsic checks and balances in existence to prevent massive fraud. By far the most important being that the number of shares that can LEGALLY be sold short is governed by the number of shares that can be LEGALLY borrowed. This would be comprised of the issuer's ""float"" less the number of ""fully paid for shares"", excess margin securities, and shares held in qualified retirement plans subject to the 1974 ERISA Act. Thankfully, the thinly traded securities of the OTCBB and Pink Sheets, which are the most susceptible to short selling frauds, do not have a high percentage of shares that are ""lendable"" since most of these shares are non-marginable. In naked short selling, this, the most important intrinsic governing mechanism is gone by the wayside. This fact, in conjunction with the DTCC's allowance of a ""real"" share to be loaned out in more than one direction at any given time, accounts for the reason we find ""open positions"" or accumulated fails to deliver or loans made to mask these fails in excess of 300 and 400% during the discovery phase of naked short selling civil cases.

\*\****They assume that the regulators are professionals, that they know every dirty trick in the fraudsters' playbook, and could recognize a fraud while it is being perpetrated. These investors really think that they are buying ""real"" shares from a ""real"" shareholder, perhaps across the country, with a market maker acting as the middleman. They see no need to ask for the delivery of their certificated shares to prevent fraud. In fact, corrupt broker/dealers will attempt to talk their clients out of demanding certificates and/or make it cost prohibitive to do so. We got a kick out a brokerage firm's comment letter during the last ""short sales"" comment period back in 1999. In it this firm urged fellow DTCC participants to just hike up their fees for certificate delivery to thwart investors demanding proof of their purchase. This firm cited a 70% decrease in demands for delivery after doing this. Investors also do not have a clue that their own broker/dealer, who owes the investor a fiduciary duty of care after being paid a commission as an agent, is ""renting"" out their purchased shares to the mortal enemy of the client's investment. The investor has been ""sold out"" by his own brokerage firm. There isn't even any sharing of the rental income from the loan.\*\****

The fiduciary duty of care owed to the client/investor seems to disappear as the shares purchased head into the DTCC where t**hey are held in an anonymous ""pooled"" format.** Because of this anonymity, Shareholder ""Sam"" would have a tough time making a case against his brokerage firm for breach of this duty and being ""sold out"" in exchange for a rental check. Where did the fiduciary duty disappear to as these ""shares""/ nonexistent entities entered into the DTCC system? Can you find it with a GPS? The naïve investor does not realize that there would be consequences for his brokerage firm if it were to ""break ranks"" and do the right thing. The Wall Street community and various co-conspirators have made this issue into a ""Wall Street versus investors"" battle.

What is really troublesome to the legal community is the fact that the SEC already has in its possession the power and the mandate to address these naked short-selling problems. The 1934 Securities Exchange Act gave it to them.The crime being committed is actually a hybrid between counterfeiting and a 10b-5 securities fraud. In our opinion, the SEC does not have the power or mandate to allow ""would be"" bona fide market makers to sell nonexistent ""packages of rights"" attached to a specific public corporation in exchange for a U.S. citizen's hard-earned cash.

We are convinced that the various State Securities regulators, if they understood the concept of naked short selling, **would have had an absolute fit if t*****hey knew that the SEC was even considering allowing market makers to sell entities that don't exist and thereby dilute the equity ownership of investors in their states,*** or to fraudulently distribute counterfeit shares of public companies domiciled in their states. This only illustrates how little people know about ""naked short selling"" and the role of the DTCC.

\*\*\*Once within the system, the DTCC treats them as genuine shares and allows these counterfeit electronic book entries to earn dividends, vote at annual meetings, exercise preeminent rights, residual rights, and the right to sell these ""entities"" to others as if they were real. The DTCC is thereby distributing unregistered securities of issuers with no exemption from registration in sight. This is, of course, strictly forbidden by the '33 Act. These are the very crimes you at the SEC have been prosecuting for decades but in this case at the DTCC the scale of the crimes being committed are beyond imagination and it is occurring right under your noses-literally, across the street from your offices on Wall Street.\*\*\*DTCC then allows its participants to mislead their clients on their monthly brokerage statements into believing that they had bought and received delivery of ""real"" shares with all of the rights of share ownership attached. These are not real ""shares"" of a specific public company that have a ""package of rights"" attached to them.

EU watchdog fines DTCC for derivatives repository failings

LONDON, March 31 (Reuters) - The European Union’s markets watchdog has fined the U.S. DTCC Derivatives Repository Ltd 64,000 euros ($72,620) for failing to give regulators speedy access to its data on trades as required under the bloc’s laws.During the 2007-09 financial crisis regulators were unable to see who was on both sides of a derivatives trades in order to assess risks of defaults. New laws require all trades to be reported to a repository that gives regulators access to the data.The EU’s European Securities and Markets Authority said in a statement on Thursday the fine was due to DTCC “negligently failing to put in place systems capable of providing regulators with direct and immediate access to derivatives trading data”.

The Stock Borrow Program was purportedly set up to facilitate expedited clearance of stock trades. Somewhere along the line, the DTCC became aware that if it could lend a single share an unlimited number of times, it could collect a fee each time, according to Burrell. ""There are numerous cases of a single share being lent ten or many more times,"" giving rise to the complaint that the DTCC has been electronically counterfeiting just as was done via printed certificates before the Crash.""

Today, our spotlight is on another facet of tax haven abuses; we call it dividend tax abuse. And the focus today is not on U.S. citizens, but on non-U.S. citizens who are supposed

to be paying taxes on the dividends they receive from U.S. corporations but do not. They do not pay those taxes because major financial institutions like Lehman Brothers, Morgan

Stanley, Deutsche Bank, UBS, Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, and others have created financial gimmicks whose primary purpose is to enable clients to dodge U.S. taxes owed on U.S. stock dividends, but which are dressed up with phrases like \`dividend enhancement,'' \`\`yield enhancement,'' and even \`dividend uplift.'' Using stock swaps, stock loans, and exotic

financial instruments, the financial institutions have built a series of financial black boxes, surrounded by mind-numbing complexity, designed to keep their clients' money tax free.

***Accidentally Released – and Incredibly Embarrassing – Documents Show How Goldman Engaged in ‘Naked Short Selling***

The lawsuit between Overstock and the banks concerned a phenomenon called naked short-selling, a kind of high-finance counterfeiting that, especially prior to the introduction of new regulations in 2008, short-sellers could use to artificially depress the value of the stocks they’ve bet against. The subject of naked short-selling is a) highly technical, and b) very controversial on Wall Street, with many pundits in the financial press for years treating the phenomenon as the[ stuff of myths](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB114480254610823574.html?mod=opinion_main_featured_stories_hs) and conspiracy theories

Now, however, through the magic of this unredacted document, the public will be able to see for itself what the banks’ attitudes are not just toward the “mythical” practice of naked short selling (hint: they volubly confess to the activity, in writing), but toward regulations and laws in general.

***“Fuck the compliance area – procedures, schmecedures,” chirps Peter Melz, former president of Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp.*** (a.k.a. Merrill Pro), when a subordinate worries about the company failing to comply with the rules governing short sales.

***We also find out here how Wall Street professionals manipulated public opinion by buying off and/or intimidating experts in their respective fields. In one email made public in this document, a lobbyist for SIFMA, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, tells a Goldman executive how to engage an expert who otherwise would go work for “our more powerful enemies,” i.e. would work with Overstock on the company’s lawsuit.***

“He should be someone we can work with, especially if he sees that cooperation results in resources, both data and funding,” the lobbyist writes, “while resistance results in isolation.”

Thus in this document we have another former Merrill Pro president, Thomas Tranflia, saying in a 2005 email: “**We are NOT borrowing negatives… I have made that clear from the beginning. Why would we want to borrow them? We want to fail them.”**

Trafalia, in other words, didn’t want to bother paying the high cost of borrowing “negative rebate” stocks. Instead, he preferred to just sell stock he didn’t actually possess. That is what is meant by, “We want to fail them.” Trafalia was talking about creating “fails” or “failed trades,” any case, this document all by itself shows numerous executives from companies like Goldman Sachs Execution and Clearing (GSEC) and Merrill Pro talking about a conscious strategy of “failing” trades – in other words, not bothering to locate, borrow, and deliver stock within the time alotted for legal settlement. For instance, in one email, GSEC tells a client, Wolverine Trading, “We will let you fail.”

More damning is an email from a Goldman, Sachs hedge fund client, who remarked that when wanting to “short an impossible name and fully expecting not to receive it” he would then be “shocked to learn that \[Goldman’s representative\] could get it for us.”Meaning: when an experienced hedge funder wanted to trade a very hard-to-find stock, he was continually surprised to find that Goldman, magically, could locate the stock. Obviously, it is not hard to locate a stock if you’re just saying you located it, without really doing it.

***We got a kick out a brokerage firm's comment letter during the last ""short sales"" comment period back in 1999. In it this firm urged fellow DTCC participants to just hike up their fees for certificate delivery to thwart investors demanding proof of their purchase. This firm cited a 70% decrease in demands for delivery after doing this.***

The UBS-Credit Suisse Reg SHO Mystery For five years, including the entire period of the financial crisis, UBS placed tens of millions of short sale orders of stock it did not own, had not borrowed, had not contracted to borrow, and had not tried to borrow. Sometimes UBS marked these trades as “short sales,” sometimes as “long sales.” It placed these trades for its own accounts and for more than 270 of its clients. In so doing, UBS found more than 30 different ways to commit tens of millions of violations of SEC Regulation SHO. These were facts found by FINRA in its October 2011 settlement with UBS.28 None of the stock existed before UBS sold it. UBS had no license to create the stock. No public company had ever registered any of the stock with the SEC for sale to the public. None of the stock was included in the float of any public company. No board of directors had ever voted to issue a single share that UBS sold. Rather, these imaginary shares suddenly materialized with no corporate gestation period in the milliseconds or less it took for a computer to decide it was time to sell and execute the trade. In this way, UBS created counterfeit stock for five years when it placed tens of millions of orders in public companies whose number and identity remain unknown. And in this way, UBS artificially increased the supply of stock and artificially skewed the intersection of supply and demand curves, invariably lowering the execution price of the stock. The FINRA findings left many crucial questions unanswered. Who were the 270 UBS clients whose orders were traded in violation of Reg SHO? Why weren’t enforcement proceedings initiated against them? Who were the public companies victimized by UBS’s tens of millions of Reg SHO violations? Did UBS close short sales without borrowing the stocks? Were any of the public companies harmed by UBS’s tens of millions of violations? Were any public companies forced into bankruptcy? How did UBS get away with tens of millions of violations of Reg SHO for five years without being flagged by the SEC, FINRA, the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) or any of the exchanges where the trades were executed? Even more of a mystery, how did UBS circumvent Reg SHO for more than two years after the SEC had beefed it up with numerous amendments during the height of the 2008 financial crisis?

# The GameStop Mess Exposes the Naked Short Selling Scam

It’s a scam central to the stock trading system, enabled by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the market regulator, and the Depository Trust and Clearing Corp. (DTCC), the stock clearinghouse, to benefit the big players. The SEC has long been run by revolving-door officials who move between it and Wall Street trading houses and law firms. DTCC is owned by the prime brokers, such as Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and Citi, and run in their interests.

For anyone that has not heard of Patrick Byrne, the CEO of Overstock.com, where have you been? Mr. Byrne has become the champion of the fight against naked short selling over the past couple of years. Mr. Byrne started a blog back some time ago called[ DeepCapture.com](http://www.deepcapture.com/). In it, you can find some very interesting information, and the pictures he paints sound exactly like the story of Sirius XM. The following is a short snipped from[ an article by Mark Mitchell](http://www.deepcapture.com/a-bad-day-for-criminals-and-the-journalists-who-love-them/), a reporter/blogger from DeepCapture:

“This same clique of short-sellers has attacked dozens of other companies, almost always resorting to similar tactics: false “independent” research (dictated by the short-sellers, who trade ahead of it); harassment of targeted executives by thugs and criminals; scurrilous rumor-mongering; so-called “bashers” who are paid by the shorts to flood the Internet with smears and distortions; corporate espionage; government investigations (which are instigated by the shorts, and drain corporate resources, but usually end in no action); and bogus class action lawsuits (usually filed by a corrupt law firm called Milberg Weiss until Milberg’s top partners went to jail for bribing plaintiffs).”

A hugely disproportionate number of the companies that have been targeted by this clique of short-sellers have also been victimized by massive levels of phantom stock.

“False independent research”? Would this be Mr. Weinkes of GS? Or perhaps more publicized reporters such as Cramer and Cramer’s puppet Robert Holmes (who you may remember[ Homer took to task on his incorrect “research”](https://siriusbuzz.com/forum/showthread.php?t=771)).

Scurrilous rumor-mongering and so-called “bashers”? Yahoo Message Boards anyone? Comments on Seeking Alpha? “Anonymous Cowards” comments from other blogs and message boards?

Government investigations that drain corporate resources but usually end in no action? Could that be a reference to the options backdating investigation that XM was going through? And what if the NAB had the help of some of these naked shorters to squeeze every last day out of the FCC during the merger process?

Bogus class action lawsuits by none other than Milberg Weiss? Sounds like we hit the nail on the head here…

Massive levels of phantom stock? Perhaps some of you read my article entitled[ RegSho is a Joke](https://siriusbuzz.com/regsho-is-a-joke.php), where I pointed out that in order for Sirius XM to be placed on the RegSho list, a minimum of 15 million shares, or 30% of the day’s trades, had to fail to deliver? Sirius was on that RegSho list for 28 days straight as of the time of that writing. That would mean over the course of that time, a MINIMUM of 420,000,000 shares – almost half a Billion shares (representing 1/6th of their float) were phantom shares that never existed and were never delivered. How can a stock react “normally” when the market is flooded with half a billion shares that do not exist?

It seems that many companies are fighting back on their own. Of course Mr. Byrne is fighting for Overstock.com. In[ another article](http://www.deepcapture.com/fairfax-and-just-the-facts-maam/), Fairfax Financial Holdings is also filing a lawsuit alleging stock manipulation.

It has come time that Sirius XM needs to do the same thing. Mel needs to stand up for his investors and correct wrongs that are being done to his company. Obviously, we can help. There is[ a thread in the SiriusBuzz forums](https://siriusbuzz.com/forum/showthread.php?t=768) where you can obtain the contact information for the SEC as well as the New York Attorney General. It is time that the blatant manipulation of Sirius XM stock comes to a halt.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/wyhowu/dear_sec_the_bank_robbers_have_been_caught_and/,weregoingstreakin,2022-08-27 00:16:25,14296,Superstonk

*Plastic ""Razor"" used to cut the adhesive if any is sticking, may not be needed but helpful.

*If you are removing the faceplate I would also recommend getting new thermal paste to apply while it is open 

* Something I wish I would have had to remove the screen is [Ifixit makes a tool called Iopener](https://www.ifixit.com/products/iopener?variant=39371673763943) you heat this up in the microwave, set it on your screen, and it will loosen up the adhesive effortlessly. If not you will need heat but it's not fun.



Now if you have no experience with electronic tear down, my number one tip is TAKE YOUR TIME. When your removing screws apply straight downward pressure, and slowly turn. If the bit starts to slip out, stop. You might have the wrong bit. Double check and try again. Everything comes out relatively easily, except for the joycon rail screws. Also make sure you separate your screws for each step. Tip- If you are using the mako driver kit, I like to use the lid since it has plastic grid sections on it, and for every step that I do I will put each screw into a new grid starting from the top left and going across. And when I'm all done, I work my way backwards on each step and my screws always go right where they need to.

Here is the list of difficulty starting with the easiest to the hardest
* The back shell, I believe 7 screws was all that this was, plus no cables
*Joycon adapters 2 screws to open and you swap springs, rubber piece and metal rail. 
* The dock faceplate/dock led. Was less than 20 screws a ribbon cable and a small plug for the led. If doing both, do it at the same time, as you have to remove the led to change the dock
*The pro controller was just as simple as any other full sized controller 
* joycons is where it starts to get more serious it is a full teardown of all the pieces, again not terribly hard though, less than 10 screws each a couple ribbon cables, battery to unplug, and a few springs to remove, the trigger removal is the hardest part here. If your changing your LEDs only, it's about halfway through the teardown, you could change just the LEDs and it saves you from removing triggers and boards but still have to remove battery and a  ribbon cables. 
* The switch faceplate is by far the hardest, you disassemble almost the entirety of the console, and the screen removal is pretty nerve racking if you are inexperienced with removing screens. Tons of screws that you have to keep separate, some look identical with only a .1mm difference but it definitely matters where it goes back. If you have taken apart a new iphone, you could easily do this. If you haven't, don't worry neither have I, and not a single thing broke throughout. But if you do break the digitizer(the most likely piece to break)it is less than $30

**The back shell** [link](https://extremerate.com/products/clear-atomic-purple-console-back-plate-diy-replacement-housing-shell-case-for-nintendo-switch-console-with-kickstand-joycon-shell-not-included-zm505?_pos=5&_sid=0f884984d&_ss=r)
[Here is how to remove the back shell](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Nintendo+Switch+Rear+Panel+Replacement/112996)

Once the shell is off the kickstand is removed with a few screws and moved over to the new shell, when you remove, Immediately transfer to a new shell to not lose any pieces. With my kit the game cartridge cover was included with the faceplate so you may not have it if your doing just the backplate. When you install that, it is supposed to slide back and forth so don't over tighten it trying to make it stay still. 

**Joycon wrist strap adapters** [Link](https://extremerate.com/products/clear-atomic-purple-replacement-shell-for-nintendo-switch-joycon-strap-custom-joy-con-wrist-strap-housing-buttons-for-nintendo-switch-2-pack-uem505?_pos=1&_sid=0f884984d&_ss=r)

 I had a hard time finding a good guide, but these were fairly simple. Remove the Philips screws from the rail, remove the metal rail and set aside. The next  long plastic clip that was just under the metal will also be removed. The end that has the wrist strap protruding stays down, and lift from the other side. There should be a piece of rubber attached to that, remove and transfer to the new shell pieces. Then transfer the button springs, the wrist strap and lock. There is a spring by the wrist strap, remove and set to the side. Don't forget to transfer over the piece of clear plastic that transmits the led through it. If you want to make a custom strap now would be the time. I found zero guides on how to do this, so I cut the old strap, removed the wrist lock and transferred that to my new strap. The original has metal clamped to hold the strap in a loop, I tried to remove it to reuse, don't waste your time. The strap I used I held both ends in a pair of pliers with about 1/2 inch exposed right next to each other, take a lighter and once it started to melt took another pair of pliers and squeezed them together. Worked well enough for me, but some string/cord will not melt like that so your results may vary. Once the strap is taken care of, both new buttons have their springs inserted, and you've transferred the rubber piece you can now put back on the long plastic clip, remember the side on the strap is the one that gets inserted first with the small lock piece on the strap getting slid in place. Now you can drop the spring that you removed from next to the strap that I told you to set aside. It will drop right down through a hole into place. You can put it back sooner, but it just makes it harder. Finally put the metal rail back on a screw back in. If you need to reference something part way through unscrew the metal rail on the 2nd adapter and you should be able to see right away how to put it back together. 

**The dock and led**  [Dock link](https://extremerate.com/products/transparent-altomic-purple-custom-faceplate-for-nintendo-switch-charging-dock-soft-touch-grip-diy-replacement-housing-shell-for-nintendo-switch-dock-dock-not-included-fdm505) [LED link](https://extremerate.com/products/firefly-led-tuning-kit-for-nintendo-switch-joycons-dock-ns-joycon-sl-sr-buttons-ribbon-flex-cable-indicate-power-led-violet-joycons-dock-not-included-nsgzled007)

[Here is a video right from ExtremeRate ](https://youtu.be/mxqIfSmAm7M) in their videos they don't do any talking, So sometimes that is frustrating but with the dock it is pretty straightforward. It's just easy to follow him for the location of all the screws. They are all a Phillips bit I believe P00, this was my only exception to where I use a screwdriver that came with the kit. The iFixit screwdriver that I had was too thick at the body to reach all the way into the unit to get the screws. Just make sure you apply a decent amount of pressure but none of these screws are torqued down. Once you are down to the circuit board this is the first opportunity to use your plastic pry bar. On top of the ribbon cable is a plastic flap, usually black/grey/ or white. Get the front of your pry bar just under it and apply slight pressure and it will pop upwards and then the ribbon cable it just slightly sitting there. If you need pressure to remove the ribbon cable, you are doing something wrong and I would recommend [Watching this quick video on how to remove a ribbon cable. They are all varying sizes/shapes but the concept is the same for all ribbon cables. ](https://youtu.be/C9PwK9eGrCY). Now you will remove the other plug from the circuit board, DO NOT pull from the wires, get a set of needle nose pliers and pull from the connector itself, a little back and forth wiggling will help remove it. Continue to disassemble following the video. It is only a few more steps to disassemble, Then you just work your way backwards while building everything in the new shell. Do not forget to remove the piece of plastic where the LED light comes through from on the old dock Faceplate and transfer it to the new one. If you are putting in a new LED, you should be able to tell what thing is the LED when you have the replacement in front of you, but if not, it was the other thing plugged in besides the ribbon cable. Just reassemble with that LED and you will be all set. The only tip I have for reassembling is the ribbon cable is much easier if you have a long flat pair of tweezers. I only had one that only had the very tip touching each other and it made it hard to maneuver the ribbon cable, but only the dock ribbon cable was hard, none of the rest were quite as tough in terms of resistance. 

**Pro controller** [Link](https://extremerate.com/products/clear-atomic-purple-faceplate-backplate-handles-for-nintendo-switch-pro-controller-soft-touch-diy-replacement-grip-housing-shell-cover-for-nintendo-switch-pro-controller-not-included-frm505?_pos=3&_sid=0f884984d&_ss=r)

If you have every done any other controller this was just as simple as an Xbox 360 controller.  [The iFixit button replacement guide is what I used](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Nintendo+Switch+Pro+Controller+Buttons+-+D-Pad+Replacement/127790) follow the guide but instead rebuild it in your new shell and with your new buttons. This was fairly straightforward, just make sure your buttons are in the right direction. 



**Joycons and LED'S** [Joycon Link](https://extremerate.com/products/clear-atomic-purple-joycon-handheld-controller-housing-with-full-set-buttons-diy-replacement-shell-case-for-nintendo-switch-joy-con-console-shell-not-included-cm505?_pos=8&_sid=0f884984d&_ss=r)[LED link](https://extremerate.com/products/firefly-led-tuning-kit-for-nintendo-switch-joycons-dock-ns-joycon-sl-sr-buttons-ribbon-flex-cable-indicate-power-led-violet-joycons-dock-not-included-nsgzled007)

Start with the left joycon, there are less components in it. 
[The iFixit guide is what I used](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Nintendo+Switch+Left+Joy-Con+Shell+Replacement/130378) as you are able to, swap pieces to the new shell when disassembling. When removing the triggers I couldn't figure out what the guide was trying to get me to do, so I held the plastic behind the trigger, put my prybar under the lip on the side where your finger sits and popped it off that way. With the kit I had, the only thing I needed to save was the circuit board and springs, so I wasn't worried about breaking it. One mistake I made and didn't notice until after was somehow a direction button was upside down, even though they are notched to fit in certain spots I somehow messed it up.  Finally reassembling the trigger was one spot where I had issues. Make note of where the springs were removed and put them back in the same spots in the new shell right away.  Then reassemble the board and trigger so nothing falls out. Another problem spot on reassembling is the spring for the ""L"" bumper button, it is easy to put back together but easy to knock the spring out when putting the shell back on it. Once you put the battery compartment on, hold the shell tight so it doesn't separate and the spring will stay in place. If you shake it after assembling and hear something I bet it will be that spring. It happened to me on both joycons.

[Here is the right joycon](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Nintendo+Switch+Right+Joy-Con+Shell+Replacement/130386) it is nearly identical and if you have made it this far, you can probably do it without a guide. 

The LED replacements also came from ExtremeRate a direct board transfer and they were labeled for left and right, just swap it over along the way.

**The Faceplate** [Link](https://extremerate.com/products/clear-atomic-purple-diy-housing-shell-for-nintendo-switch-console-replacement-faceplate-front-frame-for-nintendo-switch-console-w-volume-up-down-power-buttons-console-not-included-vep311?_pos=11&_sid=06fe93b50&_ss=r)

If you struggled along the way, you might not want to do this. If the rest was no problem, ignore everyone else who says it's not worth it, because it is so worth it and it's not that much harder of a process than the rest. Just the screen is difficult. [If you haven't caught the trend by now, I again used the iFixit guide for this](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Nintendo+Switch+Front+Frame+Replacement/148737)  Everything is pretty straightforward in the guide, this is where it is super important that you separate your screws correctly. The screws that you will have an issue with are the joycon rails, make absolutely certain you have the right sized bit that is in good condition as well. I stripped one out, and luckily was able to force a large size on to get it out. You might not be so lucky. I had it laying face down on a towel on my table with the side you want to unscrew close to the edge, put my hand opposite the screws so it wouldnt slide and held it completely straight onto the screw with firm pressure. On my very last screw I started talking and had it angled and stripped it instantly. 

Now for the Screen, I learned about the IOpener the day I went to do the swap, and I didn't want to wait so I used my heat gun. Seriously if you have the couple extra dollars to spare for that get it. I will for sure use it on my next one. Just follow the guide If you do. If you are like me and have a hot air station I set it to my lowest (200 degrees) at about 75% air flow, follow the guide but you are going to have to heat it for longer. I did it at first for 60sec while going back and forth along 2 sides and tried to remove and it wouldn't budge. It wasn't until about 2 mins that the screen started to budge. Heat up, apply suction cup in the same spot the guide says(if not you will break ribbon cable) and pull, once there is a gap put in the pry bar or plastic pick. If you used the IOpener the whole side would come up easy. Otherwise you have to pry a little spot up heat up further down pry up there insert pick and keep going until your all the way around. Do not insert your pick too far, just enough to hold it or you could track dust under the screen and onto the lcd. If you noticed the adhesive is still connected like a stringy web to both parts use your plastic knife to help separate. Once the screen is removed, you are home free, everything from here on out will be so simple. If you can, remove the old adhesive, it's just like piece of tape, and reapply. If not you will need to order new, my switch is over 4 years old and it was still usable. Make it to the end of the guide and reassemble everything in the new faceplate. 

**Final thoughts**

Overall I would say any one at just about any skill level should be able to do everything up to the faceplate. Take your time and follow the guides. The LEDs in person look really good, the picture makes them appear way brighter than they are. The joycons stay about the same light level, the dock gets slightly brighter, but nothing dramatic. All the plastic except for the pro controller lined up great, the grips on the pro controller doesn't line up as perfect as the original but it is nothing to complain about. Would I do it again? Absolutely. Should you do it to your own switch? Absolutely, start in the order I said, and you will either have the confidence to finish it all, or will have a sweet dock and pro controller, and maybe even a set of joycons. Yes my background is also because my switch is modded and no I wont explain how to do that, sorry. The joycon controller grip is also 3d printed in a transparent purple and looks great in person with the color match, it's rather glossy though so it doesn't picture that well. Let me know of any other questions that you may have, but hopefully I was able to include all the info.",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/108qooy,nerdyswag16,2023-01-11 05:50:14,13777,NintendoSwitch
"r/Conservative dives into controversy after (only?) copies of ""damning Hunter Biden documents"" were allegedly stolen from the mail en-route to Fox News pundit Tucker Carlson. Is it a case of ""my dog ate my homework"", or 5D chess by ""the smartest man in DC""?","**tl;dr: Fox News host Tucker Carlson claims that a source mailed him massively incriminating documents about Joe Biden's son that would totally sway the election for Trump, but unknown actors stole the only copies of the proof from his mail. Even the sub** r/Conservative **is skeptical about this story, with some saying it's evidence that spies are frantically suppressing the truth, or it's a Tucker ruse to force Biden to a misstep; others saying it's the most obvious ""my dog ate my homework"" in political history.**

**UPDATE**: allegedly UPS found the missing package of “evidence” today, and Tucker [immediately announced that everyone should leave Hunter alone because Hunter is just a sad dude with drug problems.](https://www.thedailybeast.com/tucker-carlson-suddenly-says-its-time-to-leave-hunter-biden-alone)

Background: for anyone who hasn't been following the news, a week and some ago the New York Post broke the story that Hunter Biden, son of former VP and current presidential candidate Joe Biden, has been linked to serious crimes (at minimum corruption and bribery) by a laptop of his acquired under somewhat confused circumstances. Questions have emerged about the story, as supposedly it involves the California multi-millionaire Hunter dropping off several water-damaged Apple laptops at a tiny repair place at a strip mall in Delaware near Joe's home. The story is too complex to go into, but suspicious aspects include the shop owner is legally blind and can't guarantee it was indeed Hunter who dropped off the laptop, among other people he sent copies of the hard drive to Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, lots of odd twists. 

So those who are skeptical allege that in actuality, hackers (possibly foreign) stole legit emails and photos from Hunter's iCloud for credibility and then mixed in fake incriminating materials and then loaded them onto a hard drive so as to have a plausible background story without admitting to the hacking. On the opposite end, those who believe it's real are convinced this is the ""nuclear bomb"" that destroys Joe Biden and wins the election for Trump, and the story on fringe media and discussion has rapidly expanded from the HD showing evidence of corruption and bribery (including kickbacks to Joe), photos/videos of Hunter with sex workers and using drugs (which nobody denies he's done in the past), and moved deeper and deeper into claims the HD shows Hunter molesting his underage niece, and allegations it shows Hunter *literally* cannibalizing Chinese children.

**NOTE: do not do not do not link directly to any Hunter materials from Reddit, as at bare minimum they involve stolen personal intimate images, potentially show illegally-acquired hacked materials, and (probably not true but just to be safe) allegedly show crimes against minors. People linking to Hunter content from Reddit have been immediately and permanently banned, don't do it.**

For further context, just to address a common argument about Hunter (as neutrally as possible), while opponents say Hunter has received high paying jobs from foreign governments despite zero qualifications, to be fair he's a graduate of Yale Law School, was Executive VP at a US financial firm, worked on e-commerce programs at the US Department of Commerce, was appointed to the board of directors of Amtrak by President George W. Bush and became vice chairman, and has done a bunch of lobbying and investment activities. So it's totally fair to question the degree to which Hunter has leveraged his birth advantage, but it's also not like he was flipping burgers for crack money prior to this.

On to the popcorn: Fox News initially declined to cover the ""Hunter Biden bombshell"" or ""hard-drive from hell"" because Rudy Giuliani wasn't providing the metadata to confirm the contents are real. But some Fox News hosts *were* willing to report on the fact that the New York Post is talking about it. Tucker Carlson claims his sources in Washington DC obtained absolutely verifiable documents and mailed them to his Los Angeles office, and the package was intercepted and the documents removed. r/Conservative falls to debating how plausible this story is over a number of posts tonight:

"Riot's new 'direction' where they're exclusively rewarding premades is so alienating to lonely kids, and it breaks my heart.","So a few hours ago I noticed the MSI rewards announcement and found that *yet again* Riot is rewarding those who play in premades while denying solo players any sort of bonus, even a smaller one. This is the most recent instance of them doing this sort of IP reward scheme in a trend of them doing this for a year and a half, and that's not even getting into the other ways playing in premades is being rewarded (dynamic queue and hextech loot, to name a few). And it's really starting to grate on me because it's unbelievable that Riot keeps deliberately alienating what I suspect is a considerable share of their playerbase like this.

I've been playing Season 1, at which point I was a sophomore in high school. My entire schooling life I was a pretty damn lonely kid. For a variety of reasons, my quiet demeanour, being a small guy for my age, being gay I was picked on and had a hard time making friends. And I *was* miserable about it (didn't help that I was diagnosed with depression in my junior year, which left me more miserable and also inhibited my desire to even try to make friends) so I turned to video games, specifically league to get me through it. The game was the perfect band-aid fix for what I was going through - it was immersive enough to distract me from my frankly depressing personal life but more importantly, for a good 30-50 minutes at a time I could get matched up with a bunch of strangers who I could talk to, share a common interest with (the game) and play with. I'm not going to pretend that solo queue isn't toxic, it can be, but it didn't so much bother me because I was used to harassment in real life and honestly, it's a lot less damaging when it comes from some random in a game you'll never see again vs someone you dealt with at school 5 days a week, but it was the cool people I ran into, that gave me compliments or told jokes or just left me with positive experiences, that made league the perfect means to get by. Even if I didn't get to enjoy a 40-minute-friend in a game, it still made my days a lot better than they were before I discovered league because hey, the game is fun, the game doesn't care at all that I'm 5'2'' and have no real life friends, it still gives me something to feel good about when I win. I've since graduated my hell-hole of a high school and did finally manage to make a couple of friends and even found a boyfriend, but I think a lot about how in high school, I felt like I'd never get here and league of legends got me through that. It was a haven for a sad lonely kid like me.

And I bet, I'm not the only one. 

It's probably not something people are willing to talk about much on Reddit because of the pressure to act unflappable, but I'm willing to hedge a bet there's tons of miserable, lonely youths playing this game because its design is ideal for people looking for an escape from that situation. Or *was* ideal - when Riot continues to reward people for playing with friends and give solo players nothing, it's a slap in the face for people in the position I was in. Now before you say ""well maybe you should just go make friends then"" realize that it isn't actually as simple, there's a variety of reasons people without friends have trouble making them, least of all the fact that being treated as crap makes you so untrusting of people that you don't want to bother anymore, or that when you're someone who gets bullied, others are reluctant to associate with you out of fear of the same treatment. It's an inescapable spiral, sometimes. It's not like people don't want to make friends, some people just can't and hey, if you're in that situation and you're miserable, then there's nothing wrong with finding another outlet, find something that doesn't punish you for not having friends. League used to be just that, until Riot keeps finding ways to make that game send the exact same message - ""if you have no friends, your life isn't worth rewarding"". And knowing what league meant to me at a shitty time, that's sort of heartbreaking.

I'm not saying take out premade rewards, okay sure I get it - it's a business strategy to get more people to play league, riot is a business yada yada - but don't just slap ""0%"" next to what you get for playing this game by yourself. I'll bet my ass there's depressed teenagers who couldn't sleep so they spent all night grinding out games during the MSI event - or going back further, the pool party one last year - only to get zilch because they're alone. Your 'incentives' aren't going to make these people suddenly go out and magically make friends so they'll start playing your game, it's going to turn them away from something that would have otherwise been pretty nice for them. And that's a damn shame.

tl;dr Riot are alienating a good chunk of their playerbase - perhaps those who need some acceptance most - and it doesn't feel good.",https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/4jrkvg/riots_new_direction_where_theyre_exclusively/,irl_annie,2016-05-17 20:53:20,12637,leagueoflegends

2022: Year of the MOASS \[8 Reasons Why **∞** Soon\]

§1: RC's BBBY Call Options

§2: Indicators \[Primarily Utilization\]

§3: The Algorithm

§4: Market Crash

§5: Stock Split Dividend

§6: NFT Marketplace

§7: DRS

§8: DOJ Investigations

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**§1:** **RC's BBBY Call Options**

1 month ago, RC purchased not only a significant amount of BBBY shares, but also a significant amount of call options, as per SEC Schedule 13D Filing from RC Ventures:

Under ITEM 3,

“The aggregate purchase price of the 7,780,000 Shares directly owned by RC Ventures is approximately $119,376,296, excluding brokerage commissions. **The aggregate purchase price of the call options exercisable into 1,670,100 Shares owned directly by RC Ventures is approximately $1,785,263, excluding brokerage commissions.**”

Here’s more details on the options he purchased:

https://preview.redd.it/2n101ksyanw81.png?width=1339&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d58a23720b26ca121cd028b593a71feabc0a5c0

https://preview.redd.it/i16wwmwzanw81.png?width=1341&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae8d3e0be4a22770d7a95017b7a9a252c6b6d4bf

Call options varying from $60-$80, expiring January 2023.

This means that RC is betting that the price of BBBY will surpass $80 anywhere from now till January, 2023. These are the furthest OTM options that he could buy (meaning that the highest price he could bet the stock was going to surpass was $80, and he purchased those contracts).

The price of BBBY stock at the time of recording is around $15, meaning that for RC’s $60 calls to go ITM, the price of BBBY would need to increase 301%+ its current price (and increase 434%+ for the $80 call options). For this to happen, there’d need to be a January 2021-type run up, which is not possible anymore without igniting MOASS. In other words, RC is betting MOASS before January, 2023. However, due to theta decay on options contracts, **RC is most likely anticipating MOASS to happen way before January, 2023 (likely sometime around mid-2022)**, which would be around the time of the NFT Marketplace/Stock-Split Dividend, which makes sense.

Also, if we further ponder why RC would go with BBBY contracts instead of GME contracts, it makes perfect sense. RC is the type of guy to only want to either HOLD or HODL his GME shares. I doubt he’ll be interested in selling any GME shares during MOASS, as to not inhibit the legendary event. But, if he wanted to collect profits on the MOASS, he could sell his BBBY options instead. BBBY, being one of the basket stocks attached to GME’s price, will squeeze once the MOASS launches, and so RC could turn his million dollar options position with BBBY into billions in profits, selling those contracts and collecting billions without messing with the MOASS directly. A brilliant play.

**§2:** **Indicators \[Primarily Utilization\]**

I’ve always considered utilization (percentage of shares available to borrow that have been lent) to be an important factor for determining our proximity to a squeeze. When I was primarily focused on αmc during the first half of 2021, one of the big factors I looked for was utilization, so when utilization hit 100% in May, I knew some significant price movement to the upside was going to come. It only took a few weeks after 100% utilization for the stock to go up 600% afterwards. Did MOASS ignite? No. That, to me, was merely FOMO, which took the basket stocks, along with GME, to critical levels in June that SHFs did everything they could to suppress the price (from getting their pals to dump shares, to stock halts, etc.). We should note, however, that utilization was at 100% for only a few weeks.

In the Social Science Research Network's “Short Squeezes and Their Consequences”, Schultz states ""I find that the likelihood of squeezes is very low for most stocks. The risk of a squeeze becomes important when stocks are hard-to-borrow. Utilization, that is the proportion of shares available to lend that are currently on loan, has a strong positive correlation with the probability of a short squeeze. If utilization is high and a share loan is recalled, it is difficult to find a new source of shares. I find that for the majority of stocks that have low utilization rates, an all lender short squeeze appears about once every 40 years. For stocks with very high utilization of 90% or more, an all lender squeeze occurs about once every 11 days.""

This goes in line with what I witnessed with αmc on May-June, 2021.

However, in the case today, GME has been at 100% utilization for 50+ consecutive trading days, which is big.

For reference, utilization was at 100% for about 90 consecutive trading days, leading to the January, 2021 run up.

https://preview.redd.it/b5nm75ksanw81.png?width=692&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ec5e6c6a33e32702212dd7b1fa0e8f6d71c9950

Now it looks like we’re repeating that same pattern:

https://preview.redd.it/yr9qlg2wanw81.png?width=911&format=png&auto=webp&s=44ba40e7425436085f781262e470e4540e1ce950

For utilization to be at 100% for so long at this point tells us that the spring is loading up for something BIG, and whatever is coming is going to explode like nobody’s ever seen before. The January run up in 2021 was pure FOMO. That can’t happen anymore. If GME explodes past critical margin levels, MOASS begins (legitimate short positions closing) and that 100x run up from August 2020-January 2021 will be peanuts compared to what’s coming.

Note: I’m not saying that the current utilization will emulate the January, 2021 utilization data. It could easily take longer than 90 consecutive trading days, but every trading day at 100% utilization adds to the pressure which will inevitably make the price erupt into a nuclear MOASS. Another few months of consecutive 100% utilization alone will make the price of GME substantially harder to control.

There's also other strong indicators that lit up, such as the supertrend indicator. The weekly supertrend indicator went bullish 4 weeks ago. Last time it was bullish was in February, 2021.

https://preview.redd.it/skom8hy1bnw81.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ae047aeeead5d6afdbbbccef436741bb7feca5e

Due note that when the weekly supertrend flipped bullish pre-January, 2021, several months went by until the January run up happened. This indicator, by no means, infers that a big price jump will happen within a short period of time, but that a strong run up in the price may occur sometime between now and several months from now.

There's also other long-term indicators that flipped bullish several weeks back, but they aren't nearly as important as utilization. TA is mostly useless when it comes to a manipulated stock. There's only a few indicators that actually hold some significance to me, and even then, are not indicative of anything happening immediately.

The most important indicator here is utilization, which may take several months for the price to react to, and ultimately pass margin levels, launching MOASS.

**§3:** **The Algorithm**

As I've said before, I consider TA to be mostly useless. This is primarily because Technical Analysis is used to predict ""natural price movements"". Well...there's nothing natural about GME's price movement. This is a heavily manipulated stock, so trying to predict natural trends of a heavily manipulated stock is counterintuitive.

I've previously seen TA posts from Apes saying things, such as ""bull flag forming, moon soon"" or ""inverted head and shoulders pattern, we're gonna run"". This is silly. I mean, just think about it logically. You really think a SHF manager manipulating GME is gonna be like ""OH SHIT, everybody, look, there's a bull flag forming on GME! We're screwed! We're gonna lose control of the price, and have to close all our short positions now! NoooOOOO!!!""?

Miss me with that BS lmao. If anything, SHFs create fake bullish patterns just to get day traders to buy short term options thinking there will be a price jump on a certain date, only to get rekt when SHFs drop the price and collect their sweet premium money to help live another day.

I care very little about TA. What I DO care about is the $100 million algorithm these institutions use to manipulate the price.

The algorithm is used to optimize the best strategies for SHFs, for example, to determine how long they can feasibly keep the price down until they have to let it run a bit (due to rollover periods, etc.). Ergo, the algorithm can maximize the effectiveness of 'can-kicking', but eventually it comes to a point where the most strategic choice would be to let the price run a few weeks before shorting again.

What happened on January, 2021 was a scenario that overpowered the algorithm. The algorithm didn’t say “hey, GME needs to go from $4 to $400+ by January, 2021”. That’s not how it works. It was slated to allow a gradual increase at the time, but got overpowered and taken over by retail FOMO. In January, retail regained control of the stock and took away control from the algo, up until the shutdown of the buy button where SHFs not only recalibrated the algo, but all piled in to double down on their short positions by shorting the shit out of GME as soon as the buy button got shut off.

Regardless of any recalibrations from SHFs, their algorithm is designed to maximize profits, and at some point, the algo has to let there be a significant price increase and face a (say) 60% risk of tripping up and initiating MOASS rather than a 95% risk of initiating MOASS by burning through cash at an exponential rate, ultimately facing margin calls. Cost to borrow is an example. Cost to borrow was increasing at an exponential rate. Had they not allowed a price increase, the rate could've continued, eventually burning through their cash at an astounding speed. Every time that they allow a small run up to happen, however, they risk losing control of the price and ultimately initiating MOASS, which is why I'm curious to know how high of an algorithmic jump SHFs will have to deal with in the future.

The closest algorithm I could find that best emulated GME's algorithm (in past time; hence, basket stocks not included) is BRN.AX (Brainchip Holdings).

For comparison, this is GME's chart:

https://preview.redd.it/7sacl6b4bnw81.png?width=1149&format=png&auto=webp&s=df8a73984de8b02924e90916b839a05d4008f5d3

This is BRN's chart:

https://preview.redd.it/wb3y6585bnw81.png?width=1187&format=png&auto=webp&s=cbf2d535a37f8ff405e58a65bf8cd7bf074dbd1d

The similarities are striking. BRN's ""January run"" happened on September, 2020; hence, it's technically ahead of GME by around 5 months, which would allow us to see a possible glimpse into the future, based on the algorithm.

I wanted to dig deeper by deriving a correlation coefficient, so I crunched up the price movement data and this is what I got:

https://preview.redd.it/t6oz5st6bnw81.png?width=579&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfeb824d8776fd4aff54faf6b24041ee1279ac3d

https://preview.redd.it/5evg6ea8bnw81.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=4398dfba3c7d23db04063d731d561dfbae7fb1af

**A general correlation of around .4**, which is actually considered a [moderate positive correlation](https://www.tastytrade.com/concepts-strategies/correlation).

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Methodology:

I used Yahoo Finance to extract BRN's historical data (from September 2, 2020 to September 2, 2021) as well as GME's historical data (from January 21, 2021 to January 21, 2022). Combined the data sets in an excel spreadsheet, analyzed, and extrapolated the correlation coefficient based on each respective stock's price movements within each historical timeframe. [More information of the code used to extrapolate Pearson's product-moment correlation](https://imgur.com/a/kLBvlqZ).

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Considering how complex these $100 million algorithms are, I recognize that extrapolating a correlation coefficient between these two stocks by analyzing a general/ambiguous factor, such as price movement, might not yield the most definitive results.

We can opt to take a rudimentary approach on extrapolating the correlation coefficient by instead analyzing the specific outliers (i.e. the strong periodic runs in price).

Circled below are the focal points we'll be comparing to extrapolate a correlation.

https://preview.redd.it/jurbeyz9bnw81.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d5084c225031ddc140bdc8b53d2f22e2505b43c

Taking these easily identifiable peaks, the dates between each stock's peak, and inputting the data into the Pearson correlation coefficient formula shown below,

https://preview.redd.it/8lail7bbbnw81.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&s=21aba05fc5c0f216d67301df316734568b0031f5

**We can obtain a correlation of around .8 or more**, which is considered a strong positive correlation.

Note: The results aren't going to be ideally precise, as it depends what what crests/dates you end up using as your variables. For example, you could take slightly different dates in proximity to the crests, or use other smaller focal points you'd prefer in the data instead. Hence, the results could vary slightly, but the overall positive correlation is there. I've permutated the data using two different sets of focal points, and still came out with a (conservatively) moderate-to-strong positive correlation overall, which means that **we can indeed use BRN's chart to get a better understanding of what the future holds for GME.**

As I've stated before, GME is 5 months behind BRN, which means that the big spike you saw in BRN's January, 2022 chart would be algorithmically slated to happen to GME around the summer. HOWEVER, this is not a perfect correlation. Conservatively speaking here, we have a moderate correlation, meaning that there could be a variety of other factors that could delay that part in the algorithm, possibly prolonging a run up of that magnitude many more months out. It's important to proceed with caution, as to balance your expectations. Nevertheless, I see GME's algorithm slated to eventually have the giant run up in price sometime this year comparable to what BRN had in the beginning of this year, and as we already know, a run up of that magnitude will open the doors to extreme FOMO and uncontrollable price action, ultimately leading to: MOASS.

**§4:** **Market Crash**

Speaking of algorithms, let’s talk about the algorithmic movement of the S&P 500.

There’s only so much that the government/institutions can do to artificially inflate the market until the inevitable crash comes, and it appears that time is approaching soon.

I came across a post by Ape ""choochoomthfka"", who analyzed and compared the current S&P 500 price movements with that of 2008 and discovered algorithmic correlations that are pointing to a possible crash around the end of May, and just like the VW squeeze that came soon after the 2008 crash, the GME MOASS would come soon after the 2022 crash.

His statement: “I’ve independently confirmed the S&P chart overlay of 2008 & today for myself. The similarity is indeed striking, but I just wanted to alert apes to the fact that the progression is \~4.4x faster today than in 2008. If indeed similar, the big crash is \~May 20th and the squeeze \~May 25th.”

https://preview.redd.it/guhhw5vdbnw81.png?width=699&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed1b39c3007eca21cd1adcc8cacaac4de103cc2a

This also goes in line with what we're seeing with the Buffet Indicator:

https://preview.redd.it/1bhhp0afbnw81.png?width=891&format=png&auto=webp&s=62827e2648f87f9704cb77d55713dca5d8021d19

Now, although I agree that the current S&P price is likely being algorithmically controlled (via PPT, institutions, etc.), I don’t want to promote dates. The truth is that we aren’t entirely sure when the crash will happen. With a very strong confidence interval, I could say it will happen this year, but to say it will happen exactly near the end of May, I cannot. There can easily be wide standard deviations associated with these market algorithms that prevent us from pinpointing an exact date. For all we know, there’s unaccounted variables that could allow the algorithm to delay the market crash another 3 or 4 months after May. The algorithm simply optimizes the most strategic move. That’s all. If the S&P can no longer afford to be can kicked longer than June, the algorithm will signal and allow for the market to finally crash in June. However, if an externality shows up and changes the variables, it could delay things.

All I’m saying is don’t get attached to specific dates. Nevertheless, the S&P 500 is following a similar pattern to 2008 that indicates a high likelihood of a market crash for 2022. As you may know, a market crash begets extreme loss in collateral for SHFs, triggering margin calls, and as such, MOASS. It’s important to note, though, that similarly to VW, GME might initially drop in tandem with a market crash, only taking off in the opposite direction as soon as shorts start closing their positions, due to failure to meet a margin call.

Federal rate hikes, China’s real estate market conundrum, 8.5% inflation rate (as of March, 2022), unprecedented records of margin debt, exponential increase in mortgage-backed security failures, spikes in credit default swaps, the Feds cracking down on unsustainable overleveraged positions from hedge funds, regulatory agencies/clearing corporations filing rules preparing for defaulting members, etc., are all additional signs adding to a likely market crash this year.

**§5:** **Stock Split Dividend**

I explained this in my [Checkmate](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/txnwhu/checkmate/) DD, so I won’t be going over it too much here.

Basically, a 7:1 stock split (in the form of a dividend) would likely lead to MOASS, due to the fact that SHFs can’t come up with 6 times the amount of synthetics that they produced over the entirety of GME’s life within a relatively short time frame. This is why TSLA ran like crazy after they proposed their stock split dividend. Even if there was some sort of hidden loophole that they exploited, post-split dividend, we can expect FOMO (buying/DRS’ing pressure) to increase substantially, due to a significantly more affordable price.

**§6:** **NFT Marketplace**

The NFT Market was valued at $40 billion in 2021, [per Chainalysis Inc. report](https://content.techgig.com/technology-unplugged/nft-market-touched-40-billion-in-2021-new-estimate-shows/articleshow/88773041.cms).

Considering GameStop’s market cap is valued at $10 billion, there’s a lot of potential revenue GameStop can tap into by entering this market. Not only that, but as time goes on and crypto/NFTs become more globalized, the NFT Market can easily exponentially increase in valuation, similarly to how Bitcoin did when it started getting adopted by institutions internationally as a store of value.

OpenSea, currently the world’s largest NFT Marketplace, is valued over $13 billion, [according to Sephton at “CoinMarketCap Alexandria”](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/opensea-now-has-a-valuation-of-13-3-billion).

Yet, the OpenSea NFT Marketplace is incommensurable to the soon to be GME NFT Marketplace, due to a variety of reasons:

1. OpenSea has extremely high gas fees, which deter business/revenue through their services and creates dead weight loss.
2. Weak security protocols. They have tons of vulnerabilities in their code that make them susceptible to attacks/thefts. Many examples in the past of OpenSea users suing the Marketplace for letting their NFTS get stolen by cyber thieves due to their “security vulnerabilities”.
3. GameStop gets nearly 1,000x more organic traffic via search engines than OpenSea does.

GME succeeds where OpenSea fails, by utilizing its partnerships with Loopring & Immutable X to eliminate high gas fees as well as reinforce security, using Ethereum’s security rather than Polygon’s (etc.). GameStop’s NFT Marketplace will not only supersede, but augment the NFT Market as the dominant NFT Marketplace.

That being said, GME’s market cap is already $10 billion. Say they get in the NFT Market in the summer and hit a valuation just half that of OpenSea this year. GME would end up with a high enough valuation putting itself past a $200 price. Maintaining a GME price past $200 would obliterate critical margin levels at this point, initiating MOASS.

In case you haven’t noticed, something very big is gearing up this year, and I don’t think RC bought extremely OTM BBBY calls this year just for the fun of it.

Very large partnerships with blue chip companies may be revealed upon implementation of the GME NFT Marketplace, and I believe we saw hints of it back in February:

https://preview.redd.it/d28t4wdhbnw81.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9cc8c25a664c6db7833837ccefcd03420bf6a23

I’m going to end with this: there were tons of complaints (likely from shills) that RC has been so secretive about the NFT Marketplace. If you have something REALLY good on your hands, are you going to go out and tell everyone? No. You wait until the time is right to present it. Companies that don’t have anything good on their hands will be all talk, nothing much to present. The talking would come to just fluff their position and provide a façade to investors. RC is the exact opposite personality. This project has been in the works for the past year, and I genuinely believe when it delivers that it will exceed expectations.

This NFT Marketplace, once implemented (and any additional hidden partnerships announced), could be a very big driver for FOMO soon after, ultimately breaking shorts’ banks and kickstarting MOASS.

**§7:** **DRS**

I've explained this before in §3 of my [We Are Unstoppable](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/t3zp4h/we_are_unstoppable/) DD. The Price Suppression Quandary.

""If the price of GME exceeds a certain point, margin calls will ensue, starting a snowball effect which will lead to MOASS. The more they short, the more money they lose, the more margin requirements pose a problem to them, and the more they will need a lower price.

Now, if the price of GME declines too low, as I’ve demonstrated in “§ 1: Relentless Dip Buying”, Apes will double, triple, quadruple, etc., their ability to buy up the float and register it.

Example: Let’s say, at the price of $120, it will take 10 months to lock 100% of the float. If SHFs decrease the price to $60, it will now take 5 months to lock 100% of the float. $30? 2.5 months. $15? A little over a month. By taking the price down so much, they effectively accelerate their demise, which is why they need a higher price.

This is also not including any outside entities purchasing the dip (e.g. institutions, pension funds, or even angel investors, such as RC, Musk, etc.).""

This is at the basic level. In reality, a price at $40 or below could technically allow GameStop to lock up the rest of the float themselves with their cash on hand, so it would immediately be game over if SHFs tried to pull off something like that. The more time that goes on, however, the less and less room SHFs have to breathe. Their margin call threshold is getting tighter each month that goes by. For example, back in June, their critical margin levels were around $350, meaning a sustained underlying close above $350 would've likely have led to margin calls/MOASS. As several months have gone by and they've burnt through so much cash with the stock that's only been getting harder to short every month, the critical margin levels that would beget margin calls now lies around $200-$210, which is why GME was halted around $200 this March, and SHFs threw everything they had once trading resumed in an attempt to regain control of the price. Their situation will continue to get more difficult as the number of registered shares increases.

Every share DRS'ed crunches down the float of available shares, and strengthens the bullish indicators. SHFs cannot sustain this indefinitely, as the pressure of DRS'ed shares continues to build until an eventual snap of the algorithm, taking Apes straight to the moon.

**§8:** **DOJ Investigations**

When GameStop's 10Q came out on December 8, 2021, for the first time, this came up (pg. 14):

https://preview.redd.it/btsr9vtibnw81.png?width=781&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e103a2d053782050d40d36b58424341919a7f4d

A few days after that was published, this happened:

https://preview.redd.it/f2wj9frjbnw81.png?width=1329&format=png&auto=webp&s=29028b506fe0430f060a38d55361f5b08683b241

Now, is it a coincidence that the DOJ immediately [launched a criminal investigation](https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/us-doj-launches-expansive-probe-into-short-selling-bloomberg-news-2021-12-10/) into SHFs soon after GameStop's 10Q published, showing registered shares from Apes? Maybe, maybe not. But, I've talked about this happening way before the DOJ even launched an investigation.

From my past DD [Mountains of GME Synthetic Shares](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/qxljfb/the_numbers_are_in_mountains_of_gme_synthetic/):

“I expect the closer we get to locking 100% of the float, the stronger the pressure the government will feel to taking initiative themselves, as once the float is 100% locked, there's no going back, and the entire world will witness the synthetics shitshow that will reveal itself and completely undermine the market's regulatory bodies. Moreover, as we also get closer to locking up the float, shorting GME back down will be a lot more costly and difficult for SHFs to do, which is why it's highly likely to me that the MOASS will start before the entire float gets locked up.”

I strongly believe that the DOJ has had enough of SHFs putting the economy in jeopardy, and that is self-evident with their race to begin indictments before the float gets locked.

[From the Washington post recently](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/04/27/bill-hwang-arrest-archegos/):

https://preview.redd.it/pbxboo9lbnw81.png?width=683&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6fe64adceb96f8c49ecad91fc62dcbfd8cbe4c1

Hwang isn't the only one. I urge Apes to read into [the DOJ's press release a few days ago](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/four-charged-connection-multibillion-dollar-collapse-archegos-capital-management). It's got really juicy info. Other indictments include Patrick Halligan, Archegos' CFO (charged with racketeering/fraud). Also, co-conspirators Scott Becker and William Tomita were indicted. If the judge were to throw the book at them, they'd practically end up with life in prison.

I want to share excerpts of the DOJ's press release here, just because it's so good:

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“We allege that these defendants and their co-conspirators lied to banks to obtain billions of dollars that they then used to inflate the stock price of a number of publicly-traded companies,” said U.S. Attorney Williams. “The lies fed the inflation, and the inflation led to more lies. Round and round it went. **In one year, Hwang allegedly turned a $1.5 billion portfolio and pumped it up into a $35 billion portfolio. But last year, the music stopped. The bubble burst. The prices dropped. And when they did, billions of dollars of capital evaporated nearly overnight.**”

\[...\]

**Today’s charges highlight our commitment to making sure the investment arena remains free from fraudulent activity of all kinds.**”  

\[...\]

**Last year, when the prices fell, Hwang’s positions were sold off and he could no longer manipulate the prices, and billions of dollars of capital evaporated nearly overnight.**

\[...\]

**The indictment further alleges that in order to get the billions of dollars Archegos needed to sustain this market manipulation scheme,** **Hwang and his co-conspirators lied to and misled some of Wall Street’s leading banks about how big Archegos’s investments had become, how much cash Archegos had on hand and the nature of the stocks that Archegos held. As alleged, they told those lies so that the banks would have no idea what Archegos was really up to, how risky the portfolio was, and what would happen if the market turned.**

As alleged, just over a year ago, the market turned and the stock prices Hwang and his co-conspirators had artificially inflated crashed, **causing immense damage to U.S. financial markets and ordinary investors.** In a matter of days, the companies at the center of Archegos’s trading scheme lost more than $100 billion in market capitalization, Archegos owed billions of dollars more than it had on hand, and Archegos collapsed. Market participants who purchased the relevant stocks at artificial prices lost the value they believed their investments held, the banks lost billions of dollars, and Archegos employees, many of whom were required to invest 25% or more of their bonuses with Archegos as deferred compensation, lost millions of dollars.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a very big deal. It's also definitive proof that SHFs lie about how much money they've been making by overly inflating their positions.

I remember in the past, sometimes shills would post articles that said ""Kenny made 'x' amount of money recently,"" or ""this month was such a profitable month for 'x' SHF. Apes aren't making a dent on SHFs' portfolios!"" I knew it was all BS. But then those same shills try to gaslight you, saying things like ""oh, you're against reality"" or ""get back to the real world"". Well, this is the real world, bitches. The DOJ indicted this financial terrorist for racketeering, fraud, and artificially inflating his positions. Moreover, our decision to call these guys financial terrorists is completely warranted. The DOJ literally just stated in the press release, I quote, ""the market turned and the stock prices Hwang and his co-conspirators had artificially inflated crashed, causing immense damage to U.S. financial markets and ordinary investors"". Financial terrorism defined.

Also in February, it was revealed that among the many SHFs the DOJ is investigating include Melvin Capital as well as Citron Research. Melvin Capital recently issued an apology to its investors and has been doing shady things to hide from their past.

Usually, the DOJ goes for the less significant ones first, once they catch a few rats that snitch, they can then work their way up the chain and expand the investigation.

A lot of shady, unexplained behavior has happened since the DOJ investigation has gone on, from buildings burning down rumored to have in possession documents related to criminal misdeeds of brokers/SHFs, to executives inexplicably stepping down from Citadel and other institutions.

After Michael Bodson recently announced he's stepping down from his position as President of the DTCC, along with billionaire Archegos owner, Bill Hwang, being indicted, I made this comment trying to connect the dots as to why these big players are now hiding from their past and/or stepping down from their positions:

https://preview.redd.it/5wly0a7nbnw81.png?width=679&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4ae87f503ca7153ac82c77775847599aa826e2c

According to [computershared.net](https://computershared.net/), nearly 35% of the float has been locked by Apes within 8 months \[September, 2021-April, 2022\], and over 70% of ALL outstanding shares have been locked.

The fact that over 70% of all outstanding GME shares have been locked should be raising alarm bells for the gov., which would explain why serious action is being taken now. If the DOJ's data scientists determine there's a too high risk of the float potentially getting locked by the end of the year, they will initiate MOASS before then. If they have to shut down Citadel and force close positions before all the shares get registered, they will. They're not standing idly by while 100% of the float gets locked. Financial terrorists like Kenneth Cordele Griffin are threatening the stability and longevity of the entire U.S financial market, and consequently, the global economy. Kenny & Co. are a threat to national security, a threat that will be neutralized by the DOJ before they let the float get 100% locked.

"Open Letter to the SEC, CFTC, FINRA, Members of the Financial Industry, and any Honest Journalist Regarding Systemically Destabilizing Risks In Today's Market","To whom it may concern,

&#x200B;

I have a thesis supported by evidence that systemically destabilizing risks currently exist in the US financial market. I am writing this open letter to call attention to these risks as the open exposure can result in catastrophic and uncontainable losses throughout the financial system. I have experience managing financial risk on an institutional level to give credibility to these claims. I am not a financial advisor. The rest of this letter will be describing a historical comparison to GME and certain dynamics of option trading in GME over the last two weeks. I will provide evidence substantiating my thesis and the supporting claims.

&#x200B;

First, I would like to call attention to the history of Overstock (NASDAQ:OSTK). Similar to the recent trading in GME, over a decade ago OSTK was a heavily shorted stock with persistent failure to delivers (FTDs). OSTK was the target of manipulative and illegal short selling made possible by regulatory loopholes and abusive option trades known as ""married puts"" and ""reverse conversions"". Economist John Welborn of The Haverford Group published a detailed [study on Oct 9, 2007](https://www.deepcapture.com/wp-content/uploads/2007.10.09-J-Welborn-Married-Puts-and-Reverse-Conversions.pdf) highlighting abuses of exceptions to SEC Reg SHO where deceptive trading deemed as bona-fide by market makers enabled ""naked"", unborrowed shorting of OSTK. Evidence is provided showing market makers engaged in non bona-fide speculation leaving open position exposure. This was made possible through married puts and reverse conversion trades. The study describes these trades as the following -

>"" *In a married put, a short seller purchases put options from an options market maker who then \[naked\] shorts the same amount of stock back to the short seller as a hedge. If the stock sold is not a threshold security, then the options market maker may fail and never deliver. A married put can be disguised as a market-neutral reverse conversion.""*

&#x200B;

Over the last year, the trading in GME stock has had many similarities to the trading activity in OSTK between 2004-2007. These similarities include large and persistent FTDs, high short interest, and suspicious option trading likely tied to married put and reverse conversion trades. For instance, after Robinhood and other brokers took unprecedented action in January to restrict their customers ability to buy GME and other equities, public documents from class action lawsuits show GME had short interest as a percentage of float as [high as 226.42%](https://www.rosenlegal.com/media/casestudy/2289_Robinhood%20-%20Initial%20Complaint%20-%20Market%20Manipulation%204835-8623-1514%20v.2.pdf) on Jan 15, 2021.

&#x200B;

There are still more questions than answers around the events of late January 2021, especially after recordings of [Robinhood's Vlad Tenev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aicDIMtVld8) surfaced contradicting what he said under oath to Congress in February 2021. While payment for order flow has come under scrutiny, nothing has addressed the conflicts of interest or suspicions of collusion caused by Robinhood's relationship with Citadel. The [59 Regulatory Disclosures](https://files.brokercheck.finra.org/firm/firm_116797.pdf) Citadel has received have not prevented Ken Griffin's empire from monopolizing order flow as 27% of the trades for every listed security in US markets are executed by Citadel's Market Making division. Citadel, along with Point 72 - The hedge fund led by billionaire and convicted financial \*\*NON\*\*criminal Steve Cohen - absorbed Melvin Capital's short GME exposure after a $2.75 Billion investment saved Melvin from failure. The history of Citadel and Point 72 shows these firms are willing to bend, and out right break the rules, and it's concerning nothing has been said to ease the public's fears that these firms colluded with Robinhood to pull the greatest market manipulation of all time, especially given the very large financial motivation they had to do so.

&#x200B;

In addition to high short interest, there are many other aspects of GME that run parallel to OSTK, such as persistent failures to deliver (FTD's) making GME appear on the threshold security list. While FTD's of GME stock began declining after Q1, large and persistent fails returned in August. On 8/5/21, more than half the daily trading volume on GME failed to deliver, totaling 1,316,894 FTDs. The next day, FTD's dropped by 1 million to 315,331, yet total volume for 8/6/21 on GME was only 1,348,100, and 47% of that volume was reported short. I am unable to reconcile this. After 5 days of persistent fails, GME returned to the threshold security list on 8/10.

&#x200B;

Over the last 2 weeks, volatility has increased in the GME stock, and the $45 price increase on 8/24/21 required significant option related exposure rebalancing. While large price changes occurred in the GME option chains on 8/24/21 as thousands of strike prices became in the money, large delta and gamma exposure remained open and unhedged. After 8/24, volatility began to dampen, but delta and gamma exposure remained elevated relative to the neutral level based on the GME stock price. The days leading into the 8/27 option expiration would expect to have either increased buying volume of the GME stock, increased short covering of call options, increased long accumulation of call options, increased short selling of put options, increased long liquidation of put options, or some combination of these tactics. To help visualize the delta and gamma neutral levels of GME, please reference the chart below -

[Chart of GME and Corresponding Delta Neutral, Gamma Neutral, and Gamma Maximum Prices Represented Across all GME Option Chains - Credit to u\/yelyah2](https://preview.redd.it/89zxfwfa6zl71.png?width=910&format=png&auto=webp&s=41d4da2522e15aa57681257c839398ecae6d7828)

&#x200B;

**Key Concepts -**

* Delta Neutral (DN) - represents the underlying price that would create a total market delta of 0 across all options (all expiration dates). Delta represents the expected price change of an option contract relative to the underlying stock's price change.
* Gamma Neutral (GN) - represents the underlying price that would create a total market gamma of 0 across all options (all expiration dates). Gamma represents the expected change in the delta of an option relative to the underlying stock's price change.
* Gamma Maximum (GM) - represents the underlying price that would create the maximum gamma across all options (all expiration dates). A GM well above the underlying stock price indicates market makers have more bearish option exposure, and a quick rise above this point typically results is option exposure rebalancing to neutralize the bearish exposure and hedge against further upward price movements.
* Spikes in volatility are typically followed by periods of consolidation as shareholders and traders reposition exposure, both long and short. Afterwards, the price reverts back to a longer term average or continues to move in the same direction as the preceding volatility spike.
* Market makers use periods of consolidation to rebalance open delta and gamma exposure through buying or selling the underlying stock and options.
* Since market makers write both call and put options, a delta imbalance on an expiring chain indicates they need to deliver more shares of the underlying stock from writing ITM (in the money) calls than they are receiving from writing ITM puts. This is due to expiring option delta hitting 1 for all ITM options and 0 for all OTM (out of the money) options at expiration.
* Open option positions that are ITM at expiration are exercised. Each exercised option contract represents a 100 share delivery settled T+2 days after expiration.
* Stock prices can remain elevated relative to delta neutral levels in the option chains for extended periods of time as market makers may decide to carry elevated risks and hedge delta exposure as needed by purchasing only the required shares for delivery after options are exercised.

&#x200B;

The key concepts listed above are not all inclusive, and due to asymmetric information available to the public, it is impossible to know with absolute certainty where a market makers total exposure settles as other derivatives besides options can be used to offset exposure and hedge positions - such as total return swaps or ETF positions. However, these concepts do give an indication of things to expect in the near term, and the exposure rebalancing should ultimately leave evidence in the trading tape of the stock and options. This ties back to the rules and regulations in place requiring market makers to engage in bona-fide market making activity, and is highlighted by Welborn's [publication from Oct 9, 2007](https://www.deepcapture.com/wp-content/uploads/2007.10.09-J-Welborn-Married-Puts-and-Reverse-Conversions.pdf) referenced earlier, noting that:

>""*Bona-fide market making does not include activity that is related to speculative selling strategies or investment purposes of the broker-dealer and is disproportionate to the usual market making patterns or practices of the broker-dealer in that security. In addition, where a market maker posts continually at or near the best offer, but does not also post at or near the best bid, the market maker's activities would not generally qualify as bona-fide market making for purposes of the exception. Further, bona-fide market making does not include transactions whereby a market maker enters into an arrangement with another broker-dealer or customer in an attempt to use the market maker's exception for the purpose of avoiding compliance with Rule 203(b)(1) by the other broker-dealer or customer*.*20* *(Emphasis added.)""*

&#x200B;

While the asymmetric information described earlier could dampen these concerns if other derivatives offset the short exposure, there is growing concern the opposite is true, as other derivative(s) held by these firm(s) may also create short exposure to the GME stock. There is statistical evidence many ""meme"" stocks have likely been packaged and collateralized to create derivatives of portfolio swaps, or baskets of equity total return swaps. Year to date, correlated movements of certain securities across multiple unrelated industries have persisted without any fundamental reason. These correlations relative to GME price movements become stronger when taken as an average, rather than viewed as singular relationships, further supporting the thesis these securities have been bundled into opaque derivative products. It is nearly impossible this statistical anomaly is by chance or coincidence. The data is shown below -

[YTD Correlation Matrix of Stocks with Unrelated Businesses and Industries](https://preview.redd.it/h48lotmd6zl71.png?width=449&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c536300d0c48ac571eaaa30d187e247160d9401)

[GME daily VWAP changes has much stronger correlation \(83&#37;\) to an equal weighted basket of \\""meme\\"" stocks than any single stock correlation](https://preview.redd.it/u9gyvr4h6zl71.png?width=842&format=png&auto=webp&s=8109383b8e6e1d67aab9792de03a84362a3a2b73)

&#x200B;

With the concepts described above and bona-fide trading defined, reconciling the trading data after 8/25 unveils suspicious trading activity and dire concerns over how that trading activity creates systemically destabilizing risks. I will walk through this reconciliation process to provide evidence of market manipulation tied to married option trades similar to those described in the study of OSTK. ***My dire concerns are raised as evidence suggests instead of using ""married puts"" for manipulation that expose bad actors to downside risks capped by the put premium paid, ""married covered calls"" are being used to provide bad actors with the same ""bullets"" to drive down the GME stock price, while leaving bad actors exposed to asymmetric risks with unlimited downside due to naked short exposures in OTM calls.*** In the near term, these concerns are significantly elevated due to Gamestop's scheduled earnings release on 9/8. The GME earnings announcements in 2021 have been precursors to volatile stock movements, and on average the price has moved more than 30% after news becomes public. A sharp move higher in GME stock price can make naked short call positions quickly turn into 100-1 leveraged short exposure that has the potential to cause uncontainable losses beyond the short exposed firm(s) ability to cover, introducing systemic risks to all counterparties of the firm(s) with this short exposure.

&#x200B;

By reconciling the trade activity, on 8/27 the first glaring anomaly occurred, and began raising suspicions non-bona-fide trades were being executed to manipulate the GME stock price lower. In anticipation of the upcoming earnings release, volatility and exposure rebalancing is expected, especially after the $45 price increase on 8/24. However, market makers still have open delta and gamma exposure, and bona-fide trading would result in increased buying of GME stock and/or buying call options to close short positions or accumulate long positions. Traders and investors with long exposure may want to lighten long exposure by selling some GME stock or opening option based hedges through covered call writing or put buying. Short sellers have not materially changed the amount of shares borrowed, either due to lack of supply or unwillingness to increase short exposure, as shown in the graph below -

[Graph from https:\/\/iborrowdesk.com\/report\/GME - Far Left Green Axis\/Bars = GME Volume; Left Blue Axis\/Bars = GME Shares Available to Borrow; Dark Green Bars indicate overlapping volume\/available shares to borrow; Right Axis\/Black Line = GME Share Price; Net shares borrowed from 8\/26-9\/3 = 100k-15k = 85k borrowed shares](https://preview.redd.it/g8b6g3fk6zl71.png?width=1141&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a40f5910ea1c93f9464710dce0406c93ed7de19)

&#x200B;

Taking a detailed look at the 8/27/21 GME trades by volume and comparing those trades to the near dated option chain trades reveals a dynamic I have never witnessed. The option chains indicate no material changes were made with put options, however a significant portion of the days option trades were opening new short positions in call options. This would typically be viewed as covered call writing, and would indicate institutional investors have decided to hedge long exposure by writing covered calls instead of purchasing put options or reducing overall exposure by selling a portion of the underlying stock. This can be seen in the technical analysis of implied volatility (IV) and overall open interest changes as OI increases while IV decreases. A snapshot of the 8/27 option trades are below the descriptions of the four main technical indicator descriptions [provided HERE](https://marketchameleon.com/Overview/GME/OpenInterestTrends/) \-

* **Long Liquidation** happens when there is a decrease in open interest along with a decrease in implied volatility, indicating that traders are trying to sell out of their long positions in the option.
* **Long Buildup** is an increase in open interest along with an increase in implied volatility, indicating that traders are adding to long positions in the option.
* **Short Buildup** is an increase in open interest but a decrease in implied volatility, suggesting that traders are selling more contracts on short positions in the option.
* **Short Covering** is a decrease in open interest but an increase in implied volatility, suggesting that traders are buying back to cover short positions in the option.

&#x200B;

The following descriptions of the different types of trade volume I have analyzed are also needed to understand the next section and graph of 8/27/21 GME trading -

* **Intermarket Sweep Order (ISO)** is considered an aggressive marketable order that seeks immediate execution by sweeping the top of book of the lit exchanges. The ISO order can be an indication that a market participant is aggressively taking liquidity in a certain direction, and primarily used by institutional trades more concerned with filling an order quickly than filling an order at an optimal price over a longer time period.
* **Odd Lot Order** is an order for less than a round lot of 100 shares in GME. Increased retail trading interest in a stock typically shows increases in odd lot volume as retail investors do not always have the capital available to trade in full round lot sizes. Since Feb 2021, GME has also seen increased volumes of trades in dark pools- both ATS (Alternative Trade System) and non-ATS such as Citadel Connect, a single dealer platform (SDP). These trades outside of lit exchanges have averaged between 40-60 shares for the last 6 months, making the average dark pool trade an odd lot trade.
* **TRF Volume** is the volume reported to the consolidated tape, and should reflect all trading volume for the day. Odd lot volumes are included here, although odd lot trades do not impact the NBBO (National Best Bid and Offer). Dark pool volume is required to be reported to the TRF within 10 seconds of execution.

&#x200B;

While odd lot orders can signify retail trading, they have also increased market wide as daily volumes in dark pools have captured more share of overall market activity. This is a result of market makers and other institutions using odd lot orders to find out where prices within the NBBO and dark pools have buyers and sellers, without impacting the overall NBBO. Periods of increased odd lot trading and sweep trading on the same side of the bid or ask show this dynamic, as odd lots help determine price and market depth within the dark pool, followed by sweep trades that hit all remaining dark pool bids or asks as well as the bid or ask at NBBO and further down the order book. This combination of odd lot and sweep volume increases lead to the largest intraday swings of a stock price on any given day, and reflected in the final hours of 8/27/21 GME trade. The final hours of GME trading on 8/27/21 are also the most concerning and raise the most suspicion of potential manipulation. I am unable to reconcile how the trading volume was bona-fide -

* There were no material changes in borrowed shares, ruling out the possibility of new shorts.
* Market makers net delta and gamma exposure balances remained well below the GME stock price, ruling out bona-fide position rebalancing.
* Aggressive call writing/short accumulation in the near dated OTM option chains rules out institutional selling to reduce long exposure, as long exposure reduction would have either covered call writing or stock selling, not both.
* The overall net buying represented by total TRF trades indicates there were more buyers than sellers on the day, yet institutional selling seemed to outweigh institutional buying. The institutional selling pressure of the last few hours on 8/27/21 is very similar to selling pressure non bona-fide ""married puts"" caused in OSTK over a decade ago. There was not a bona-fide reason for the large increase in institutional selling in the final hours of 8/27/21.
* Adding to suspicions of non bona-fide trading is the VaR impact caused by option expiration. Buying a stock and writing covered calls against that purchase can give the appearance of a bona-fide trade, just as a ""married put"" trade can appear legitimate at first. However, a trade is not bona-fide if the intent of the purchased stock is to provide ""bullets"" to later sell large amounts of stock to drive the price down while keeping open short option exposure. As the 8/27 options expired, any OTM short call exposure on the 8/27 chain disappears. The risk exposure of the 8/27 OTM short call position will not be included in future counterparty VaR or credit limits due to the expiration. This dynamic effectively conceals true counterparty risk exposure caused by the open short positions in OTM calls throughout the final hours of the day.

&#x200B;

The same option trading patterns from 8/27 were present throughout last week from 8/30-9/3. This adds further concerns over increased moral hazard risks as a positive outcome from using systemically destabilizing risk exposure creates behavioral changes and increased confidence the trade will work again in the future. See images below -

&#x200B;

On 9/3/21, all the dynamics surrounding what would make a bona-fide institutional trade remained the same as 8/27/21. However, the magnitude of the institutional selling pressure increased, leaving the net balance of institutional trade much greater on the sell side than the buy side, while overall TRF trading ended with slightly more selling than buying (\~30k shares net sold). Please see chart below -

&#x200B;

While two weeks of analysis does not yet provide enough data to validate a new trend, the data supports the concerns of moral hazard risk growing week over week, as the success of this tactic on 8/27 seemed to increase the commitment of the bad actors on 9/3. If the recent success of this manipulative strategy has in fact emboldened bad actors to try it again with even more capital dedicated to the scheme, things could unravel quickly if GME earnings release on 9/8 causes the price to rise the same percentage as the moves following the previous earnings releases this year. The tactic of using ""married covered calls"" instead of ""married puts"" seems to be a new dynamic and likely not properly accounted for in counterparty VaR and credit modeling because the outsized asymmetric risks associated with holding naked unhedged short call exposure is likely unfathomable to most financial professionals that a counterparty would take such high risk, low profit bets. In addition, option exposure VaR modeling I am familiar with has not historically been robust enough to capture day of expiration naked short call exposure, leaving room for bad actors to exploit asymmetric information on their positions relative to counterparty expectations.

&#x200B;

I urge those whom find this open letter concerning or invalid to participate in the discussion by leaving comments. I welcome all data supported criticism. I will be filing a formal complaint to the SEC regarding the information within this letter, and I hope it finds the eyes of the regulators before it is too late. While I agree with Gary Gensler's recent focus on protecting retail investors from gamification, such as confetti being shown after trading on certain apps, I fear this attention is using the limited man hours and resources regulators have while larger issues remain unaddressed. Namely, the systemic risks described above, the concerns regarding monopolization of order flows, and the rise of dark pool trading and potential abuses. In my humble opinion, these issues should be taking precedence. Citadel is the designated market maker for GME, so while there is a chance they have not engaged in wrongdoings, it is highly unlikely the trading activity from bad actors did not flow through Citadel's market making arm. The short GME exposure Citadel, along with Point 72, gained from the Melvin Capital investment in January, combined with these firm's history of wrong doings and outright financial crimes in the case of Steve Cohen led firms, adds plausible reasons to suspect they are involved in the current malicious and manipulative trading patterns in GME. Additionally, there is clear financial motivation for these particular firms to engage in collusion to manipulate the share price of GME lower.

Hello my simian brethren,

Last time I wrote of the state of the dip was January 10, 2022 when we enjoyed what we thought at the time was a dismal price of $131. How we long to see such a price once again from the depths of $100! In my last address, I showed that internalization in dark pools was acting strangely (and have suffered through weeks of internalizing DIX jokes). I also showed that the put/call ratio was higher, indicating that someone was using a higher than normal number of puts to drive the price down via delta hedging. My thesis at the time was that our price drop was due to buying puts and internalizing buys, not due to apes paper handing.

I’m here today to reaffirm that the state of the dip remains strong as of February 7, 2022. I will lay out an even deeper dive into the options chain and short sales to support the thesis that apes, indeed, continue to hold.

# Part 1: The Options Chain

There are mixed feelings and half-baked theories about options on this sub. I personally am pro-options and think the data I am about to present will strongly support that position. However, the goal of this post is not to recommend an investing strategy, but simply to explain why the price has swung between $100-250 over the last year.

First, let's reintroduce the concept of delta hedging. If a market maker sells a call to someone, the buyer of that contract can exercise or “call away” 100 shares from the market maker.

>The probability that someone holding that contract will call those shares away is called delta, and is always a decimal number between 0-1. This number represents  a fraction of the contract’s 100 shares that should be hedged by the Market Maker (0 being 0/100 shares and 1 being 100/100 shares). This concept is known as Delta Hedging, and it can also be thought of as a measure of how likely the Buyer exercises the contract, with “0” meaning the owner won’t exercise and “1” meaning  the owner will.

The market maker just wants to make money selling contracts - they don’t want to bet on the value of the stock, so they must prepare for the chance that the option will be exercised by buying other contracts to hedge.

As the price of the underlying stock moves up or down, the delta value changes as well, and the market maker is able to sell off (less delta) or buy more (higher delta) to hedge and stay “Delta Neutral”..

>For example: if I buy a call option with a delta of 0.5, the market maker should buy 50 shares. As the price of the stock rises, they buy more shares; as it falls, they sell shares.  
>  
>The opposite is true for puts, whose delta values are negative and are between -1 and 0. If a market maker sells a put, then they will have to sell shares onto the market to stay delta neutral.

Due to this mechanic of Delta Hedging, the process of buying and selling options drives buying and selling on the underlying.

**Question 1: How much of our daily volume is just due to delta hedging options?**

This is actually something that we can investigate with the data available from the options chain. What I propose below is an estimate of the amount of daily volume attributed to delta hedging. You could get a more exact estimate using the Black-Scholes equation but I think that is overkill for what we are trying to do.

To estimate the number of shares hedged each day I do the following:

&#x200B;

* Calculate the price movement, also known as: difference between the daily high and low price.
* Multiply this difference by the gamma and the number of open contracts (open interest) for each call and put on the option chain.
* Sum the values for both calls and puts

Okay so I just explained delta, what the heck is gamma? Gamma tells you how much delta (the fraction of shares that should be hedged) will change as the price of the stock changes. So I calculate the daily change in price, calculate the change in delta, and multiply by the open interest and sum.

This estimate makes a few assumptions:

* It assumes that daily changes in price are small, so gamma values don’t change much.
* It assumes that only the existing contracts are perfectly delta hedged, and ignores the buying and selling of new contracts that day.
* It assumes that the stock only hits the high price and the low price one time that day and  doesn’t bounce around.

All of these assumptions are fairly conservative, and I suspect the actual hedging to be larger. I then take all of the daily hedging volume and I divide it by the daily volume of the stock. The results are below.

[Daily Volume Due to Options Hedging as a &#37; of Daily Total Volume](https://preview.redd.it/w88vv0y15pg81.png?width=1136&format=png&auto=webp&s=51ca28d9e7425102e20f17a50807a5d5fe8fd388)

**In this graph, 100% indicates that all of the daily trading volume on GME is due to options hedging!**

As you can see, there are clear variations between January 1st and July 1st 2021, where options hedging  made up only a small percent of daily volume.  Options hedging was significant during the February and May runs, but was very low otherwise. To contrast, after July 1st 2021, the delta hedging is between 50-100%. Since this estimate is fairly conservative, I can say with some confidence that nearly all of the volume we have seen on the stock since July is due to delta hedging the options chain.

This would mean that the natural buying and selling of GME is minimal, aka apes largely bought in during the first half of 2021 and **DIAMOND HANDED THAT SHIT TILL NOW**. All of the price action we have been seeing on the stock is due entirely to the delta hedging of options, and not significantly affected by retail buying and selling the stock. This is supported by data from multiple brokerages (Fidelity buy/sell ratio, Ally percent diamond handers data, etc.) all showing that APES are not selling.

**Question 2: Can we relate the overall delta pressure of the options chain to the price movement of the stock?**

I have attempted to answer this question by calculating the relative strength of call and put delta over time - effectively how much of an effect Calls and Puts have on the stock and how much they can push the price higher or lower, respectively. This is calculated by subtracting put delta from call delta, and dividing by the total delta on the options chain. This works similarly to calculating the individual delta of an option, with the number falling on a scale from -1 to 1. If the options chain was 100% calls, the value would be 1. If it was 100% puts, then it would be -1. 0 indicates that they are equal. The plot below shows the relative delta strength in blue against the price in orange.

[Relative Delta Strength Overlaid \(blue\) with Price \(orange\)](https://preview.redd.it/3nriihmp4pg81.png?width=1209&format=png&auto=webp&s=e22048b9d50205599c26dbee08ebf71dc6f2fb5d)

You can see that after July 1st, 2021, the price and the relative delta strength line up quite well, suggesting that our price is determined largely by delta hedging options. So let’s then graph this relative delta strength vs. the price of the underlying:

[Delta Strength vs. Price: Correlation](https://preview.redd.it/wnb3ogwy4pg81.png?width=1091&format=png&auto=webp&s=c66d15aecd192d0cf0fc9ff27313d951d5c40c11)

**Holy fucking shit, goshdang, and gee willickers!**

I’ve been trying to find good correlations amongst the data for GME for a YEAR and I have never found one this strong. This data shows that the price of the Stock correlates very strongly  to the relative delta strength with an R-squared value between 0.8-0.9. Now of course correlation does not equal causation, which is why I laid out the mechanics of this proposed causative relationship above. However, I believe this is proof that:

1. the price of GME is determined by the options chain
2. buying calls moves the price up
3. buying puts moves the price down

You may notice some of the data does not fall neatly within the dotted lines above. Those data points all represent dates from January 6th 2022 until today, and they warrant more discussion. Let’s zoom in on our relative delta strength graph from before…

[Closeup of Jan 6th spike in Relative Delta Strength](https://preview.redd.it/ke1t1tqo6pg81.png?width=1289&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec350530cac6362973feb2efa74ce56ba34cc907)

There was a violent jump on January 6th from a delta of 0, to a delta of \~0.5 in one day. Interestingly, that evening is when the price ran more than 50$ in after hours under the guise of the NFT marketplace leak. Rather, I believe that this was in fact due to Market makers delta hedging this “shock” to the options chain. The next day, this jump was then heavily shorted back down to a price around $140. Going back to relative delta strength vs. price, an interesting observation emerges:

[🤔](https://preview.redd.it/6flzcax17pg81.png?width=1292&format=png&auto=webp&s=547e13c6938e56e682447aa7c4d4452b95eca768)

If the options were properly delta hedged, the price of the stock should have been between $165-220 on January 6th, and indeed the peak in after hours was $176 which is in line with expectations. However, the following day we begin to deviate from the previous trend. This deviation continues throughout the month of January and into February. What this deviation shows is that call delta no longer moves the price as high as it used to. This dilution of delta hedging power comes from increased liquidity of the stock.  Where did this liquidity come from?  Either apes sold (narrator: they didn’t) or someone heavily shorted.

**Did someone say shorts?**

The chart below shows that the interest rate began to increase for GME share lending started…on the goddamn 6th of January. So, this reduction in the ability of call delta to move the price is likely due to dilution of the stock from increasing shorts.

[ORTEX short borrow rate](https://preview.redd.it/v27g40ad7pg81.png?width=1601&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0d65edce043acec133df4b0fa548e5b890f60da)

[ORTEX short utilization, that second spike begins on January 6th](https://preview.redd.it/ziljq5lh7pg81.png?width=2088&format=png&auto=webp&s=7dfc566041b5f5412f71fc7ac018b7dda9f396c6)

So lets recap:

* Since July 1st 2021, all or nearly all of the trading volume of GME is likely due to Market makers buying and selling the stock to delta hedge the options chain.
* The impact of this option chain hedging results in a predictable change in price, indicating that much of the dip we are currently experiencing is due to shorts buying in the money puts to force the price downward with the synthetics created from market maker hedging.
* Starting in January 2022, we begin to noticeably deviate from previous behavior, and this deviation is strongly correlated to the increase in GME borrowing that’s been observed by others.
* APES AREN’T SELLING (BUT YOU ALREADY KNEW THAT, DIDN’T YOU?).

**Question 3: Who gives a shit? What now?**

Well beyond jacking your tits with confirmation bias, I think this provides compelling evidence for a particular path forward (which luckily is already a path embraced by many apes). It’s clear from this data that the price is both **FAKE** and  **WRONG**. If we also consider that XRT is  now on the RegSHO threshold list, it shows that they are  bringing out all of the big guns they have access to, and they are still unable to get the price to stay under $100 for more than a partial trading day. Making this informed assumption, they are likely pretty close to all in at this point.

So how does the game stop? I believe the stock price must rise to put enough pressure on both their short position and  on their margin, which they are fighting incredibly hard to protect. The best way to do this is to BOTH buy and hodl, AND buy far-dated, near the money calls with high delta. Holding the stock preserves the floor, and buying call options increases the price. Without an increase in price, this gives them time to drag out their position and slowly cover over time. To be clear, I am not interested in arguing about the merits of options for each individual investor. Only you and no one else can decide if options belong in your portfolio. I am simply trying to provide data and understanding for the situation, and if nothing else, reinforce the fact that ...

**NO ONE IS SELLING.**

**DO NOT FEEL PRESSURED TO BUY OPTIONS IF YOU CANNOT AFFORD or UNDERSTAND THEM**

**JUST CONTINUE TO DIAMOND HAND THOSE SHARES AND LET APES WITH THE UNDERSTANDING AND CAPITAL BUY OPTIONS**

GME needs apes to continue to hold the defensive while others are able to take the fight to the hedgies.

**TL;DR:**

Ook Ook, bitches. Moon soon.

I would like to thank u/gherkinit and all of the folks involved in his quant team for helping me gather and process data, as well as help develop and test hypotheses. They did some heavy lifting on this one, particularly in gathering full daily options chain data for GME from Jan 4th, 2021 until today.

A reminder of the hypothesis: the price of the stock has been solely driven by delta hedging options, shorting ETFs containing GME (maybe related? See DD by u/Turdferg23 and u/bobsmith808), and shorting GME itself.

Wycking off for OPEX: Confluence of Datasets and what drives GME's Quarterly Runs,"Hello Everybody,

As many of you know we have been doing a lot of research into the FTDs, ETF shares creation, and swaps that support these quarterly moves.

After the failure of price action to be realized through. Most of December and January, I will cover what went wrong and what went right later in this DD. Move forward and apply the failures in expectations to future outlooks.

There is a lot of hype built around this week, with expectations high I wanted to ensure to the best of my ability that not only did market mechanics point to an improvement in price this coming week but that volume, trend, stochastic and price analysis indicated it as well.

In an effort to be as absolutely certain as the data available would allow.

# What is OPEX?

OPEX is a bit of a misnomer, it is technically the Options Expiration (OPEX) of ETF and Index options. These actually occur every month but the quarterly options dates are the ones that effect GameStop primarily as the majority of institutional options interest in ETF and Indices is quarterly.

These occur per the [CBOE Calendar](https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/options/Cboe2021OPTIONSCalendar.pdf) on the 3rd Friday of every month.

We however are only concerned with the quarterly expirations, which occur in

Feb/May/Aug/Nov

So why do these events which have very little to do with GME have such a great effect?

Well due to share creation in ETFs and lack of interest in borrowing real shares of GME in order to deflate the overnight borrow rate. The vast majority of shares sold are synthetically created by Authorized participants.

As creation/redemption builds in GME containing ETFs large numbers of puts are sold to mark long (Reg T) the net short allocation due from the AP.

It is then likely swaps are used by the fund themselves to offset the debit from creation.

So if XRT is -250,000 shares of GME and they have forwards or an (agreement to buy those shares at a future time based on the current ""spot"" price (market) ) Then their position is considered neutral.

Let me show you visually.

*\*  Edit 1:*

*Since a lot of the people in the comments are asking me to clarify why this documentlowers my confidence in DRS.  Also, because I see a lot of misinformation surrounding it and want to be 100% clear to avoid confusion.*

* *The share creation process in ETFs and the ability of Authorized Participants to do this essentially as long as GME is held in ETFs* ***without facilitating a locate of real shares***\*. It is unlikely that anything short of 100% share registration could force a squeeze or stop shorting on GME. As long GME volume remains low it is likely this abusive system will continue to be used. The benefit being that we have large unstable price increases every quarter.\*
* *As long as shares are held in ETFs by institutions even with 100% registration this system could continue.* ***To be transparent on this point most ETFs do not allow this abuse, it really seems that XRT and a few smaller ETFs are the primary source of corruption.***
* *It tells me that multiple institutions including the SEC and DTCC are aware of the problem and likely already aware that the float of GME is fully owned, and have yet to take any action.* ***It presents systemic risk***\*...meaning if the process were to be stopped or accounted for it could very well bring down the structure of the entire market.\*
* *Some people in the comments addressed T+5 (it's actually not 6, but since settlement is delayed till the following morning T+6 is used for ease of understanding). I show clearly above how they sell short puts on the ETF to mark long the FTDs which adds 35 calendars to the settlement time (Reg T) then cash settle the FTDs with the ETF. Effectively never returning the synthetic position at least not in the form of stock. The obligations then go on to cycle through CNS until such a time as they are cleared. ETFs have an effectively unlimited free-float, are highly liquid, and thus it is easy to clear FTDs in them.*
* *GME ownership has no effect on ETF FTDs or ETF settlement, while this process effects the ""fair valuation"" of GME there is no way to effect and obligation due to a different asset. This process is criminal, as it defrauds the investors of the ETF and also the investors of the underlying assets.*
* *Essentially ETFs create unlimited liquidity*
* ***I do however agree with Dr. Trimbath, that DRS empowers the individual shareholder and can protect the stock from the effects of abusive short-selling.*** *Unfortunately this process is abusive selling and not short-selling. The difference being short-selling requires a borrow.*
* *I think that Ryan Cohen is already doing the one foolproof thing to stop abusive short-selling and that is building a company that isn't worth shorting ""brick by brick"" and I'm excited to see what it becomes.*
* *In the meantime this winding and unwinding of these ETF positions will continue every quarter until there is evidence that they are no longer doing it via reported FTDs and ETF fund flow.*

So after all that when those forwards are closed and the put oi drops the forward contract counterparty goes and buys some GameStop.

This occurs within T+2 of these OPEX dates along with any gamma exposure from options exercising.

The more creation used in the previous quarter ---> the more GameStop gets purchased.

***\*remember creation is not a short sale, it is a share sold, it is synthetic. A short sale requires a borrow, no share borrow agreement is used in these transactions.***

# Wycoff Accumulation

Some information on this can be found here [Richard D. Wyckoff](https://www.wyckoffanalytics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Wyckoff-Method-Wyckoff-Analytics-English.pdf), this price analysis methodology has held up for almost a century due to the market psychology that supports it. It is an invaluable tool for tracking the intentions of large or ""smart"" money investors.

*\*I should note here It is* ***not*** *traditional Technical Analysis while it fathered many of the trend and volume analysis styles that followed it.*

Currently GameStop is displaying classic signs of accumulation. This is significant both in the near and long term as valuation on GME is reassessed by large market participants.

[It looks we are rising on a textbook Wyckoff spring formation it's indicating a spring into a breakout. usually followed by a markup period moving from phase C to phase D](https://preview.redd.it/8kvvfscj54j81.png?width=2457&format=png&auto=webp&s=05ee8ee95b1365c5659c8baf16f7192ac9c4ac4a)

It should be noted there is a bear case for this as well while less fun to hear it's best to temper expectations. It is possible enough interest has not accumulated on GME during this period and there are more low tests in store. I didn't want to ignore this especially with uncertainty in the global political landscape.

**I however do not have high confidence in the bear case here, I will now explain why.**

>**A lot of the same pieces are in place. High FTD exposure from ETFs, what looks like institutional buying, and the incoming OPEX cycle. GME's bull case looks very strong. For the near and long-term, as this looks like move into a period of improvement.**

# MACD

I wanted to look at MACD in another way besides the sweeping up and down volume signals. As liquidity dries up I feel that they are less telling than the signal trend so I shaded this so people could see the double divergence in GME's downtrends. This divergence is then mirrored in the uptrends indicating that two primary mechanisms are used to short and then those two mechanisms are covered.

*\*These being ETF share creation and bona-fide market making.*

[I highlighted the signal trend here in an effort to look beyond the volume indicators and focus on the repeating pattern In the daily MACD. That second low peak has marked the beginning of every one of GameStop's previous runs.](https://preview.redd.it/76fg4w62z4j81.png?width=2225&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cb15e7a8940e3079e5ad3c68aba12117ee7d877)

# NVI

Negative volume index, I wanted to give people an idea of just how much shorting we have experienced over the last couple months since Nov 3rd (the last time we were above the mean EMA).

Also take a look at volume trend since last march as a little extra confirmation of of illiquidity . Our deviation is the lowest it has been since last December. They can't keep this shit up forever.  :)

[This is literally the best time to buy GME since December of 2020](https://preview.redd.it/o37i40u425j81.png?width=2459&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7919ce96f1d183d5d45fec7828bbb6ece2bd629)

# Price Predictions

So with this Information and the last update I had from yelyah2 showing a gamma maximum of around 140 and some indication of it increasing due to large volumes of OTM calls. I would say a conservative range for this OPEX movement would be between 150 and 180. I have based this prediction on the following factors.

1. Gamma Maximum tends to follow price upwards as more OTM calls are purchased (FOMO) it can drive up but when call buying dwindles there is no more delta to hedge. The rate of change in the underlying slows and price destabilizes. We have yet to hold above our Gamma MAX on any previous run. (see below)
2. Our previous OPEX runs have been fairly range bound with the exception of last February. While I must admit the exposure they have built in the last two months is far greater than anything since last Feb. The strength of OPEX runs had decreased over the remainder of last year. Due to a decrease in long call sentiment and thus weakened ETF exposure. T**here is mathematical evidence that the primary driver of  GME price action are options both up and down** [Evidence of Concept](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/snzn04/it_takes_money_to_buy_whisky_distilling_gmes/) and that Delta hedging makes up most if not all of our volume. Till it can be debunked, I am convinced that they do **in fact hedge options**.
3. Our volume trends do not support  a move much greater than 180 the strongest buy pressure on GME historically is at 158.50 and 180.00 going back to January of last year. Any price points above that have been met with decreasing buy volume (due to surpassing gamma max) and the price becoming too high to continue FOMO. Simply put Quarterly OPEX alone is not enough to sustain continued price improvement past a certain range. This is one of the reasons our run in November was so weak, since the floor was so high when the run started it was only supported by the clearing of obligations and delta hedging. As soon as the obligations cleared... rug pull.

[Gamma MAX on previous runs \(figure 1\)](https://preview.redd.it/v1x7cpwj95j81.png?width=1323&format=png&auto=webp&s=64ebf5495996917e7f7d2bab2932308c0b82fb1c)

[Price improvement confidence scale for Feb. 18 -25 OPEX. While this indicates a fairly low range it is possible for FOMO to come in and drive the price even higher but since that is not something that can be predicted or counted on this scenario has the best probability in my mind.](https://preview.redd.it/rnwkmh7je5j81.png?width=2447&format=png&auto=webp&s=3afc6720c24601f8696b73720011dd70a4ba3e51)

# Past Prediction Failures

While I feel many of my predictions have been spot on and they only will increase in accuracy as I narrow down the mechanics of GME price realization. There have been plenty of things I have gotten wrong or did not realize were a factor and thus had not explored.

First let me toot my horn before I focus on the negative.

Some stuff that I 've gotten right...

1. The August run and it's price range.
2. The November run and it's price range (but the volume and velocity were wrong)
3. The runs this last quarter on Dec 17th - 22nd, Jan. 26th, and Feb. 8th (price expectations were not realized)

All of these, months in advance , the biggest disappointments came in the realization of price action. stonks only go up right?

No, the market is dynamic. Things change everyday and no prediction is immune to shifts in macro-economic trends. This is why I update on the status of my theory every day to preempt these shifts and changes, as necessary, in real-time.

[As for the expected run I wrote about these OPEX cycles in August and November of last year.](https://preview.redd.it/1wop6zgib8j81.png?width=2454&format=png&auto=webp&s=e97bb068647336150f4b4bb1f98b660b32b33e17)

**So why did December and January fail to drive expected results? or why do you suck Pickle-man?**

In short **XRT**, and some other ETFs that were placed on the threshold list on the futures expiration date.

This action was **beneficial** to the the people generating GME FTDs and I would suspect it was done intentionally, although there is no proof the motive is obvious.

RegSho Threshold while forcing settlement offsets when that settlement is due. So instead of all the ETF FTDs being due the same day it staggers them. This allows them to clear FTDs through CNS without overloading the ""pipeline""(generating price action). Essentially taking GME exposure and diluting it across multiple assets.

https://preview.redd.it/upitmvpce8j81.png?width=1306&format=png&auto=webp&s=3de4acaf63ac0f0b7a3f999870b0baee82660dac

The effects of this offsetting can be seen in our volume profile from Nov -Jan when for all intents and purposes our daily volume should remain very low (DRS and less liquidity **≠** more volume) but to settle FTDs volume must be generated. Yet our volume over the last cycle is up...

[This should not be the case](https://preview.redd.it/jgqcfc1if8j81.png?width=2454&format=png&auto=webp&s=af47603890ac27b2f27d16786a167d198f43be47)

They actually began using XRT in late October. Finally burning it out on Jan 6th when the threshold process began.

Or so we thought.

While a threshold security cannot be shorted without a pre-borrow agreement. ETFs have no float so pre-borrowing is easy and creation/redemption can continue on the ETF regardless of it's RegSHO status. It does make it more difficult though and means more oversight of their actions.

Essentially they shorted the entirety of the Nov-Jan cycle through ETF share creation and bona-fide market making.

It was only after the RegSHO inclusion that we see GME share borrow utilization go up. You can see some evidence of this above in the negative volume index in the first section. Also here in GME short utilization after thresholding began on Jan.7th.

[GME short borrow rate, utilization, and exchange reported SI shooting up after XRT begins the threshold process.](https://preview.redd.it/ra8igl4mq8j81.png?width=1606&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2337a2af85c1c12150232e3a9657bf1994675ee)

There is additional evidence in entropy analysis on GME and it's related ETFs, but that's another DD.

# Conclusions:

All this synthetic creation will come due and someone will be on the hook for it whether it be the ETFs, APs, or counterparties on the swap, settlement will be demanded from at-risk counterparties.

I'm bullish as fuck on the potential for these next few weeks to create massive price improvement on GME, but one step at a time. I have laid out my conservative estimate for this OPEX cycle and we will wait and see what the futures rollover period brings after that.

&#x200B;

**Now on to the part that I feel I need to discuss, in an attempt to heal the divide in this community and to defend my position here.**

# Am I a shill?

Well you're gonna hear a lot of things about me

1. **That I buy puts** : I do occasionally to protect my investment when I expect GME to go down. It's accurate, I buy OTM puts to protect my long position if I think the price of the stock is gonna drop. It's not a bet against the company it's a bet against the person who wrote the contract I purchased. If the price goes down I have more money to buy the dip. Simple as that.
2. **That I'm self-promoting and monetized**: I have been pretty transparent with my YT earnings on stream they are minimal. Some people do choose to donate it's true. But, there has never been a paywall to ask me questions or access my content. I see no reason YT should collect all the ad-revenue. If I do this for 8 hours a day there is no reason for me to not collect the ad-revenue from my work, I do not ask for donations and never have if people want to contribute I have left the option open. **If I wanted to advertise on reddit** I could pay for Reddit's advertising service and advertise my stream through reddit, on the subreddits of my choosing for a nominal fee per click, I do not.
3. **The idea I'm pushing options to sell my own covered calls**: This one is just makes no sense... the OCC creates liquidity for options trades. Guaranteeing a buyer and seller for every trade. This liquidity is provided by MMs that market the markets for each asset (Wolverine for GME). So I do not need to generate buyers of my covered calls as a matter of fact I haven't sold a covered call (for more than a couple hours) since March of 2021.
4. **I said ""most"" Superstonk users were idiots**: True, I said these five words, there is a 4 second video proving it, out of context, but accurate nonetheless. It was in response to someone describing the people that consistently bandwagon and attack me and my posts everyday in order to spin a narrative that I am profiteering on the back of apes. **I could have risen above it, I did not.**

**I have stood now for months in the face of personal attacks on my character, credibility, intelligence, and appearance. Because I chose to discuss the value of options contracts to the retail investor and their ability to generate a short squeeze scenario. The fact that I need to defend myself against these baseless claims speaks volumes about what this sub has become.**

**If their hope is that I will back down, I will not.**

**This behavior goes against the very essence of this subreddit and should be addressed.**

[It's literally Rule #1](https://preview.redd.it/sv5ymxims8j81.png?width=587&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f2a004580424d2c7408d6584ad085d115fb91dd)

But I have not lost faith,

I think the **vast silent majority** appreciate the knowledge and information and whether they agree or not, walk away more informed about the stock we all love.

**We can disagree, we can refute claims with evidence or proof to the contrary. We can discuss but we should never attack. The claims levied against me and other DD writers have been just that, attacks.**

**When we fight amongst ourselves nobody walks away a winner.**

I personally have, posted copious amounts of DD and Daily updates **every** trading for the last 10, almost 11 months now. I have given my perspective on GME and it's price movements. I have reached out in good faith and collaborated with others that were attempting to do the same. I have published all this information here on reddit, I have never withheld information behind a paywall or forced people to watch my stream.

Everything you can learn from me about GME **can be found here, for free**.

I have made predictions, have they always been right, **absolutely not**. The stock market is a chaotic system a prediction on an outcome can change the nature of that outcome.

But every wrong estimate moves us closer to the ones that are correct and lifts the curtain on the actions of SHFs. Price predictions are always a toss up but the underlying mechanics that drive GME price movement are testable and backed by data.

>Columbia University emeritus professor of philosophy Philip Kitcher, a good scientific theory has three characteristics. First, it has unity, which means it consists of a limited number of problem-solving strategies that can be applied to a wide range of scientific circumstances. Second, a good scientific theory leads to new questions and new areas of research. This means that a theory doesn't need to explain everything in order to be useful. And finally, a good theory is formed from a number of hypotheses that can be tested independently from the theory itself.

&#x200B;

I write this in defense of myself and others who do not wish to step forward, or cannot.

To attack the people who have dedicated countless hours of their lives to bring information to the community is completely despicable, whether you agree with the information, or not. Many of these people have sacrificed countless hours of their lives. Losing time with family and loved ones. To bring things to light that never would have been know to have a contingent of people allowed on this sub to openly insult, intimidate, and harass them.

I don't think I need to name them, they are made obvious by their comments and posts.

Those seeking to divide us are not apes.

I also wanted to share my own clip, and maybe this will give a better idea of my views on this whole situation and motivations.

My idiot racist neighbors and the petty revenge before we moved.,"Someone in another sub suggested I post here. Hopefully my story belongs here? On mobile so sorry for formatting. 

We once had neighbors that from the day we moved in, absolutely *hated* us. We never even met them but they made our lives hell in every way they could.

We had moved to that area, putting my grad school and our big life plans on hold to look after my MIL who had stage 4 cancer so it was already a crappy reason to move and we hated the area (rural California is very ye-haw in a bad way, if you know what I mean).

The neighbors were garbage people and just awful to us. They never did anything illegal per say, but every petty thing you can think of to make our lives shitty, they did.

For example, our water hose was on their lawn after I watered my roses by about two inches. It was coiled mostly on our side but I wasn’t done watering and just stepped into the house for a few minutes for a lunch break. While I was inside, they CUT the two inches off it that was on their property and threw it in our yard but left the rest of the hose that was on our side. Absurdly petty. They had never even met us or spoken to us!

Finally, after about two years of this, I was talking with my across the street neighbor about it and she told me they were treating us that way because they thought we were “illegals.” I’m Native American and my spouse is Hispanic but they thought we were both Mexican. I asked he why they thought we were from Mexico and she said before we moved in, some of our forwarded mail accidentally ended up in their box and it had “your Mexican address on it.”

NEW MEXICO, we are from *New* Mexico. These idiot racist thought we bought a home in an upscale neighborhood in coastal California with cash and we came straight from Mexico to do it so we must be part of a cartel and here illegally.

They had concocted this whole Narcos scenario because my husband’s last name is Lovato (it’s not but a similar old hispanic last name widely used), we are darker than they deemed appropriate, we bought our house with cash (we had sold our starter house we put *years* of backbreaking work into renovating and made a killing on it), and they didn’t know New Mexico is a fucking US state.

It was all so absurd! Don’t worry, the story has a happy ending: when we moved out after my MIL passed, I wrote them a long letter telling them how embarrassingly stupid they are (I’m Native so I was sure to tell them they were the ones trespassing on *my* land, gained *illegally* by their government) and how they were giant assholes for making what was already a hard time on my husband who was dealing with the slow death of his mother (a highly respected physician in the area so yeah, not an illegal cartel member) an even worse time so I hope they’re proud of themselves.

Then we stole their cat.

About the cat: They neglected him and left him outside covered in fleas and fending for himself day and night, in the terrible heat of summer without water and in the freezing cold of winter without shelter. The cat had already moved in with us because we actually cared for it and we took care of his medical needs. In my book, you treat your cat like crap and you didn’t microchip him? He’s mine.

So! One good thing came from our time there and he’s napping in the windowsill right now. We named him Flavio after Flavio Méndez Santiago, the famous Mexican Cartel drug lord.

Fuck racists.

TL;DR: We had idiot racist nightmare neighbors so we “stole” their cat.

Edit: So sorry I forgot to pay cat tax! I hope this works, I’m not good at linking images: [Flavio aka Flavs](https://imgur.com/a/v2EMt4O)

Edit 2 to clear some confusion up: 

1. I don’t think they *honestly* thought we were Mexican cartel because that’s just too stupid but maybe I’m giving them more credit than I should. What they told my neighbor was something like “you know, I *bet* they’re part of a cartel or something! We looked up their house on public records and do you know they paid cash for it? And with their last name and being from south of the boarder and all. *Definitely* illegals.” She said they went on to say how “sketchy” we looked (we look like normal Gen X-ers, not really sure what she meant by that but I can guess).

2. I know it’s “per se.” Autocorrect screwed me and I didn’t catch it in the reread before I posted. I just left it because it’s not a big deal, you know what I meant. Please stop trying to correct me. Autocorrect gets us all at some point. 

3. More about the kitty: for a long time we thought he was stray. We asked our other neighbors (everyone else around us was pretty welcoming and very nice) if anyone knew whose cat it was. They all said they didn’t know but two people we talked to thought he was left by the previous owners of our home. After a little while of watching him seem to be neglected, hoping someone would take care of him, we started helping him in little ways like giving him flea drops, leaving water out for him, and letting him in our garage when the weather was terrible. A little later on, we got him a heated bed in there for winter and started making him come inside every night (he used to get in terrible fights at night and was always banged up). He was very thin so eventually we started feeding him as well. 

Then he got in a terrible scrap and had a nasty gash along his back. It was swollen and very painful looking so we took him to the vet to get treated. We had him scanned for a chip and when one didn’t come up, we figured he was now ours. 

We moved him inside the house while he was on antibiotics and recovered. Still fearing he was just very lost and maybe had a home somewhere, we checked all the lost pet bulletins in our area and put found pet ones up of our own. A month later and still nothing so we had him chipped to us. 

It wasn’t until a few years later, right before we moved away, we were talking with our same neighbor and she said, “you know, the Smiths (not their real name) told me you stole their cat. I told them no one knew he was their cat and if they wanted him back, all they had to do was ask you guys at any time and that you’re very nice people.” She said they just snickered at the prospect and walked away. 

So fuck ‘em, he’s our cat now. (And our new neighbor’s who love him dearly and treat him like the king he is.) They treated him like shit, they treated us like shit, we took their cat and never looked back.

Edit 3 Because this wasn't long enough.

Some people keep saying I should have just talked directly with my neighbors. Others are focused on them cutting my hose and saying that is property damage and I should have reported them. And then there’s the “fake story!” comments.

I’ll address the first two topics but I honestly don’t care if some people think my story isn’t true. I envy the sheltered and privileged lives they live where systemic racism and illogical leaps based on that racism is so out there of a concept, it must be fake (like Birthers aren’t a thing and people don’t get fatally shot for just turning around in someone’s driveway).

People keep focusing on the hose they cut (which is just the tip of the iceberg of petty shitty things they did to us, there’s another great example to follow) saying we should have called the cops for property damage. We were supporting a dying parent, watching as she deteriorated painfully every day. The last thing we had spoons for was escalating a petty war with sneaky nincompoop racists that had nothing better to do than make our lives even shittier.

After I found out why they didn’t like us, I wrote them a long letter as a peace offering in hopes the shitty behavior could be stopped. We didn’t even have aspersions of a cordial relationship, a silent, neutral one would have sufficed.

In it, I outlined where we are from and why we were living there. I didn’t feel the need to tell them how we bought our house with cash because seriously, people buy homes outright for lots of reasons, mostly *non* cartel related so I didn’t think it was relevant.

I told them we are very nice people and good neighbors if they’d just please consider not treating us and our property so badly, we could ignore each other and both be happy.

Crickets.

I put another copy of the letter in their mailbox two weeks later, just in case they didn’t see the first one for whatever reason.

A few days later, there’s a knock on our door and it’s the police. They said they had a complaint that we were stealing other people’s mail and messing with our neighbor’s mailbox. We were floored! I told them I know exactly who called them and explained the situation, even showing them a copy of the letter I sent twice. They weren’t concerned and just told us it’s best to not try and make peace, just ignore them the best we can. They suggested we put up security cameras so the neighbors can’t accuse us of anything in the future and went on their way.

The cops don’t care about a cut hose. Or someone “messing with mailboxes.” We put up a few cameras for our own safety and that’s all we had energy for.

DRS is working! It looks like hedgies ran out of cycles: how apes broke the dip machine and why Wen Moon is ̶j̶u̶s̶t̶ ̶a̶r̶o̶u̶n̶d̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶c̶o̶r̶n̶e̶r̶ already here.,"Hello, dear apes. Beard bet guy here with the urgent update (not fin advice).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# 0. Intro

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Yes, I know, it’s been ‘a couple of months’ already and it’s time for me to accept my transition from Thor with a nordic beard and “L’Oreal shampoo commercial”-like hair into the ‘bald guy from Brazzers’. To be honest, I’m ready to do that, and I do plan to cover this small FTD of mine not later than in a week, provided…

&#x200B;

GME doesn’t moon starting as of today/tomorow (of which I’m sure it will)! Why the hell am I so confident about it?

The key is [cycles](https://imgur.com/a/2PRxPQT), and particularly, how those are interpreted. Many of the honorable superstonkers have built complex theories about cycles based on FTDs primarily, the almighty Criand explored futures settlement, or for example Daily TA Pickle has T+69/ETF quarterlies formulas which I have also been following. The thing is, in my opinion, that we have been looking at the form of hedgies fuckery, and not its substance/ their intentions. The good news is, according to my interpretation of cycles, the shorters dickinsons have ran out of bullets yesterday (and DRS seems to have contributed to that immensely), which led them into the Ouroboros trap. There is only one exit from this trap, and it’s not on planet Earth. 🐻 with me, and I'll explain why I'm expecting violent bullish price action and Wen Moon’s soon second coming staring as of today!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# 1. Roses are red, fuckery is not everlasting

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Everyone here should remember u/Criand’s brilliant [TRSwaps DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/pb22oj/the_puzzle_pieces_of_quarterly_movements_equity/), where he backtracked the cycles and identified the relevance of futures’ rollovers for the cyclical bullruns throughout the year. And even though apes were expecting significant bullish price action in the beginning of September, the hedgies once again managed to play against the retail crowd expectations, using variety of tricks available to them. Let me put a relevant comment which u/_atworkdontsendnudes left under u/MauerAstronaut’s DD on Variance Swaps (another fascinating reading, give it a try):

https://preview.redd.it/vivxoxhmd6081.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=24d00139d510db6e21cfe3d2b0511c59eb288c21

Exactly! Those fuckery loving financial wizards engineers have too many instruments at their disposal which allowed them kicking the can down the road. Furthermore, in my opinion, while diving deep into in-depth financial constructs (which is cool and educating - my favorite leisure since Jan), apes neglected the most important factor which has been floating on the surface all this time - the **price action** and the **market participants’ psychology** underpinning it. While OTM puts, TRSs, ETFs shorting, etc. constitute the form of the fuckery, the price suppression is its substance. Shorters dickinsons have been manipulating broader market sentiment on GME through psychological cycles, which have been contracting to the point of no return. I'll illustrate that through my cycle count later.

&#x200B;

For now, let me say it straight. There are only two major things that I’m certain about GME’s price action.

&#x200B;

1. The price is wrong, bitch!
2. The cyclical price action which we have been observing since January must have been taken from the book ‘Market Psychology for Dummies’.
3. DRS is the way.
4. Hedgies r fuk.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# 2. Hedgies only want one thing, and it’s fucking disgusting

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Really, when I identified all of the structures below a couple of days ago, I just thought why didn’t I notice all those patterns and fractals earlier. Those are freaking obvious even for a five year old, and are gniwolb gnikcuf dmin. We were looking at the cycles through the false prism this whole time!

Without further ado, let’s get straight to the business, starting from:

[GME hourly chart, November 2021 price action.](https://preview.redd.it/jdqpdksed6081.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ca14ad247eaa03f55cb43d8ab58699a9bdcf7cf2)

This is where my discovery originated. As many of you did too, I observed the early Nov bullrun, playing with the chart and TA. I swear, I have seen this pattern so many times on GME this year, so I decided to dive deeper. Notice anything?

&#x200B;

Okay, I’ll tell you what you are looking at:

[Taken from the book ‘Market Psychology for Dummies’, hehe](https://preview.redd.it/3d81mgsbd6081.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eff897aac37cf629eb14f4e277d9cd80f2a684f3)

What you see above is the explanation of the emotional cycle which market participants (primarily unsophisticated ones) go through during a typical market cycle. This basic emotional pattern described above seems to be the root of the hedgies algo, which they use for the price suppression. Yes, the financial derivatives and complex fin-engineering constructs are their tools, but the market sentiment control is their main objective. And that’s understandable, as Jan events and the global retail GME obsession scared the shit out of them. The GG report showed us that the shorters dickinsons were not covering in January, and the sneeze was primarily caused by the retail buying pressure. And where did the retail buying pressure come from? That’s right, it was building up on the global retail hype, which, in turn, was caused by quadruple digit % price increase. The attention of the broader retail investors circles is the hedgies Kryptonite. Even though lately that attention has been pulverized elsewhere (SPY, creeptoe ATHs), GME cycles and its contraction indicate that RIP (Dumbass) is just around the corner, and that DIP machine is broken. Let’s take a closer look and analyze the psychological cycle via the November price action.

&#x200B;

***Apes, meet Cycle 2***

[GME hourly chart, \(the first half of\) November 2021 price action.](https://preview.redd.it/ta2lb1lyc6081.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48bcfb900aa3cd8fb6ed5d5a59946c06c566f333)

Please refer to GME hourly chart above, and pay attention to the following factors which are relevant for all of the examples discussed further:

&#x200B;

1. The ‘positive’, growth phase of the cycle takes up no more than 10 percent of the cycle as a whole (timewise). Those rapid, sharp runs are intensive and short-lived, which enables hedgiesrfuks adjusting their positions in a very precise and careful manner, avoiding broader retail investors circles’ FOMO, and going through optimism to euphoria stages with the speed of lightning.
2. Even if the bullrun caught investors’ attention, the rug is usually pulled violently, and the newcomers buyers are shaken out. This is where the ‘anxiety’ stage kicks in.
3. Then there is hedgies’ favorite stage: flat titties W-shaped consolidation, which covers all of the stages up to ‘depression’, and makes the financial asset unattractive.

&#x200B;

Let me ask you a simple question: would you invest in the asset that has its price declining/staying flat up to 90% of time? That’s how they kill the buy side. And with the latest options talk, how do you think the options perform through this type of cycle with nasty theta decay? [Bad](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/qvm5zd/i_lost_100k_on_gme_options_because_i_bag_held/).

Hedgies only want two things (pulling the rug and flat titties) and it’s fucking disgusting. Okay, I think you got the point. This very simple psychology based price action pattern is their main weapon, which allowed them to keep status quo throughout 2021. I used past simple for ‘allowed’ because the hedfucks seem to be no longer in control, let me explain why and let’s count the cycles.

Take a brief look at red/magenta/dark-pink (dafaq is this Crayon?) November cycle numbered 2 above. Two is its number in the sequence of cycles (7-6-5-4-3-2-1 - and yes, its the FINAL COUNTDOWN), I’ll keep number 1 for myself for a bit and we’ll come back to it later in the analysis, but you should be able to see its first (light purple) impulse wave on the chart above. **Cycle 2** lasted for about two weeks (**Nov 1 - Nov 15**).

&#x200B;

***Zoom out, rewind: Cycle 3***

[GME 4H chart, August 24 - October 30 price action.](https://preview.redd.it/ow9n6kc7c6081.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=132ca51b023feb21e6deac99a9ec0311c66ff796)

The orange cycle, 4H chart is the most appropriate timeframe for this one. Refer to the previous example (2) if you would like to go through the stages in-depth again and apply those here. Basically, it goes like impulse>fuckery>correction>relief uptrend>W-consolidation. **Cycle 3** lasted for about *two months* (**Aug 24 - Oct 30**) or 69 days exactly (noice!).

The most important factor that should be mentioned, is that DRS really took off in the first half of this cycle, in the middle of September and as you will see in the examples that follow - preceding **Cycle 4** (green) and **Cycle 5** (light blue), are when they managed to kick the can down the road in the most efficient way; each had the duration of three months, and the orange **Cycle 3** was the one to break this duration sequence. Coincidence? I think not, DRS is the way.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

***Zoom out, rewind: Cycle 4***

[GME daily chart, May 25 - August 23 price action.](https://preview.redd.it/067xcn6vb6081.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1539d31734fefbbb582edff17e63a87d9a4e1dba)

The green cycle with the second most severe correction phase (guess which cycle had the most violent correction phase?). The cycle is also the longest (**May 25 - Aug 23**), lasted for about *three months*.

&#x200B;

***Rewind: Cycle 5***

[GME daily chart, February 24 - May 24 price action.](https://preview.redd.it/ckrv9dxlb6081.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1fa2009d014d1be27b92d20490753043f7faf39a)

The light-blue cycle is the second longest. Lasted for *three months* exactly (**Feb 24 - May 24**).

&#x200B;

***Zoom in, Rewind: Cycle 6 (January Sneeze)***

[GME hourly chart, January 21 - February 24 price action.](https://preview.redd.it/kzhl277eb6081.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aee26a5995c3e6a2372169612f3a076296bbedb8)

The apes remember. The blue cycle.

Let’s pause here for a second, and have a minute of silence for hedgies, because they r utterly fuk.

Thank you, let’s continue.

&#x200B;

***Zoom out: Cycles combined, the bigger picture***

[GME daily chart, January 21 - November 17 price action. Simulation confirmed.](https://preview.redd.it/gbm5mf76b6081.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ac79c45e4767fcc1e21ed9079bea18da6b033da)

The pattern that is observable on every cycle (10% impulsive growth while readjusting shorts and 90% downtrend/flat trend) is designed to mess with the psychology of the broader retail investors circles, keeping them away from investing in the asset and controlling the buying pressure.

Looking back at all the cycles, there are several conclusions to be made based on the analysis. First, consider this sequence: one month (cycle 6) - three months (cycle 5) - three months (cycle 4) - two months (cycle 3) - two weeks (cycle 2). The fifth and the fourth cycles were the perfect, comfy zones for shorters dickinsons to kick the can down the road (through FTDs, ETFs shorting, DOOMPs, etc.), decay theta, and make GME unattractive as an investment vehicle forcing the flat trend while other assets were flourishing and reaching for ATHs. The orange cycle, in its turn, is where they see a middle finger from the retail in the form of DRS, and the duration of the cycle reflects hedgies’ pain (retail took their toys away from them): the fuckery’s duration is cut by a third. BUT WAIT, THERE’S MORE! The red cycle (2), which started in November, lasted only for two weeks! In my opinion, this radical cycles contraction is largely due to DRS, and an extremely vivid indication of the fact that DRS is working, and it’s working right now, forcing hedgies’ algos into the singularity point of no return.

&#x200B;

***Zoom out: Cycle 7 (Long Term)***

[GME weekly chart, January 21 - November 17 price action. Confirmation simulated.](https://preview.redd.it/wxuei4r1b6081.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f5632f28fdf0a6013640876a55e56d11c68a8d6)

Speaking of points of no return, take a look how GME competed exactly the same cycle on the weekly chart, and it is composed of the shorter term cycles, making Xzibit really proud. There is so much pressure on GME charts, on every level of it, it feels fucking nuclear. The best part about it all, is that the explosion is TODAY!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# III. The Ouroboros has bitten its tail

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Finally, **Cycle 1**! This is the moment for apes to ooh aah ooh aah, because it fucking started! The MOASS started while I’m finishing this post! Just like the cycles predicted.

[GME 5 minutes chart, November 15 price action.](https://preview.redd.it/cu76r11sa6081.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=35580f48d5bd88225a440267286419406dd760e1)

So, remember the cliff hanger about **Cycle 1** that I left in the beginning of the post? This is it! **Cycle 2** took two weeks to finish, cycle one only needed one day!

Just like **Cycle 0** yesterday:

[GME 5 minutes chart, November 16 price action.](https://preview.redd.it/m5lpw8gka6081.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=794bf9f04a6597e1f0dfb68e5a1cbe9d838afa2f)

It was yesterday, when Ouroboros has bitten its tail. Today’s price action is the MOASS unveiling.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR: hedgies r fuk, as apes forced them into the point of singularity with DRS, and looped the cycles hedgies used for psychological warfare against the retail and the Stonk. The explosion you are observing today is highly likely the consequence of DRS and the beginning of MOASS, as hedgies ran out of bullets and resources to short the Superstonk.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/qw21sp/drs_is_working_it_looks_like_hedgies_ran_out_of/,roman_axt,2021-11-17 20:44:08,9108,Superstonk

Trigger warnings: >!Death of a loved one, dark humor, coping/grieving!<

[WIBTAH for kicking my son out for making “dark humor” TikToks about our daughters death?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/155tjl7/wibtah_for_kicking_my_son_out_for_making_dark/) , posted on Friday, July 21st, to r/AITAH

My daughter (16F) died 7 months ago in a car accident. The other driver was speeding and weaving in and out of traffic like a maniac on the highway, ultimately hitting my babygirl. The driver died on impact, but she died 6 hours later in the hospital due to her injuries.

My wife and I attend individual therapy, as well as marriage counseling. It’s been extremely hard for both of us, but we have made considerable progress given the circumstances.

We begged our son to get therapy and go to family counseling with us, but he refused. He’s 19 and in college so we can’t force him to go. Our therapist gave us a list of warning signs to look out for, and he seemed to be coping well with the loss. We decided to let him grieve in his own way.

The issue is my wife discovered a video my son made that went viral on TikTok. It was reposted by another account.
It was a dark humor video. “Before and after getting my drivers license” which was her school picture and then a picture of her gravestone/totaled car. The 3000+ comments were extremely fucked up and had similar “jokes”.
We found his account which had more than one video like this. “Us then vs now” which had a baby photo of them and then cut to a selfie of him next to her hospital bed before she died. There were in total 5 different posts similar to this. Each similarly more disgusting.

My wife was inconsolable. She had a severe mental breakdown. I had to take her to the ER so she can be sedated and given fluids due to her vomiting and hyperventilating.

I confronted my son, who defended himself saying he uses these videos to “cope” with her death. That “dark humor” is the way he grieves. I could barley look at him. I told him to pack his things and stay with his grandparents. He was angry and said we both need to “move the fuck on” and stop taking our grieve out on him.

It’s been 2 weeks and my wife doesn’t want to be anywhere near my son anytime soon. I can’t say I disagree. It’s been about giant 10 steps back for both our grieving process.

Our son gone was supposed to be temporary, but my wife and I think it’s time for him move into an off-campus student apartment to give us all some space and establish boundaries. We haven’t told him this yet, but plan to when he returns home next week.

While he was away he did apologize in a text to both my wife and I. However he still insists it wasn’t wrong for him to post those videos publicly for millions of people to see. He believes we are being too dramatic and taking it too personal. It took me threatening to disown him before he took down the videos.

A few of my friends thinks we are going too far by essentially abandoning him and kicking him out of our home. They said to keep in mind he’s still a stupid kid, and he’s digging in his heels because he wants attention.

We’ll be paying for his rent, but he will have to cover the other costs himself (food, gas) since that’s the most we can afford right now. He will have to get a part-time job while going to class.

We still love our son but neither of us can handle this right now for the sake of our marriage and mental health. Honestly I think I need to put my wife first here, and if that means he needs to leave then I’ll do that for her. Plus he’s 19 (turning 20 soon), so it’s not like he’s a child…

WIBTAH?

Comments that OP cited in their update

Agoraphobe961
> NTA. Using his sister’s death for internet clout is disgusting
> Edit to add: he took a selfie with his sister on life support, there’s a time and place ffs. He also gave a text apology, then doubled down and called his parents dramatic and refused to take down the videos even though they triggered his mom into an ER visit. He said his parents were taking it too personally. IT’S ABOUT THEIR DAUGHTER, it’s literally almost the most personal thing you can get.


u/CashMikey
>> Where in the world does this confidence that clout was the most important thing coming from? Kids his age live their lives on social media in a way that makes me extremely uncomfortable. But it doesn't take much time on TikTok to know that it's a part of life for them now, it's a core part of the way many teenagers experience and interact with the world, and it's not just for ""clout""
>> This kid is apparently just selfish and lacks empathy and wants to increase his social media following, but there's nothing in the post that indicates:

>> * He said a single fucking word about likes, followers, or anything that indicated those things were important to him

>> * That his father ever asked him ""How is this helping you son? Why is it important to you to express yourself this way? What about this makes it easier for you to deal with your sister's death?""

>> People up and down this thread are diagnosing him as a psychopath, saying he has a personality disorder, etc. and it's fucking bonkers. We have no idea why he felt this was an important way for him to grieve, and the folks labelling him this that and the other thing are accusing HIM of lacking empathy. That's exactly fucking backwards.

>> It may ultimately be that the son's a complete dickhead, that he really doesn't care how these things impact his parents and he just wants likes and followers. But the information we have here is so far away from proving that, unless you are choosing to project your own hatred of social media culture onto this one person.

>> Ultimately, this sequence of events can also be accurately described as:

>> * 19 year old loses his sister

>> * 19 year old finds comfort in posting dark humor about his sister

>> * Parents find them and become extremely upset. Dad confronts the kid and after the kid defends himself, asks no follow up questions about why it's helping him and makes no further effort to understand, but kicks him out of the house, becoming so angry with his son that he can't even look at him. I'd bet every penny I have the son knew exactly what his father felt towards him in that moment, and it sure as hell wasn't love or empathy.

>> * Only then, by the way, does the kid lash out (""move the fuck on"") at the parents. After his father has reached the point where he is treating him with nothing but anger. The son was not the person who escalated away from a place of familial love here. That's an important detail.

>> Everyone in this thread who is so gleefully tagging this kid with every name or psychological disorder in the book should take a deep fucking breath and consider who really lacks empathy here.

>> I feel deeply for the father but the way he's lashing out at his son is ultimately on him and he is risking losing a second child because of his grief over the first. I won't call him the AH, I think all parties involved deserve some grace to figure out such a brutal situation. NAH, but I really hope OP reconsiders his stance towards this and seeks to understand his son a bit better. I think he will ultimately regret it if he doesn't.


u/Potential-Cloud-801
>>> Grace. Such an amazing thing. It can move mountains. I agree, don’t cut your son off. He may feel very alone right now.


u/genredenoument
>>> I cannot upvote this enough. As a parent of 20, 24, and 27 year old men, they are very different than than we were at that age. They live an online life. The pandemic made this even worse. I wouldn't expect a 19 year old male who is separated from his family in college and going through the complete breakdown of a family TO post something psychologically balanced, thoughtful, and reasonable. I have seen worse coping behavior from grown adults. They just don't post it on TikTok. The mother's behavior was a complete breakdown and inability to function to the point of hospitalization, and everyone is pointing fingers at a 19 year old? I think this entire family is struggling. Expecting a 19 year old to have the emotional intelligence to cope with not only the loss of his only sibling, but essentially his family is unreasonable. Most people are looking at this through the lenses of far more adult experience, which is just not fair. The parents' reaction was neither reasoned, mature, or empathic, and they're more than twice his age. These parents appear to have a lot of unresolved anger, and their son has become a target for their rage. Yes, his post was hurtful, but people do stupid things in grief. His parents are right now. Just because they don't understand it doesn't make it wrong. Everyone needs to take a big step back before this family implodes. Grief and anger mix to make a toxic and blinding combination that often destroys the relationships of those going through it. I hope these parents don't lose a second child in the process.


u/thoughtfulchick
>>> NTAH overall OP but did you say to your son that you are there for him if he needs you? Did you tell him that you are sorry that your and his mother's grief has so overwhelmed you? Did you tell him that you love him?

>>> He is still alive. And he's hurting too. So, he's NTAH either. He's just trying to cope same as you two. However, you and your wife have each other. He has no one. Especially now. Stay in touch, rein in your anger and have some empathy for him. He is your child and he lost his sister, and his parents.

>>> I am very sorry for your loss.

u/LoafOf_Bread
> First of all, I am so sorry for your loss. My heart goes out to you and your family.
I just want to add my two cents: I’m a teacher who gets along pretty well with my students (middle school and high school level) so they are always showing me or sending me tik toks or explaining new trends to me.

> These dark humor-style Tik toks about a deceased relative are actually more common than you’d think. Your son is not the only person who has made them, and they are genuinely legitimate ways of coping with traumatic loss. I totally understand and empathize with your reaction, but I just want to make the case that people from the younger generation are not always making Tik toks like this out of disrespect, and they’re not always making light of a serious situation.

> In this case, it’s pretty hard to justify him saying you need to “move the fuck on,” but I wonder if that is an example of him suppressing his grief, rather than him not feeling any. Again I’m not defending him, just suggesting another explanation for how his 19-year-old brain (the brain doesn’t finish developing until ~25 years old) might be dealing with this.

> As a final thought, our generation and the younger generation view mental health differently. That’s just a fact. In the same way that you might see this as an inappropriate and unhealthy way to respond to grief, keep in mind that your way of responding to grief might look just as insane to him.


u/Chemical_Act_7648
> NTA

> If you're paying for university or his housing, you should make it a condition of continued funding to go to therapy.

> It's not so much the videos that are the problem, and they aren't great, but his reaction to you shows a real lack of maturity and empathy. And if he is cognizant of the fact that the videos are some kind of coping mechanism, well there are more healthy ways to cope... like therapy.

> Hopefully one day he will understand and deeply regret his actions.
​
> I'm so very very sorry for your loss, I can't imagine anything worse and if I lost my daughter there would be nothing left, I'd be gone. So I wish you great strength, she was a beautiful person.

OOP
> Thank you for your input. I think requiring him to have some sort of therapy for funding is an excellent idea. I’ll definitely speak this over with my wife.

> Truthfully my wife and I are barley holding on most days, but therapy has been such huge help through this process. I suspect we’d both be divorced and dead by now if not for our support system.

> Thank you for your kind words. My daughter was incredibly beautiful and strong. She was a force to reckoned with. I know if she was here with us right now she’d be slapping her brother upside the head using some VERY colorful language. She was never afraid to speak her mind, and was opinionated to a fault. Despite her hard exterior she was deeply emotional and empathetic.

> A few months before she died we discovered a stray cat she was hiding in her bedroom. I had to put on my “dad voice” and reprimand her, but of course we kept the little dude. He still waits by the front door everyday at 3:00pm, waiting for her to get home from school. He ignored everyone but my daughter. He would act like a lapcat, follow her around the house and sleep with her every night. He just recently started letting my wife hold him. Still hisses at me though.

> Also, even though she was a B/C student, she was SO smart. She taught herself Python. She begged us to enroll her into a coding camp for her summer break. She wanted to be a game developer and make games like Animal Crossing and a farming game (I forget the name now). She was so smart and loving. I miss her everyday. She was sarcastic, witty and hilarious. A pessimist like me with a heart of gold. She loved people and had tons of friends, and could talk to anyone and everyone for hours.

> EDIT: I’m sorry I went on a bit of a tangent there.

[[FINAL UPDATE] WIBTAH for kicking my son out for making “dark humor” TikToks about our daughter’s death?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1565i1g/final_update_wibtah_for_kicking_my_son_out_for/) updated later that day.

Firstly, I’d like to send a sincere thank you to everyone who not only commented, but read my original post. This is a very dark and vulnerable time for my family. We are lost, confused and battling with a grief that has consumed us so entirely it hurts to physically breathe most days.

Secondly, my son is a good man, son and brother. He loved and cherished his sister deeply, and I know in my heart that it was never his intention to make light of her death. Nor would he ever intentionally hurt his mother, myself or anyone.

It’s been an emotionally exhausting and draining last few hours for both my family and I. However, I am happy to provide a bittersweet update for all the wonderful people who took the time to read my original post. You all helped me realize I needed to act now and fast if I were to ever repair our family.

I called my son on the phone after reading the comments. I asked him why he posted those videos. He said he was just hurting. We were quiet for a while. His voice broke when he asked if me and his mom still love him.

I failed my son. I failed him. What he needed was a father who gave unconditional love, support and protection. He needed his dad. I was too stupid, selfish and angry to see he was hurting more deeply than any of us. We lost our daughter, but he had lost his sister.

We needed him to be the strong, mature son for his broken parents. The brave one. The one to shoulder our pain. We took his cry for help as him kicking us while we were down.

My wife and I immediately left to go pick him up and bring him home. What I saw was a broken little boy needing his mom and dad. Not the pathological monster our grief painted him as. He had visible bags under his eyes and lost a lot of weight. We were too blind to see it.

We both profusely apologized and will be showing him how sorry we are for the rest of our lives. We vowed to do right by him. We all cried together on the couch for a while.

Our son is taking a year off of school to heal and work on his mental health by his request. He also agreed to attending weekly therapy. He will be home with us.

We will also be seeing a family therapist. My wife is seeking medication to get a handle on her panic attacks. I signed up for a grief support group specifically for fathers.

This is all just a start for a very long and difficult journey ahead of us.

Thank you everyone for giving me a major kick in the ass and a wake up call. I may have lost a daughter, but I will not be losing my son. Not now or ever again.

[Editor’s Note: OOP thanks the users whose comments were shared above, and also thanked several users who shared their own stories of loss, whose comments I chose not to include for the sake of not making this even heavier than it already is.]

———————————————————————

This community can move mountains, and affect the lives of real people facing real issues. I’ve learned a lot about what grief means for different people. No one’s grief is invalid or wrong, and everyone handles it differently. This is a lesson I’ll carry with me for the rest of my life.

This morning I am making pancakes and bacon while my son and my wife watch Netflix in the family room. The windows are open. Our daughter’s cat actually came out of her room on her own for the first time to lay on the couch with them.

Our lazy Saturday. It’s the first time in months we did this since our daughter passed. It feels bittersweet. Different. But at the same time, it feels right too.
Reminder: I am not the OOP. OOP is u/Puppy_Cat_Boots, who went through an immense, unimaginable tragedy and is doing his absolute best as a father and husband to keep himself and his family afloat, and doing pretty damned well all things considered.

[OC] Introducing the unicorn index: defining player uniqueness,"This post has a few graphs. If you don't want to click on each one individually, they're all in an imgur album [here](https://imgur.com/a/Yo9JfKd).

There is no tl;dr, but there's a link with results at the end of the post.

#Introduction

Each year, more and more “unicorns” enter the league. Many define unicorns to be unique big men, including Giannis, Jokic, or Porzingis. A unicorn big man will have some strong quality that’s uncommon among the typical big. For Giannis, it’s ball-handling and speed. For Jokic, it’s passing. For Porzingis, it’s a mix of shooting and mobility.

As more unicorn-like players enter the league, some lose their uniqueness. For example, a decade ago, a player like Porzingis would be unheard of. But, with the prevalence of stretch 5s today, he’s not as unique as we’d expect. To answer this question of how unique a player truly is, we’ll create the unicorn index.

The unicorn index measures the distance of a player’s stats from the average stats of the players in his position. This creates a metric of uniqueness for each player.

***

#Methods

First, we collected 70 different statistics from both Basketball-Reference and NBA.com/Stats. These range from common counting and advanced stats to tracking stats such as touches and drives.

Adding the tracking stats from NBA.com helps us differentiate between players more. For example, only using PPG makes two bigs scoring 20 PPG seem similar. But, if one scores all his points off catch & shoot buckets and the other scores all his points off post plays, they’re distinct players.

The two tables below show the stats we collected.

|Basic shooting stats|Basic counting stats|Holistic advanced stats|Specific advanced stats|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|FG|ORB|PER|TS%|
|FGA|DRB|OWS|3PAr|
|FG%|TRB|DWS|FTr|
|3P|AST|WS|ORB%|
|3PA|STL|WS/48|DRB%|
|3P%|BLK|OBPM|TRB%|
|2P|TOV|DBPM|AST%|
|2PA|PF|BPM|STL%|
|2p%|PTS|VORP|BLK%|
|eFG%|MP||TOV%|
|FT|||USG%|
|FTA||||
|FT%||||

|General touch stats|Specific touch stats|Specific shooting stats|Defense stats|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|TOUCHES|ELBOW_TOUCHES|DRIVE_PTS|DFGM|
|FRONT_CT_TOUCHES|POST_UPS|DRIVE_FG%|DFGA|
|TIME_OF_POSS|PAINT_TOUCHES|C&S_PTS|DFG%|
|AVG_SEC_PER_TOUCH|PTS_PER_ELBOW_TOUCH|C&S_FG%| |
|AVG_DRIB_PER_TOUCH|PTS_PER_POST_TOUCH|PULL_UP_PTS| |
|PTS_PER_TOUCH|PTS_PER_PAINT_TOUCH|PULL_UP_FG%| |
|||PAINT_TOUCH_PTS| |
|||PAINT_TOUCH_FG%| |
|||POST_TOUCH_PTS| |
|||POST_TOUCH_FG%| |
|||ELBOW_TOUCH_PTS| |
|||ELBOW_TOUCH_FG%| |

The first table consists of stats collected from Basketball-Reference. The second table consists of stats collected from NBA.com/Stats. The general and specific touch stats are under “player tracking touches”. The specific shooting stats are under “player tracking shooting efficiency”. The defense stats are under “player tracking defense.”

After collecting the stats, we marked the players into positions. However, these positions were not the typical 5 positions. Instead, we separated players into guards, wings, and bigs. We also restricted the data to players who played at least 41 games and 10 MPG. Note that we used 2017-18 stats for Porzingis (injury) and Davis (trade saga).

To create the unicorn index, we will not calculate player-by-player distance among these raw stats. This would be somewhat useless, as many of the stats relate to each other. For example, VORP is a minutes-scaled stat of BPM, so we can predict it using BPM and MPG. Many of the stats are the sum of other stats (such as WS = OWS + DWS).

Having inter-related stats makes some stats useless. If we know some information, then knowing other related stats won’t give us more information about a player. So, we must first find a way to remove the relationships between these stats.

***

#Principal component analysis

To make the stats independent, we’ll use something called principal component analysis (PCA). PCA transforms our data into uncorrelated components that still capture the variance of our initial data set. So, this lets us have fewer data points to consider while still encapsulating most of the data set.

Each component has no physical meaning in a basketball game. However, raw stats compose these components. So, we can see what stats contributed to each component the most. This will give us an initial idea of what differentiates players within a position.

With each extra component, we can explain more of the data’s variance. So, there are a couple different ways to pick the number of components (n_components). Some optimize n_components like marginal utility. They pick n_components based on benefit in explained variance vs. the previous n_components. However, we’re not concerned with having a very small n_components. So, we’ll say we want enough components to explain a certain percent of the variance. In this case, we’ll pick 90%. There is no specific reason for this; the analysis would work just as well if we explained 95% of the variance.

Because each position has different stats, we’ll do the PCA on each position. The graph below shows the explained variance ratio for each position with varying n_components.

https://i.imgur.com/5pmiMOy.png

For guards and bigs, the explained variance reaches 90% when n_components = 15. For wings, the explained variance reaches 90% when n_components = 13. This means it’s easier to differentiate between wings than guards and bigs, as it takes fewer components to capture the same amount of variance. Intuitively, we would expect this. There’s a lot more variety in wings than in guards or bigs. For example, most guards shoot, and most bigs can’t. Meanwhile, it’s mixed for wings, where some wings are league’s best shooters, while others don’t shoot.

So, we’ll proceed with n_components = 15 for guards and bigs, and n_components = 13 for wings.

##Factor loadings

Each component has a factor loading, or how much our initial raw stats affected the component. This doesn’t matter for the sake of the unicorn index but it’s interesting to look at.

The factor loadings show us the composition of each component. So, the factor loadings for the first component are the first differentiating factor between players in the same position. For example, if these factors were 3P%, PTS, and EFG% in component 1 then shooting is the first differentiating factor. If component 2 had STL, BLK, and DBPM, then we know that after controlling for shooting, defense was the biggest differentiating factor. This follows for the rest of the components. Unfortunately, factor loadings won’t always group together like this. But, we will often see some trends.

Let’s look at the top 5 factor loadings for each component in the guards PCA. They are not in order of greatest to least impact on each component because the difference in effect is tiny.  

|Component #|Factor 1|Factor 2|Factor 3|Factor 4|Factor 5|
--:|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|1|2P|FGA|PER|FG|PTS|
|2|TOV%|3P%|TS%|C&amp;S_PTS|3P|
|3|TIME_OF_POSS|AVG_SEC_PER_TOUCH|AST%|AVG_DRIB_PER_TOUCH|PAINT_TOUCH_PTS|
|4|3PA|PF|DRIVE_FG%|2P%|FG%|
|5|STL%|BPM|PTS_PER_TOUCH|WS/48|DBPM|
|6|ELBOW_TOUCHES|BLK%|ELBOW_TOUCH_FG%|FTr|PTS_PER_TOUCH|
|7|STL%|POST_TOUCH_FG%|DRB%|PTS_PER_ELBOW_TOUCH|ELBOW_TOUCH_FG%|
|8|PAINT_TOUCH_FG%|ELBOW_TOUCH_FG%|PTS_PER_ELBOW_TOUCH|FTr|PTS_PER_POST_TOUCH|
|9|PULL_UP_FG%|DRB%|DFG%|PAINT_TOUCH_FG%|PTS_PER_PAINT_TOUCH|
|10|POST_TOUCH_PTS|TRB%|DRB%|3P%|POST_UPS|
|11|PTS_PER_ELBOW_TOUCH|PAINT_TOUCH_FG%|ELBOW_TOUCH_FG%|PTS_PER_POST_TOUCH|POST_TOUCH_FG%|
|12|STL%|PULL_UP_FG%|2P%|FT%|ELBOW_TOUCH_FG%|
|13|FTr|PAINT_TOUCH_FG%|DFGM|PTS_PER_ELBOW_TOUCH|DFG%|
|14|PAINT_TOUCH_FG%|ELBOW_TOUCH_FG%|ORB%|POST_UPS|POST_TOUCH_PTS|
|15|2P%|DRIVE_FG%|STL%|C&amp;S_FG%|DFG%|

We see that the first differentiating factor between guards is offensive production. After controlling for offensive production, shooting becomes the biggest differentiating factor. After controlling for both offensive production and shooting, ball handling becomes most important. The subsequent components have less of a clear connection between the factors. This is because we have so many touches-related stats and fewer defensive stats. So, we’d expect most groups to have some touch-related stats. This makes it unlikely to find a component composed of only defensive stats.

Next, let’s look at the top 5 factor loadings for each component in the wings PCA.

|Component #|Factor 1|Factor 2|Factor 3|Factor 4|Factor 5|
--:|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|1|FTA|FGA|PER|PTS|FG|
|2|TRB%|ORB|BLK%|DBPM|ORB%|
|3|3P%|FG%|eFG%|TS%|2P%|
|4|PF|3PA|PTS_PER_POST_TOUCH|PTS_PER_PAINT_TOUCH|3PAr|
|5|DFGA|DBPM|DFGM|TOV%|AST%|
|6|PTS_PER_POST_TOUCH|DFGM|PF|ELBOW_TOUCH_FG%|PTS_PER_ELBOW_TOUCH|
|7|PTS_PER_ELBOW_TOUCH|BLK|TRB%|DRB%|STL%|
|8|PTS_PER_ELBOW_TOUCH|STL%|POST_TOUCH_FG%|PTS_PER_TOUCH|BLK%|
|9|PTS_PER_PAINT_TOUCH|POST_TOUCH_PTS|PTS_PER_POST_TOUCH|PAINT_TOUCH_FG%|POST_TOUCH_FG%|
|10|PTS_PER_POST_TOUCH|STL|TRB%|STL%|DRB%|
|11|PTS_PER_POST_TOUCH|ELBOW_TOUCH_FG%|PTS_PER_ELBOW_TOUCH|DRIVE_FG%|FTr|
|12|BLK%|ORB|BLK|ORB%|DRB%|
|13|POST_TOUCH_FG%|PTS_PER_PAINT_TOUCH|DFGM|PULL_UP_FG%|DFG%|

For wings, it seems that the first differentiating factor is offensive production, as it was for guards. Following offensive production, we see that defense and rebounding are important. Then, shooting is the next differentiating factor. After that, it becomes a bit less clear.

Finally, let’s look at the top 5 factor loadings for each component in the bigs PCA.

|Component #|Factor 1|Factor 2|Factor 3|Factor 4|Factor 5|
--:|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|1|TRB|PER|FG|2P|2PA|
|2|FG%|C&amp;amp;S_PTS|ORB%|3P|3PA|
|3|AST|TOV%|PTS_PER_TOUCH|AST%|PTS_PER_ELBOW_TOUCH|
|4|OBPM|2P%|TS%|eFG%|PAINT_TOUCH_FG%|
|5|DRIVE_PTS|AVG_DRIB_PER_TOUCH|AVG_SEC_PER_TOUCH|DFGA|BLK|
|6|POST_TOUCH_PTS|FTr|DRIVE_FG%|PULL_UP_FG%|C&amp;amp;S_FG%|
|7|OBPM|DBPM|BLK|BLK%|DFG%|
|8|PTS_PER_TOUCH|TOV%|STL|STL%|DRB%|
|9|2P%|ELBOW_TOUCH_FG%|POST_TOUCH_FG%|PAINT_TOUCH_FG%|DRIVE_FG%|
|10|STL%|PF|ELBOW_TOUCH_FG%|PTS_PER_POST_TOUCH|POST_TOUCH_FG%|
|11|POST_UPS|MP|PULL_UP_FG%|DRIVE_FG%|ELBOW_TOUCH_FG%|
|12|FTr|DRB|DRB%|TRB%|PULL_UP_FG%|
|13|PTS_PER_ELBOW_TOUCH|PF|TOV%|DRIVE_FG%|PAINT_TOUCH_FG%|
|14|STL|C&amp;amp;S_FG%|PAINT_TOUCH_FG%|STL%|FT%|
|15|PTS_PER_POST_TOUCH|C&amp;amp;S_FG%|POST_TOUCH_FG%|PTS_PER_ELBOW_TOUCH|PF|

Like wings and guards, bigs differentiate themselves by their offensive production first. However, rebounding was also one of the most important factors in the first component. Following offensive production, it seems that shooting was the biggest differentiating factor. This seems surprising at first but it makes sense. Bigs should have the widest range of shooters to non-shooters because some players shoot a lot, while others don’t shoot at all. Following shooting, it seems that ball-handling/facilitation was the next most important factor. This follows the same reasoning as shooting; many bigs don’t pass at all or get touches, but some are among the best passers in the league and touch the ball often (Jokic, Giannis, etc.).

This gives us a general idea of the composition of the principal components.

#Calculating the unicorn index

Calculating the unicorn index from the components has a couple steps. Before we jump in, we’ll want to describe the metrics we’re using.

##Distance metrics composing the index

To calculate the unicorn index, we'll use three different distance metrics. They are:

1. Euclidean distance. The Euclidean distance between two vectors (lists of values) equals the square root of the sum of their squared differences. Essentially, if we have two lists, p and q, of 3 elements, their Euclidean distance will be the square root of (p_1 – q_1)^2 + (p_2 – q_2)^2 + (p_3 – q_3)^2 where p_n and q_n are the nth elements the vector.
2. Manhattan distance (or city block/taxicab distance). The Manhattan distance between two vectors equals the sum of the absolute values of their differences. So, the only difference between this and Euclidean distance is that Euclidean distance squares these differences then takes the square root, giving us some different values. So, the Manhattan distance of two lists, p and q, of 3 elements will be |p_1 – q_1| + |p_2 – q_2| + |p_3 – q_3|
3. Chebyshev distance. The Chebyshev distance between two vectors equals the maximum difference between corresponding coordinates in the vectors. So, if we have two lists, p and q, of 3 elements and the difference between p_1 and q_1 (|p_1 – q_1|) is the greatest difference between elements, the Chebyshev distance will equal |p_1 – q_1|.

##Calculation of distance

From the positional PCA data, we took the average of each component. This gave us a list of values that the “average” guard, wing, or big will have. Then, we calculated each player’s distance to these values. In each metric, a higher value indicates a higher distance from the positional average. A distance of 0 indicates that the player is perfectly average.

The graphs below show the Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, and Chebyshev distance for guards.

https://i.imgur.com/wItmnkJ.png

https://i.imgur.com/qttPjkL.png

https://i.imgur.com/VLf8gdU.png

The same 3 players ranked top 3 in each metric: James Harden, Russell Westbrook, and Ben Simmons. Westbrook and Simmons do have very unconventional stats for a guard.

However, we would not expect Harden to be “unique” for a guard. Because we’re measuring distance, someone could have a high distance by being amazing. So, even though Harden isn’t a “unicorn” by definition, his stats were so unique that he received a high score. We’ll notice this trend again later for other players.

Now, let’s look at these distances for wings. The three graphs below show the distances for wings.

Here, we see a pretty similar thing where the top 3 players (LeBron, Durant, George) all happen to be among the best wings. So, this contributes to them having a high “distance.” Still, they are all unique players. LeBron’s passing, Durant’s scoring, and George’s defense are all special for wings. Note that some of the more odd players here (like Svi Mykhailiuk) made it in because they are barely over the minutes and games played boundary. For example, Mykhailiuk played 42 games and 10.5 MPG. So, his stats are much worse than most players in the data set, making him technically unique.

Now, let’s look at the same results for bigs.

Here, we see that the common unicorn players do have the top distances. Intuitively, we’d expect the bigs to have the easiest to understand distances where the most distant players are both good and unique. This is because guards and wings are generally well-rounded. So, a high-distance guard or wing is either extremely unique (like Ben Simmons) or very good. Meanwhile, because a lot of bigs don’t shoot, pass, or dribble often, it’s easy for a player to differentiate themselves if they do one of these things well. Then, if a player does one of these things well as a big, they’re probably very good.

Now that we’ve seen how each distance metric ranks the players, we can create the final unicorn index.

##Converting distances to the unicorn index

To convert these distances to the unicorn index, we’ll first normalize them between 0 and 1. So, the player with the highest distance in each metric for each position will receive a 1. The player with the lowest distance will receive a 0. For the rest of the players, the distribution remains as it was initially, but shifts between 0 and 1. This will let us compare the distances; we can’t do that now because they’re scaled differently. For example, notice that the Manhattan distance is always higher.

Scaling these distances will also give us a way to compare players across positions. It happens to be that in the raw distance metrics, guards had a wider range.

After scaling each distance, we can then take the average of the 3 distances to give us the unicorn index. The unicorn index is between 0 and 1. A player receiving a 1 means they had the highest distance from the average for their position in all 3 of our distance metrics. Therefore, they are the most unique player in that position.

The three graphs below show the unicorn index for guards, wings, and bigs.

Giannis was the only player to get a unicorn index of 1, meaning he is the most unique player in the NBA. Meanwhile, Tyler Johnson is the least unique player in the NBA.

The Google Sheet below gives the unicorn index for every player who played at least 10 MPG and 41 games last year. The positional rank is how high the given player’s unicorn index ranks among players in their position. Next to the unicorn index, we have the normalized distance metrics. The unicorn index is the average of these normalized metrics. The Google Sheet is available here:

#Conclusion

The unicorn index spotted some conventional unicorns, while also bringing to light how unique some great players are. For example, Harden’s skill set isn’t unheard-of for a guard, but his production is very unique.

We can apply this same process to the league’s entire history to find the most unique player ever. We can also apply this to each player’s individual seasons relative to all player seasons in NBA history. This would give us the most unique season in NBA history. My bet for this would be some of Wilt’s seasons. If we restricted it to the 3-point era, maybe Curry’s unanimous MVP season would be the most unique.

PLEASE UNDERSTAND why Robinhood pulled the stunt they did today. The big money shorts are out of shares and out of capital. We were on the cusp of triggering a full-blown infinite squeeze. The nuclear bomb of squeezes.,"I put the following on r/WallStreetBets, but I can share it here, too.

- - - - - - 

I'm glad this place has quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall.  Disclaimer: I am that monkey.  Let me explain to you what happened, play by play.  I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front: **We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market.** Do I have your attention?  Here goes:

1. Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570.  Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again?  Really?  We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock.  This creates upwards pressure on the market.  We've been seeing these movements all week.

2. Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off.  It didn't work.

3. Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options.  You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so.  Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.

4. Today, the market opened very strong.  It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.

5. At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.

6. Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.

7. The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: **The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it.**  What does that mean?  It means they ran out of shares and/or capital.  They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.  I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said **a small sell limit order executed at $2600 for him.**  Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true?  It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.  It means virtually any ask was getting bid.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure?  A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted.  The call writers need shares to hedge.  Retail is still buying more.  The short sellers need over 100% of the float back.  Add these together.  There were more shares needed than existed on the open market.  That's what a liquidity crisis is.

Listen to [this remarkable (if infuriating) interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM) where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home.  **DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""?** Hello!  He's not talking about the market for GME shares.  He's talking about the entire market!  The New York Stock Exchange.  The NASDAQ.  All that.

Remember the movie *Snowpiercer*?  Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets?  Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o

It kick starts a full blown rebellion.  They have no bullets.  It's the exact same in this market:  No capital.  No shares.  Infinite losses inbound.

**TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares.  Do you get that?  HOLD.  Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede.  That's how we win.**  

They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them.  They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating.  They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/l7dg4s/please_understand_why_robinhood_pulled_the_stunt/,PlayFree_Bird,2021-01-29 05:10:59,8638,GME
THE POPCORN / BUFFETT HEDGE: A Weapon of Financial Mass Destruction,"Some of you may have seen [my recent post about VW](https://old.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ufnf7y/the_bigger_short_vw_squeeze_had_more_to_do_with/) over the weekend, or [my older post about the ""BRK Indicator""](https://old.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/rw79so/berkshire_hathaway_is_an_indicator_of_gme_spikes/). This post will expound on these as GME relates to Berkshire Hathaway. 

NOTE: This is all based on visual pattern recognition from charts I will provide. The following is simply my own opinion/theory on what I see, and is not backed by any hard data aside from charts and letters/interviews/articles with Buffet/Kenny and other past GME research. If anyone wants to do a more quantitative analysis of this type of work, please have at it. This is not that. I'm not a quant. I have asked some quants to take a look when they have time, including pwn. 

##**BACKGROUND INFORMATION**

I imagine most apes here have at least heard of Warren Buffett, value investor extraordinaire, and one of the richest men in the world. He was a disciple of famed value investor Benjamin Graham, whose teachings have influenced all the value investors since, including our very own DFV. Warren Buffett is the head of a company called Berkshire Hathaway (BRK). BRK is an interesting company: it basically just owns other companies. They own huge chunks of Apple, Coke, and Geico, to name a few. 

Warren Buffett's image is carefully crafted to be that of a kindly old grandpa. He still lives in the same small house he purchased a billion years ago in Omaha, Nebraska. He buys breakfast at McDonald's and counts the change out like a normal person (he could buy all of McDonald's if he really wanted to). He only invests in good companies he truly believes in and holds them for eternity. Warren Buffett is the OG Diamond Hands. However, I submit, based on the evidence I'm about to show, that Mr. Buffett more closely resembles Montgomery Burns than an elderly Captain America.  

Here's some of what Warren Buffett has had to say about short selling over the years: 

>	It's a whole lot easier to make money on the long side. You can't make big money shorting because the risk of big losses means you can't make big bets. It's ruined a lot of people. You can go broke doing it.

Nice, so he doesn't like shorts. Ok cool. What else has he said about shorts?  

>I would welcome people wanting to short Berkshire. In fact, I'd lend them stock and earn extra income. They're a certain future buyer. If anyone wants to naked-short Berkshire, they can do it until the cows come home. In fact, we'll hold a special meeting for them.""

Moreover, Buffett has used this share-lending strategy with some of his other companies. The Berkshire CEO related a story in which a large brokerage company approached Buffett wanting to borrow USG (USG) stock to sell short. 

>""We charged them a lot,"" Buffett said. ""We even forced them to hold it for a certain period of time so we could continue to earn money on the borrow.""

Buffett has said a lot about shorts over the years, but this is sufficient for our discussion here.

##**A Brief Primer on Currency Pairs**

A currency pair is basically one currency traded against another, for example, EUR/USD = 1.25 means one Euro is worth 1.25 USD. The thing is, you can do these sort of pairings with any two stocks. For example, here's a period of time in 2019-2020 where we have GME (Yellow) and POPCORN (Blue). GME/POPCORN is shown in green. You can best conceptualize this trade as **LONG** GME and **SHORT** POPCORN. It's like a hedge, make sense? 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/yWCHab2V/

These pairings can be of interest to traders because they can show when one stock might start to breakaway from others it usually moves with. Maybe you want to compare CPU STOCK #2 to the Nasdaq index, for example.  

https://www.tradingview.com/x/4AMVe4Q0/

In this example, you can see that in the past few days, CPU STOCK #2 has started to trend upward against the index, meaning it might be a good time to jump in. Sure enough, the stock is rising compared to its peers. 

So, what does this have to do with GME?

##**POPCORN IS GME'S LEASH**

Remember that chart of GME vs Popcorn from 2019-2020?  Looked like a normal, kinda squigly chart. Well, take a look at what has happened to the pairing in 2021-2022:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/XWceMNCy/

Do you guys see this?  Starting in June, Popcorn and GME suddenly became *very* closely linked. Since then, the two stocks have always traded within a certain range of each other. A good friend of mine observed that POPCORN often acts like a ""leash"" on GME, and this is exactly what is shown in this pairing. Neither stock can escape the confines of the lane they're trading together in. What we are seeing here is very likely the result of a **SWAP** where Kenny (or Susquehanna, or whoever) took their GME short position and swapped it with an POPCORN long position to hedge the short position. They don't have to report this long position because swaps don't have to be reported. Then they pay to promote POPCORN on social media and here we are. 

But wait, there's more. 

##**BUFFET ENTERS THE CHAT**

Wrinkles have known about the GME/POPCORN chart pair thing for a while. We've looked at it and seen how they're leashed together into a certain range since June, etc.  Well, last weekend, I was working on my VW post and musing about how BRK might be related and I had a Eureka moment:

**WHAT IF THEY SWAPPED THE GME/POPCORN SWAP WITH BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY?!?**

Apes and Apettes, allow me to present...Kenny's Master Swap Hedge:  

##**GME / POPCORN / BRK.A**

https://www.tradingview.com/x/2bkGZnhY/

Look at how flat that hedge is everyone. MARVEL at it. It's truly amazing, if it wasn't so fucking evil. So, this is what Kenny has done, shown here, on the chart, for all to see: 

-	Swap 1: SHORT GME / LONG POPCORN

-	Swap 2: LONG SWAP 1 / SHORT BRK

That's it. GME/POPCORN/BRK.A (or BRK.B...the chart looks the same with either ticker).

Now, recall that Warren Buffett quote from the start of this post: 

>	>I would welcome people wanting to short Berkshire. In fact, I'd lend them stock and earn extra income. They're a certain future buyer...

Warren ""Fucking"" Buffett has bailed out Kenny. Or at the very least, been partner to Kenny's swap. Buying and supporting POPCORN does nothing but hurt GME and help Kenny hedge. Run away apes.  

##**BUFFETT LETTERS**

Each year, Warren Buffet writes a letter to Berkshire Hathaway investors. In particular, I'd recommend apes read the letters from 2002, 2008, and the past couple of years. These are the letters that focus most on *derivatives*, of which swaps are one common type. **I highly recommend everyone here read each of these letters and Control+F for the section(s) on ""derivatives"". 

[2002 Letter](https://berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2002pdf.pdf)

[2008 Letter](https://berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2008ltr.pdf)


**SELECTED QUOTES FROM THE 2002 LETTER**

>Charlie [Munger, Buffett's long-time partner at BRK] and I are of one mind in how we feel about derivatives and the trading activities that go with them: We view them as time bombs, both for the parties that deal in them and the economic system. Essentially, these instruments call for money to change hands at some future date, with the amount to be determined by one or more reference items, such as interest rates, stock prices or currency values.

>The range of derivatives contracts is limited only by the imagination of man (or sometimes, so it seems, madmen). Say you want to write a contract speculating on the number of twins to be born in Nebraska in 2020. No problem – at a price, you will easily find an obliging counterparty.

>But the parties to derivatives also have enormous incentives to cheat in accounting for them. Those who trade derivatives are usually paid (in whole or part) on “earnings” calculated by mark-to-market accounting. But often there is no real market (think about our contract involving twins) and “mark-to-model” is utilized. This substitution can bring on large-scale mischief. As a general rule, contracts involving multiple reference items and distant settlement dates increase the opportunities for counterparties to use fanciful assumptions. 

>Large amounts of risk, particularly credit risk, have become concentrated in the hands of relatively few derivatives dealers, who in addition trade extensively with one other. The troubles of one could quickly infect the others. Linkage, when it suddenly surfaces, can trigger serious systemic
problems.

>Indeed, in 1998, the leveraged and derivatives-heavy activities of a single hedge fund, Long-Term
Capital Management, caused the Federal Reserve anxieties so severe that it hastily orchestrated a rescue effort. In later Congressional testimony, Fed officials acknowledged that, had they not intervened, the outstanding trades of LTCM – a firm unknown to the general public and employing only a few hundred people – could well have posed a serious threat to the stability of American markets. In other words, the Fed
acted because its leaders were fearful of what might have happened to other financial institutions had the
LTCM domino toppled. And this affair, though it paralyzed many parts of the fixed-income market for
weeks, was far from a worst-case scenario. 

>One of the derivatives instruments that LTCM used was total-return swaps, contracts that facilitate 100% leverage in various markets, including stocks. For example, Party A to a contract, usually a bank, puts up all of the money for the purchase of a stock while Party B, without putting up any capital, agrees that at a future date it will receive any gain or pay any loss that the bank realizes. Total-return swaps of this type make a joke of margin requirements. Beyond that, other types of derivatives severely curtail the ability of regulators to curb leverage and generally get their arms around the risk profiles of banks, insurers and other financial institutions. Similarly, even experienced investors and analysts encounter major problems in analyzing the financial condition of firms that are heavily involved with derivatives contracts. When Charlie and I finish reading the long footnotes detailing the derivatives activities of major banks, the only thing we understand is that we don’t understand how much risk the institution is
running.

>The derivatives genie is now well out of the bottle, and these instruments will almost certainly multiply in variety and number until some event makes their toxicity clear. Knowledge of how dangerous they are has already permeated the electricity and gas businesses, in which the eruption of major troubles caused the use of derivatives to diminish dramatically. Elsewhere, however, the derivatives business continues to expand unchecked. Central banks and governments have so far found no effective way to control, or even monitor, the risks posed by these contracts. 

>**Derivatives are financial weapons of mass destruction, carrying dangers that, while now latent, are potentially lethal.**

Damn Buffett. ""Financial weapons of mass destruction."" Guess he doesn't ever use the things then eh?  

**Buffet's 2008 Letter to Investors**
 
>Improved “transparency” – a favorite remedy of politicians, commentators and financial regulators for averting future train wrecks – won’t cure the problems that derivatives pose. I know of no reporting mechanism that would come close to describing and measuring the risks in a huge and complex portfolio of derivatives. Auditors can’t audit these contracts, and regulators can’t regulate them. When I read the pages of “disclosure” in 10-Ks of companies that are entangled with these instruments, all I end up knowing is that I don’t know what is going on in their portfolios (and then I 
reach for some aspirin).

>Derivatives contracts, in contrast, often go unsettled for years, or even decades, with counterparties building up huge claims against each other. A frightening web of mutual dependence develops among huge financial institutions. Participants seeking to dodge troubles face the same problem as someone seeking to avoid venereal disease: It’s not just whom you sleep with, but also whom they are sleeping with. Sleeping around, to continue our metaphor, can actually be useful for large derivatives dealers because it assures them government aid if trouble hits. 

##**WARREN BUFFETT TOLD THE GOVERNMENT TO BAIL OUT WALL STREET**

So, I wasn't aware of this, but keep in mind that while BRK was mirroring VW's stock in 2007-2008 (prior to the VW squeeze, see my last post), Buffett was making [THIS LATE NIGHT PHONE CALL to the Secretary of the Treasury](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/11/how-warren-buffett-helped-save-the-economy-during-the-financial-crisis.html). 

Wait. What?  You're telling me that Warren Buffett, called the Sec Treasury late at night while he was asleep, and put the bug in his ear to give the bail out to WALL STREET instead of bailing out the actual underwater homes (i.e. Americans). Do you apes see how manipulative this is?  He didn't have to call him late at night. He *knew* that calling him late at night would mean he's more confused and suggestible, easier to manipulate. And he talked him into doing the exact thing that Wall Street needed: A huge bailout of their insanely underwater derivative positions. 

Warren Buffett just became Montgomery Burns. 

##**FAST FORWARD TO TODAY**

Berkshire Hathaway just released their earnings report. Guess what it shows? A *huge* loss on their derivative positions. Now, as Buffett said, we have zero way of knowing from looking at their books what these positions are, but based on the chart data above, I think we can reasonably conclude that at least one of those positions involves a swap with GME, POPCORN, and BRK. One glaring omission from his letter this year?  No mention of derivatives or the loss in his annual letter. In previous letters he states clearly that he personally takes full responsibility for BRK's derivative positions, and when there are losses there, he usually talks about them. This year, he did not. Curious. 

Anyways, this swap linkage explains many things. It explains why BRK.A volume has increased so dramatically since the Sneeze. It explains why it had the same volume jump with VW in 2008. It explains why BRK is mirroring GME and why POPCORN was pushed so hard on social media and why POPCORN often follows or lags GME movements in weird ways, almost acting as a ""leash"" on GME. I think it also explains BRK's share buy backs and is in line with Buffett's past comments about welcoming people to short BRK.  

##**TLDR**

KENNY (or some large short) may have made a SWAP that was SHORT GME and LONG POPCORN, then combined this with a SECOND SWAP that may be SHORT BRK. This gives the equation: GME/POPCORN/BRK and if you graph this using Tradingview, you get a chart that looks almost totally flat since June...a near-perfect hedge.

##**Edit: DATA

The amazing u/bobsmith808 was kind enough run some numbers for us. At this point, our feeling is that the hard data is…inconclusive. 

https://imgur.com/a/RajOGGO/

It’s clear from the chart and the data that the biggest part of the hedge is POPCORN. It’s clear that however BRK is tied in, it’s a less strong correlation. My problem with the data overall is that I don’t think it’s going to correlate 1:1 like this because we’re essentially correlating 1/POPCORN (which correlates fairly well) but also with some BRK sauce thrown in, so it’s really 1/POPCORN*BRK so it gets more complicated. 

This will remain a work in progress and an area of intense investigation. I am convinced Popcorn is a hedge against GME, and I am convinced BRK is involved somehow, either willingly or unwillingly, but the nature of BRK’s involvement is, at this point, still murky. I strongly suspect, based on my intuition and gut reading of the chart and situation (interviews and such) that they’re taking the other side of Kenny’s swap, but I can’t **prove** it with data yet so consider this speculative for now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/uhs0x1/the_popcorn_buffett_hedge_a_weapon_of_financial/,Digitlnoize,2022-05-04 03:39:00,8551,Superstonk

# 1. Introduction

On **May 3rd, 2024** (Friday) I revealed in the evening that there was a long term chart breakout: \[[Have a Great Weekend. Cheers Everybody! : (r/Superstonk)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1cjjl8j/g_m_e_have_a_great_weekend_cheers_everybody/)\]

On **May 6th, 2024** (Monday) I then publicized in the evening that there were indications that *'MOASS' is now beginning*:

[The 7 investing days after this post saw a 490.50&#37; growth factor in GameStop Corp's share price ](https://preview.redd.it/69g2a2qovt5d1.png?width=703&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba0ee15484d31038fdf9a87a1259b596a4680b70)

On **May 9th, 2024** (Thursday) I then reminded investors that GameStop Corp's [Price is still substantially discounted \[(r/Superstonk)\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1co8aln/g_m_e_price_is_still_substantially_discounted/).  The 3 investing days after this post saw a 444.20% growth factor in GameStop Corp's share price.

On **May 18th, 2024** (Saturday) I wrote that GameStop Corp is a [Green, Cash-and-Criminal-Siphoning, Tornado-Spawning, Category 6 Hurricane of Our Evolving Stock Market : \[(r/Superstonk)\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1cvc2af/g_m_e_the_green_cashandcriminalsiphoning/).  This was and is based on GameStop Corp rapidly raising Billions upon Billions of dollars through offerings during outsized demand phases for the stock.  This writeup continues to be a good explanation of what is happening.

On **May 31st, 2024** (Friday), after the 45 Million share offering gave GameStop Corp another Billion dollars, I wrote that there was [Evidence that 'MOASS' would resume : \[r/Superstonk\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1d549fg/g_m_e_evidence_suggests_that_moass_will_now_resume/).  The following investing day saw 205.27% growth factor in GameStop Corp's share price..

On **June 4th, 2024** (Tuesday), in the evening I provided a brief technical update regarding the status a clear continuation: [MOASS - Update 1 of 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1d8cj2c/g_m_e_moass_update_1_of_3/).  After that post, there was a 254.82% growth factor in GameStop Corp's share price.

GameStop Corp is, as was prophesized, revealing institutional-driven market fraud almost daily now.  This is actively exposing white collar crime on Wall Street, and pretty easily, to the FBI's ongoing securities fraud strike force.  GameStop Corp too is siphoning cash at a pace that has never been seen before.  Now it is estimated that GameStop Corp already has over $4 Billion dollars in cash, yet the share price continues to go up!

# 2. Technicals and Developments

Today revealed ironclad evidence that the psychological number of $25 (*$100 prior to the 4:1 split that was once-supposed to be in the form of a dividend*) is now serving as a strong support.  This number is important, because it serves as either support or resistance.  $25 is now supported.  This means that today saw a 'backtest' off of that support.  Now, it would be reasonably expected \[*technically*\] for the price to bounce up off of it.

https://preview.redd.it/rcfkht737u5d1.png?width=1114&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb11c82c4941c8bd04cddbb82791d46263faf85a

There too are upcoming calendar events that will have an impact the ability to obtain true economic price discovery:

The long term chart shows that the price has clearly begun a substantial, long-term breakout that is showing no signs of slowing down (*below the '$80.00 thus far label' you can see the bottom supported trend is rising substantially*)

[I anticipate that eventually, the $100-$120 price window will serve as a future support](https://preview.redd.it/sf288e2z6u5d1.png?width=736&format=png&auto=webp&s=366f7a36bdd218cd374d294e55c72d1551d37411)

# 3. Macro Market

Citadel *et al* had continued to pump their short-term Artificial-Intelligence scam (*now sounds old, doesn't it?*) play: """"Nvidia"""".  Yet, Nvidia's split today was well-considered to be the 'sell the news' event.  Therefore, and now with the Dept. of Justice beginning [a new DOJ investigation into Nvidia](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/is-doj-inquiry-into-nvidia-a-sign-the-chipmaker-has-peaked), SHF will now begin to have a shrinking equities column.  Remember that to fight against margin pressures \[*rising liabilities columns (i.e. GameStop short bags)*\], SHF needed to pump their equities columns \[*i.e. shitcoins, Bitcoin, and the magnificent 7 promotion scam which includes the Nvidia pump*\].

Bitcoin, and especially the altcoins that SHF attempted to pump using leverage and futures are too losing steam.  [Media outlets are now promoting a worse-than-2008 stock market crash](https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/economist-harry-dent-predicts-stock-market-crash-worse-2008-crisis-bubble-bubbles) that will now occur at any moment.  It appears, then, that SHF is attempting to 'get ahead of the Minsky moment narrative' by *front-falsifying* *the reason* why the market will go down soon.  The same front-falsifying \['''*HoUsInG and MoRtGaGe BaCkEd SeCuRiTiEs'''*\] occurred after the June 2008 \[*negative-beta driven*\] inversion that was caused by naked short sellers' irresponsible bets against Volkswagen in 2008:

[GameStop FTD's from late 2020 to January 2021 stacked similarly to Volkswagen's in 2008.  Not shown in the chart is the next 'FTD train' that overwhelmed naked short sellers who exploit SEC's Reg SHO Rule 204.  35 days to the right of this chart, Volkwagen stock ran up about 1,000&#37;, and the entire stock market went down on negative beta.  This same phenomenon is occurring now again with GameStop, with the next FTD train set to be bought back in mid-June.](https://preview.redd.it/2am07qiseu5d1.png?width=922&format=png&auto=webp&s=29bac599f1817fa5db276f3d89d8ed10094565a0)

[This chart shows that SHF's irresponsible bets too led to a market inversion in 2008, and that the market-wide inversion was more due to this phenomenon than what was widely depicted as a housing-only problem.  Naked Short sellers got caught with overwhelmed FTDs, it caused a $100 Billion+ market shock, and hedge funds then lied about the acute cause of the 2008 crash.](https://preview.redd.it/9h5av871lu5d1.png?width=1023&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c8db5d311a663f2340651f61ff89db59591531f)

Yet, we already knew here in the one and only SuperStonk that the market will only go down on Negative Beta with GameStop Corp.  This will be due to hedge funds and their prime brokers who bet *so-irresponsibly,* using teacher's pensions and Americans' retirement accounts, against household investors and innocent American companies.  Irresponsible Hedge Funds like Citadel (*and especially its market-making arm*) are to blame for the coming mess on Wall Street.  This mess is going to be necessary to better-identify the fraud that these sickos engaged in - and hedge fund managers who made or supported the bad bets should be *thrown in jail* due to their premeditated violations of their fiduciary duties.

It is sad to observe and sad to admit: these hedge fund bad actors and their bought-media puppets have truly surpassed Bernie Madoff in magnitude of historical fraud.

As for me... and remaining unbiased given the above technicals... I just do not see a better place in the world for any investor to park their money right now: amidst a high-inflationary 📈, high-debt 🧨 global environment \[an*d where two conventional warfare fronts 🔫 remain ongoing\]: Ga*m***eStop Corp ha***s negligible/no debt.  Gam**eStop Corp is** n*ow annually-profitable 🙌.  Ga*me***Stop Corp has*** *now decades-worth of cash 💵.  Gam*eStop Corp too is *a fantastic, family-and-kid-friendly inve*stable brand 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦.  GameStop stores 🏪 remain fun to shop and play at, and [GameStop.com](http://GameStop.com) 💻 📱 easily forms a shopping habit because it's so easy to use.  The customer service team is pleasant 📞.  I routinely choose [GameStop.com](http://GameStop.com) ✨over dying sites such as '''Amazon''' ☠.  So, where is the risk with this fascinating company?  Where is it?  When this gross, DTCC-infested market is cleaned up \[*and it will be soon*\], GameStop Corp is clearly #1.  Yet, trends from GameStop Corp's filings suggest that the company may even exit the DTCC-infested market altogether by entering the tokenized stock landscape.  So either way: **GameStop Corp** **wins** across the short term, medium term, and the long term.  I find that **GameStop Corp** is, therefore, a rare **Safe Haven stock that is immune to recessions**.  I do not even need to mention the other realities: that **GameStop Corp** has perhaps the most loyal shareholder base probably in stock market history 🏛.  GameStop Corp investors do not just 'l*ike' the above facts, nor do they simply just 'like'* the stock... Instead, there is a historic bond between shareholders: and there is a historic love for the real company behind which the shares mark personal ownership.

# 4. TLDR

GameStop Corp is anticipated to already have more than $4 Billion cash.  410 Million shares were transacted over the last 2 investing days.  Only 18% of that needed to be the share sale for it to be completed.  There is a high likelihood that offering is near-completed or completed.  Technicals reveal $25 psychological support held today, and a technical-rebound is safely anticipated.

This $4 Billion+ warchest was made even though GameStop Corp's share price is higher than it was when it had $2 Billion cash \[*and then the share price is higher than it was when it had $1 Billion cash, etc*\].  Typically, in ""*DiLuTiOn*,"" one would expect the share price to go down.  That did not happen here: even with this cash raise, GameStop Corp's share price still grew by a factor of 254.27% since the *long-term-higher-low* that was achieved in April.

Further, news from GameStop Corp's CEO, Ryan Cohen, is expected this week during the annual shareholder meeting.  Too there are rumors swirling about possible dividends in the form of digital collectibles, possible acquisitions using free cash, etc.  Yet, the analysis above did not need to consider any of these fundamental developments for the same conclusion to be further-solidified: that **MOASS is still in progress and it is still early.**  Substantial amounts of shares have to be purchased to cover the droves of strikes that are in the money.  There is some gamma impact here week by week, but the most important feature of this, however, are Failures-to-Deliver (FTDs).

FTD delivery deadlines (*i.e. when to buy back and actually deliver the security after it was shorted without a locate*) are 35 calendar days from whence each FTD occurred.  These deadlines lead to 'stacked' time periods \[*what I refer to as FTD trains*\] of what would otherwise appear to be arbitrary buy volume applied to the stock. Compliance with SEC's Regulation SHO began in January 2005: Rule 204 of that is the cheat code that bad actors get *punch-drunk-greedy* off of before their bad bets do put global markets at risk.  Evidence shows that Volkswagen in 2008 saw a similar event that is occurring now with GameStop Corp: Naked Short Sellers had exploited the Rule 204 provision for FTDs *en masse* to support their irresponsible short bets.  It's a cheat code because they freely and flexibly get up to 35 days to buy the stock back - usually at cheaper prices (*i.e. a profit on their FTD'd-short every single time*).  With Volkswagen they became overwhelmed after just one FTD train.  The exact same FTD trains occurred from 2020-2021 with GameStop.  Naked short sellers became overwhelmed from two stacked FTD trains.  FTDs due for settlement/buyback will stack again for GameStop Corp in a few days: due to the FTDs that were generated during GameStop Corp's May price runup.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1dd2zqd/g_m_e_moass_update_2_of_3/,Thump4,2024-06-11 07:04:37,8498,Superstonk
We need to talk about NOK,"&#x200B;

**Feb 4, mid-market:** Thank you everyone for your support. I really don't know what to say. The company keeps getting pounded because GME is having a sell-off, which doesn't make any sense. But that's the market for you. It doesn't always make sense.

I still believe 2021 will be a big year for Nokia, although it doesn't look like there is any way we'll manage the crazy play anymore. Still, it was nice to see something that was impossible become possible, even if it was for only a few days.

And remember, we can still do it any day. All it takes is for us to work together. If you want. Make up your own mind. 

I'm still holding. NOK will recover from this. Fair value is at least 4.81, and way more when 5G really gets going. So if you can, I would buy some more now. You'll thank me later for the tip. It may not be the most exciting play, but it is what investing is all about. Slow and steady growth that compounds to make a big change.

One of these days I'll be able to post again, when the mods lift the restrictions on new posts and things get a little less crazy around here. When I post again about NOK, I'll post the link here too. Thanks everyone!

**Feb 4 premarket:** Earnings out! They beat expectations a bit, their revenue was a little smaller than expected. Overall, good quarter, good year. Here it is: [https://www.nokia.com/system/files/2021-02/nokia\_results\_2020\_q4.pdf](https://www.nokia.com/system/files/2021-02/nokia_results_2020_q4.pdf)

**Feb 2, end of da**y: It's getting pretty crazy out there, but here's what you should know. The NOK chart is following the GME chart. It's got way more shares so the bumps and dips are more stable, but that's the main trend.

**What that means**: GME has no underlying value at this level. It is a gamble on the short squeeze. It might pay off, or it might not. If people panic sell like yesterday, it won't.

NOK is very different. It has underlying value. So if someone dumps it below its target price, the best thing to do is just to buy and wait for the value to go down. Thursday NOK reveals its earnings, and they are likely to be good based on what Ericsson revealed. Ericsson is one of its main competitors and a very similar company currently trading at twice the NOK price.

Feb 1, end of day: Told you it was a value share! Still trading at target, still low risk.

Either dumping has stopped, or normies are piling in because of the results. Either way good news, hope you made some money today!Vol today 190m, still way above average. Normal average 30m before we changed it lol. That means since Wednesday over 2bn shares have changed hands. Hope you got em!

Ericsson (NOK competitor) results suggest NOK will report good numbers this week, NOK upped to BUY on market watch: [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nokia-upped-to-buy-after-ericsson-results-2021-02-01](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nokia-upped-to-buy-after-ericsson-results-2021-02-01)

Unless my math is retarded (which it is cos ahmsodumb), if everyone (7m) on this sub spends $3000 at current price ($4.55) we BUY THE FLOAT. The more they keep dumping, the more shares we get cheap. Think about it.EDIT: buying the ENTIRE float is NOT the point of this play. I know share price goes up when supply is restricted, just read the play. This is just an example of what happens when they dump a value share on millions of retail investors.

&#x200B;

Added new summary (30 Jan), and Q&A.

FIRST OFF: This post is not financial advice or anything except the rant of some idiot retard who is an idiot. I tell you straight up that there is a normal investment side to the NOK play (STILL MEANS RISK, which YOU will have to decide!) and that there is a CRAZY side that is PROBABLY IMPOSSIBLE. If you want to play the crazy play then you’re also a crazy retard idiot just like me.

I don’t know shit, I just look at graphs and go WOW. Do your own due diligence, I am not a financial advisor. Don’t ask me if you should buy, I don’t know, can you afford to? Are you comfortable with the risks? I don’t know these things. You do.

**NOK PLAY:**

Here’s how it works. YOU DECIDE if you want to take part.

1.It’s **not a short squeeze like GME**. Get that out of your head.

2.It’s a **value/momentum** play. The value part is just normal granny&grampa investing. See a good company going cheap, buy and hold. Tell your mom, dad, granny and grampa, cousins, relatives, friends.

3.The **momentum part is the crazy part**, and if it works the share will SKYROCKET as long as YOU DON’T SELL. GME is the biggest short squeeze in history, the NOK play could be the biggest value buy in history.

4. The beauty of it is that **it works because Wall St is dumping NOK irrationally**. That’s why the price is going down (slowly). They think they’re attacking us and slowly winning, but they’re giving us a value share cheap = their money, our pockets. By the time they realize what we did, it will be too late.

5. **Don’t panic, and keep buying the dumps (if you think the company has value)**, and if we hold the line **you could see a miracle.**

3310 HANDS

&#x200B;

**Value Part (crazy part in Q&A):**

The company is healthy, has good financials, it’s a market leader in 5G (it’s main competitors are Huawei and Ericsson, they have about the same market share share of 5G) a lot of potential to be the company that builds 5G for a large part of the world. NOK is currently trading at a standard price for the value it holds. It is not a bubble.

Here’s Nokia’s 5G contracts: [https://www.nokia.com/networks/5g/5g-contracts/](https://www.nokia.com/networks/5g/5g-contracts/)

Here’s Bloomberg shitting bricks that we’ve realized that Nokia is a value bet: [https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-28/gamestop-may-be-a-reddit-wallstreetbets-game-but-nokia-sure-isn-t](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-28/gamestop-may-be-a-reddit-wallstreetbets-game-but-nokia-sure-isn-t)

Nokia also just unveiled new 1tb tech, the thing AFTER 5G. First on the world. They have it, they’re showing the world it works. Here is their press release from Wednesday: [https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/nokia-and-elisa-push-network-boundaries-with-worlds-first-1t-deployment-2021-01-27](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/nokia-and-elisa-push-network-boundaries-with-worlds-first-1t-deployment-2021-01-27)

They are so trusted that NASA got them to build a cell network on the MOON. Literally. If you’re NASA, would you hire your retard uncle Earl to build cell towers on the moon? No, you hire someone who CAN ACTUALLY DO IT. Imagine what it takes to build something really big and complicated on the moon? Now imagine who’s the likely guy who can do it. That’s right, NOKIA. Here they are, going to the moon: [https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/10/19/nokia-selected-by-nasa-to-build-first-ever-cellular-network-on-the-moon/](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/10/19/nokia-selected-by-nasa-to-build-first-ever-cellular-network-on-the-moon/)

If the Huawei 5G war continues, who do you think US and Europe is going to back, especially since NOK already has the next tech, owns a bunch of patents, is from FINLAND that has never tried to take over the world and has a brand that EVERYONE who lived in 2000s remembers?

Here’s a guy who’s been doing the numbers for a while now in case you want to see them: [https://www.reddit.com/user/Jimming/comments/l7f6ua/part\_iv\_option\_chain\_analysis\_on\_nok\_and\_why\_you/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/user/Jimming/comments/l7f6ua/part_iv_option_chain_analysis_on_nok_and_why_you/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) I don’t know him, I don’t know the numbers as well, but looks pretty good to me. Amazing due diligence. But what do I know, I’m an idiot. So is he. So are you. We’re all fucking retards, just ask Wall Street. I poked myself in the same eye twice yesterday. We’re “dumb money”. They have other names for us too.

So, worst case, you just bought into a good company at a fair value. If the crazy play doesn’t work, you just hold on to them and let them become the world leader in 5G. Unlike GME (NOT SAYING SELL!), NOK will not fall 99%. Or if it does, I'M BUYING THAT SHIT because if a HEALTHY COMPANY FALLS 99% you make some CRAZY MONEY on that when it bounces back.

**Q&A**

**Q: You retards were tricked by bots to buying NOK, there’s no short**

A: This just full on doesn’t get what the play is about. IT IS NOT A SHORT SQUEEZE. THIS IS NOT GME RINSE REPEAT. GME IS A DIFFERENT PLAY. NOK IS A VALUE PLAY. How many more ways can I say it? Not sure. How many more do I have to?

**Q: Stop taking attention away from GME you retards**

A: Nobody is saying sell your GME. Nobody is saying that. GME is too expensive for a lot of people, and GME is VERY RISKY and NOK has genuine value behind it. If the NOK play works, those people who couldn’t afford GME can still get on & get rich. If it doesn’t, they most likely still make money on a good company.

**Q: This play is impossible / crazy / it’ll never work / there are too many shares you retards**

A: This is ALMOST true. This play WAS impossible until 1/27/2021. That is why nobody has EVER tried anything like this. But it’s NOT impossible anymore. Look at this graph. Look at it. See that spike? What the fuck is that? I’ll tell you my fellow autistic space boot packin 3310 using NOKSTER.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v473xl00ghe61.png?width=2182&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf5aac455156dbadb919b80afacb5232af0a05b5

That spike was them running out of shares for half an hour. Trade was stopped until they could find more, to avoid an artificial spike in the price.

Proof? Look at the volumes. A small sale (red) causes a small dip. Two small buys cause a MASSIVE SPIKE. They ran out, and had to call their friends to liquidate more shares so the price wouldn’t skyrocket ""artificially"".

But that’s IMPOSSIBLE for NOK. NOK has 5bn shares. Nokia should be much more stable because it has so many shares, having a crazy demand spike is crazy. I saw it, and fell off my chair and since I’m such a retard it took me an hour to get back up.

So it **was** impossible, and that’s why Wall Street won’t see it coming. They think this is their attack and they’re about to break through our ranks, but they’re actually playing right into our hands.

Wendnesday, we moved 1bn shares. Thursday, when nobody could buy, we still moved 500m. Yesterday, we still moved 360m. We’ve moved so much NOK in the past three days, the average volume of the share has MORE THAN DOUBLED in THREE DAYS. The play is not impossible anymore, but Wall St thinks it is, which is how we can use their own strength and mass against them. But the value buy still makes sense WHENEVER you see someone dump a valuable share. Someone sells you a 100$ bill for 90$? Buy it.

They attack? We absorb. They dump, we buy, they run out of shares, we hold. They’re fucked, and they just handed us a bunch of value shares at an undervalue = they just gave us their money. They are just giving it to you. When they realize they can’t buy them back at a lower value, what do you think is going to happen?

**Q: We don’t do value plays, we do short squeezes you retards**

A: Go back to April. Look at u/DeepFuckingValue’s position. **GME was a value play**. It’s only in April that the Short Squeeze became possible. Look it up yourself.

Will a short squeeze also happen with NOK? It’s unlikely. Hedge Fund Assholes have been increasing their shorts in NOK in the last few days, but they won’t go over 100% on 5bn shares because they're not as stupid as me. But it doesn’t have to happen. We just need to buy the dumps. If they short, great. More money for us as long as we don’t let them drive the price down with the dumps.

**Q: Why is NOK not rocketing?**

A: Because Wall Street is dumping, just like I said they would after the Wednesday spike. That’s the whole plan. They dump, we hold the line, buy the dumps and keep the price steady.

The GME short squeeze guys waited for this for UP TO TWO YEARS. I saw it in April. I thought it was crazy. I didn’t jump in back then. If I did, I’d have about as much money as u/DeepFuckingValue. On a value share, you can afford to wait. GME was originally a value play. That’s what I should have realized in April.

SO JUST WAIT AND HOLD (if you believe and idiot like me, which you shouldn't, no need to message me about it). It’s been two days since this play even became possible.

**Q: How do we know it’s working?**

A: Look at the volume of shares traded. Nokia has 5bn shares. In the last three days, nearly 2bn have been traded. The price is still up from last week. That’s how.

This has already been a giant dumping campaign. How come the price hasn’t floored? What happens if we just buy it all up?

What happens if they run out, and then their shorts blow, the price bumps up, CNBC tells the world we broke another short wall, everyone piles on, Wall Street realizes they just gave us their shares at an undervalue and try to buy back, we don’t sell, we have all the shares? The Wednesday spike is what happens, except this time there is no stopping it. If they stop trading again and try to dump some more, you just buy up the dump and keep the spike going. Spike stops being a spike and becomes a floor.

&#x200B;

**Q: Where will this max out and when?**

A: What do you think I’m from the future? I just saw an impossible thing happen on Wednesday, and we need to make it happen again. Look at the graph. Look at it.

Set your targets to $3310, that should do it.

**Q: When should I buy? What should I buy? Should I buy?**

A: Be your own person. Buy when you feel like it, if you feel like it.

**Q: Wall street bots are promoting NOK.**

A: I don’t give a shit. If they are, and we keep buying, they are promoting giving us money.

&#x200B;

Part 2: (29 Jan)

First off, much as I appreciate the love, I can’t play your hand for you. You have to make your own decisions. Do I know where NOK is going to be tomorrow? Nope. Nobody does. All that I have for you is the news from Wednesday that this play is no longer totally impossible:

1. I think the assholes are going to try to dump you out of the market
2. It won’t work if we keep the demand up.
3. The way we keep demand up is we buy, and others will follow us because the company is good.
4. When they realize it won’t work, they’ll need to start buying back in.
5. Then it’ll be too late, cos they dumped their shares on US and we are RETARDS who HOLD. That means that when their shorts start to go bust, the price will jump up (a little bit, not like with GME at first – this is a different play based on the health of the company, not a straight up short squeeze. The short position on NOK is much smaller).
6. When the price jumps up, and the GME guys start cashing out, they need somewhere to put that cash. Some of them pay off student loans, or buy cars or whatever, but the smart ones will go NOK.

How you play it is up to you. I can’t tell you if you should buy, what minute to buy, what app to use and so on. All I can say is I buy the dumps. You need to decide for yourself if you want to do it. You can see the dumps on any app, or even yahoo finance. I buy NOK on NYSE, and I buy straight up shares (so they can’t lend out mine for shorts) but you’re free to do what you want. I’m a retard, you’re a retard, we’re all autistic fucks, we make up our own mind and stick with it.

Secondly, what I said yesterday morning would happen, did happen. And it happened exactly like I said it would. So don’t get scared off, just buy the dumps. And they know that they’ll be fucked if we keep buying the dumps. That’s why they stopped us from buying NOK.

NOK hasn’t bubbled, stopping us from buying NOK was because they know we’re on to them. They know the dumps won’t work if we JUST KEEP BUYING and HOLDING. The play works, they’re scared, we caught them with their pants down, they’re trying to get ahead of us.

OK, so about what happened yesterday with RH and others. I’m so fucking angry about this.

What RH and others did is completely insane. Their argument is “you guys are throwing your money away on a bubble, we’re just protecting you”. Bullshit. I won’t comment on GME, I’ll let u/DeepFuckingValue or one of those guys do that. I’ll just say, that short squeezes happen with hedge funds all the fucking time. Why is trading not stopped for them? They have people’s fucking pensions that they’re playing with.

But for NOK, it’s TOTAL BULLSHIT. Here’s why:

1. NOK HAS NOT BUBBLED. Look at the graph. Look at it. It is still down from 2016. NOK is well within normal variation. Long term, you barely see the spike from a couple of days ago. There is nothing to “protect us” from. They’re protecting themselves.
2. The NOK play is not a straight up short squeeze. The play is HELPED by the shorts that are there, as long as we can keep the demand up and keep the price up against the dumping, but that’s all.
3. NOK is a healthy company, with new and important tech, a great brand, a lot of potential. You want to see why, read the original post. ANYONE who sees a company like that being dumped for NO REASON would buy. So should you. They are only dumping it because they’re trying to fuck up our play.

Ok that’s enough for now. I’ll see you all when I’ve got my space boots on, in my house on the FUCKING MOON, next to a NOKIA Comms tower, or I’ll see you in VALHALLA with my broke ass. If this doesn’t work, then at least you TOOK ON THE MOTHERFUCKERS and EARNED A PLACE at the table with FUCKING ODIN.

UNBREAKABLE 3310!

**ORIGINAL POST (28 Jan):**

I get it, it’s not the play. I’m not saying sell your GME. I’m not a bot or a spy or a wall street asshole. I’m a regular guy who’s got a couple of bucks in his bank account and plays videogames and wants a fucking house to live in like my parents had when they were young. If you don’t agree with me, just say so.

I’m also not a financial advisor, so make up your own minds you autistic fucks.

But, BUT, yesterday we did something they’ve never seen. Yesterday, we made them run out of NOK shares. That’s what that big spike was, and that’s why trading was stopped for 2h. If we keep doing that, it will be the biggest wall street wealth transfer from assholes to retards in history. Because they will keep dumping it until it’s too late.

Impossible, you say. Too many shares, you say. Well listen up. Yesterday, in ONE DAY, we traded, or caused others to trade, 1bn shares of Nokia. That is 1/5 of all the Nokia shares in the world. That’s never happened, *EVER*. Not even when Nokia was the biggest phone company in the world.

3516.16% of average trading volume.

Do you get it? They’ll keep dumping their stock, we keep buying them cheap, and then they won’t be so cheap anymore when they try to buy back in. We can move 1bn shares IN A DAY. ONE DAY. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Why do they stop trading in NYSE? Cos they ran out of shares temporarily and they don’t want “artificial” spikes in the prices. So they made us retards wait a couple of hours while some assholes called some other assholes to unload their shares into the market, and once they had enough, they started again. That’s why that spike went down right after the freeze.

But then we did it again. And they had to stop again. The price just wouldn’t go down. The assholes who’d just unloaded shares were probably back on the phone with the other assholes who’d convinced them.

Everyone is watching us. What we do, millions of normal folks do with us, and every wallstreet asshole does against us.

What did the asshole brigade do? They started shorting NOK. They will continue to do that, because they think we’re retards (they are correct).

But how come the price didn’t go down? It’s got 5bn shares, and everyone whos ever held it was dumping it. How could we ever keep up the demand when there are so many shares out there? How is this going to work?

Because the retard brigade was buying it. There’s 3m of us and counting. If we each put 600 bucks on NOK, we get 100 shares, and that’s 300m shares.

Now imagine what happens if we put 6000 on it. AND. FUCKING. HOLD. And every dip you see, you buy more. AND. FUCKING. HOLD. They'll keep dumping, we keep buying, until they realize the price isn't going down. Then they start buying, we keep holding, the market runs out of NOK. Price skyrockets.

And normies outside were following us. They can see that the stock is still LOW, lower than 2016. This means they don’t think it’s a bubble that’s going to crash on them.

So why do the normies follow us on this, and not on GME? (I’m not saying sell GME).

Because GME has never, ever been anywhere near where it is now. That scares a normal guy who’s just trying to put in some savings for his family. They think this is some Dutch tulip market shit.

Not so with NOK. Even with the spike from yesterday, NOK is still *DOWN* from 2016. Remember 2016? Remember that being a really big year for Nokia? No, me neither. And let’s not even get started on where it has been in the past. Yesterday's spike barely shows on the graph.

You know what is going to be a big year? 2021 and 2022. Why?

What else did NOK say yesterday? Well, they revealed that they have a new kind of 1 terabit data transfer networks shit, what do I know, I’m not a techie. But it IS a new kind of technology that’s going to kick 5Gs ass. And my fellow retards of the most honorable retard brigade – Do you think we’re going to need more data this year than last year?

Remember how Netflix had to downgrade its picture quality in March because the networks couldn’t handle the amount people were streaming? What do you think is going to happen with the company that solves that?

But why would NOK be the company? Well, remember the 5G war with China?

US and Europe can’t buy 5G from China, because then China has our networks. But guess who US and Europe aren’t afraid of? Fucking FINLAND. Finland, the land of NOKIA. So tiny that some people think the whole country is a conspiracy theory and doesn’t really exist. Sorry Finnish people, nobody gives a shit about you. Good thing for you, cos you get to build the 5G network on the moon and shit because nobody is scared that Finland will take over the world.

Want proof? They are literally building one on the FUCKING MOON: [https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/10/19/nokia-selected-by-nasa-to-build-first-ever-cellular-network-on-the-moon/](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/10/19/nokia-selected-by-nasa-to-build-first-ever-cellular-network-on-the-moon/)

And we’re going to send them there. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

But hang on, why is NOK so low in the first place if it’s so great?

Answer: because Microsoft fucked them. That’s right, they sent one of their own assholes to infiltrate the NOK, leak a bunch shit to drive the share price down, and then buy the phone part of the company. These assholes wrecked the company, the Finnish economy, and every middle class shareholder who was just trying to put their kids to college. Imagine everyone who’d be fucked if someone did that to Apple now.

Worked like a charm. Firesale. Business restructuring. Lost their phones. NOK never recovered.

The asshole they sent from Microsoft? Went back to work for Microsoft, and was paid a shit ton of money for what he did. His name is Stephen Elop. Look it up.

So they have tech that nobody else has and a brand that everyone recognizes. But what don’t they have? Money. That’s why they’re building this 1tb magic network thing in tiny fucking possibly fake Finland to show everyone it works.

But if we drive the share price up, do you think that’s going to change?

So FUCK IT. I’m in for every penny, and I am HOLDING. I’ll see you in my house ON the MOON next to a NOKIA Comms tower, or I’ll see you in VALHALLA you BEAUTIFUL RETARDED MOTHERFUCKERS.

TL;DR: NOK is literally going to the moon. Go there with them. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

"Week 4 D/ST Scoring, 2017","This past NFL weekend will be written and talked about at length over the coming weeks, and deservedly so. The American President spoke out against NFL players – most notably Colin Kaepernick, but also Eric Reid, Brandon Marshall, Malcolm Jenkins, Michael Bennett, and others – calling them “sons of bitches” for kneeling in protest of police brutality during the national anthem, and then calling for them to be fired. He said this at a rally in Alabama, speaking about mostly black men to a mostly white audience. The contempt in his voice was palpable, and his implications were clear. Because fantasy football also has a mostly white audience, it is to them that this piece is primarily directed toward.


Protests are often not intended to be convenient or even pleasant for the people whose attention they are trying to get. They are the inevitable result of a person who has reached their breaking point, someone who is so frustrated with the status quo that they have no other option. And in terms of pure inconvenience, Colin Kaepernick’s protest has barely moved the needle. I’m surprised some folks even noticed “politics invading their sport” in between the national anthem, the field-stretching flag waving, and the Department of Defense-sponsored Salute to Service every week. Consider how lucky you are to have even felt that way to begin with.



Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr’s *Letter from a Birmingham Jail* features the following excerpt:


>“I must make two honest confessions to you, my Christian and Jewish brothers. First, I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to ""order"" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: ""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action""; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a ""more convenient season."" Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.”

The full text of Dr. King’s letter [can be found here]( https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html).

Read his words. Read them, then read them again, then read them once more. Read them until you understand every single one of them, until you recognize that he was absolutely, unequivocally, 100% correct. Dr. King’s legacy during the Civil Rights Movement has been whitewashed in the half-century since his death, and his message has been distilled into the few quoted lines from his “I Have a Dream” speech that are taught in public schools. Why? Perhaps it’s just a coincidence, or maybe it is so the average white American feels less culpability when considering the black experience, if they even allow themselves to consider it at all.


Slavery and its tangential evils left an ugly wound in this country. 150 years have passed since the Civil War, yes, but adherents of white supremacy have enjoyed a measure of comfort in the decades since. They have been Senators and Congresspeople, Judges and lawyers, Mayors and city managers, police chiefs and officers, doctors and engineers, even Presidents; in reality, virtually every role in society at some point, in some place, has been filled by some brand of white supremacist. They have had a hand in making the laws, enforcing the laws, and nearly every aspect in between of American life in some way. And then many tens of millions of white Americans, whether consciously or not, have taken advantage of this system. Those of us who benefit from whiteness have been reaping its rewards time and time and time again.


Read Dr. King’s words again. Think over how many times you’ve heard criticism of Colin Kaepernick, telling the world how much they agree with his message but just wish he would protest differently. Think about how many people, rather than addressing the issues he has raised, have shrouded themselves in the American flag and expressed disapproval about him “disgracing the troops.” Short of actual substantive discussions about the issue of law enforcement in communities of color, we are left with arguments over military support and over freedom of speech. Maybe you have been one of those voices yourself. If you have been – please ask yourself if you are the “white moderate” that Dr. King wrote about, and if so, what can be done to change that.



Know, too, that there are many millions who have watched this all unfold without saying a word in support of Kaepernick’s message to their friends or family; without so much as lifting a finger or raising a fist or taking a step forward; without doing a single thing in support of Colin and his message - they too are Dr. King’s “white moderates.”



We can only claim ignorance for so long. At some point, it becomes time for all of us to take a stand, and for most of us that time has long since passed. Go look at photos of the Little Rock Nine from 1957 as we reach the 60th anniversary of integration. Just as (I hope) none of us want to be remembered as the sneering racists who spit on and abused those black teenagers on their way to school, none of us should want to be remembered as the nameless faces in the crowd that watched it all unfold and did nothing to stop it.


The good news is that it is never too late. Listen to the voices of people of color when they share with you their experience. Amplify the voices that you hear and spread their messages to your friends and family. When you hear somebody say “I’m hurting,” don’t make them jump through hoops or prove their pain; ask them “How can I help?” You have immense ability to change the narrative, to do work beyond just retweeting a trending hashtag, to actually help right the wrongs of racial injustice and move us all forward. 


Colin has gotten our attention. What are **you** going to do about it?

Week 3 was a D/ST disaster for almost everybody. You would have literally done better flipping the rankings upside down and using them in reverse. The top scores on the week were a mediocre Bengals defense at Lambeau, the New York Jets, a mediocre Washington defense against the Oakland Raiders, and the New Orleans Saints on the road. Good luck finding a single person who predicted any of that.


Do recall the following quote from last week: “Lots of road games this week. Of 15 games with public lines, 10 of them have a road favorite. My instinct suggests we’ll have a very frustrating week in general with D/ST scoring.” Weird things happen when we find so many road favorites, and this past week was no exception. Just as you should have avoided weighing Week 1 or Week 2 too highly seven days ago, the same applies to Week 3 today. The entire season to date should be taken as a whole, to the best of our abilities.

**Best of luck in Week 4.** I have dedicated my allotted time this week to writing what I did above, and so I do not have time as usual to expand on the rankings before publishing. I will really appreciate reading any thoughtful commentary and thoughtful responses to what I wrote. However, I will also be happy as usual to discuss our D/ST options in the comments, and will edit the OP to include answers to some of the more common/interesting questions that get asked over the next 90 minutes in particular.

* [Which teams I'd add the Jacksonville Jaguars over, and which ones are a little tougher](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/72kuv2/week_4_dst_scoring_2017/dnjiffc/)

* A lot of questions revolved around the Ravens in particular. I think they're still a good defense, still a mediocre offense, and they got exposed on a neutral field last weekend. Nothing more, nothing less. Unfortunately, this opens the door for them to be something significantly less than an every week starter, and there is not much room between ""every week starter"" and ""drop for streaming"" in D/STs in most leagues. So, they're definitely on notice, and anybody who has cold feet can pivot into the Jaguars pretty cleanly this week. I wouldn't do it myself, but I can understand and support anybody who does.

* As for those Jaguars? They're a very good choice this week. The same hesitations that were here last week are still here for me; but we've now seen more good from them than bad, and so we can *start* to give them the benefit of the doubt. What really sells them though is that their matchup this current week is so good. That's why I called them a ""freeroll"" of sorts. You can add them for Week 4 and start them with confidence regardless of if their offense is ready to start clicking or not. Then, based on what happens in Week 4, you can always reevaluate next week and toss them back in the streaming pile, or reup for Week 5. It's a good spot to be in. Though note, Week 5 they are @ Pittsburgh in what is a very bad matchup.

* A lot of questions revolved around the Cardinals as well. I think they're still a great option going forward. They're not an every-week starter that you can feel comfortable with, but they're not quite a streaming option either. I would bet on them finishing in the top 8 of D/ST scores by year's end, which would put them roughly equal with streaming in most years, and without having to pay any waiver transactions. That's not a bad spot to be in by any stretch, and not something that you can expect to improve upon unless something unexpected falls in your lap.

I think that covers most of the more common questions this week, as well as some of the tougher ones. From the bottom of my heart, thank you so much to everybody who has received this week's writeup warmly. It has been really inspiring to read some of the resulting discussions.

"I made $500,000 trading stocks and options in 18 months. These are the 15 things I did that worked best.","I failed a lot while trading before, during, and after succeeding. I haven’t counted it up, but it’s likely I encountered losses in excess of $150,000 from making mistakes that were easily avoided, rash decisions, and not giving myself enough time to test out strategies. Net net, I’m up $500,000, but I was asked to share some of what worked for me over IM quite a bit after my last post and figured I’d lay it for others who may not want to waste money learning the hard way, as I did. 

These are tactics and strategies that worked for me and my situation - someone trying to increase net worth, not increase income - and they may not be suitable for everyone.

**Understand the Trading Environment**

One mistake I made more than a few times was not understanding or paying attention to the trading environment I was in before picking out a strategy. What do I mean? I need to know where things are in the year, in relation to earnings season, and in relation to sector rotations. I need to pay attention to the macroeconomic indicators and I need to watch the VIX.

**Mind the Gap Between Earnings Seasons**. I can’t stress this enough. When earnings are strong and earnings data is coming in, investors watch those like hawks. Good earnings reports bring confidence to the market which yields a rising market. 

In between earnings seasons, there is less data from companies to review and investors pay closer attention to macroeconomic indicators like inflation, 10-year bond yields, and what the Fed is doing. This makes for a much jumpier market that’s more likely to pull back.  It’s also a time when the large asset managers rebalance their portfolios. They manage billions, so this can cause large movements to stocks and indexes as they shift to be overweight in one asset class (e.g. value stocks, energy) and underweight in other asset classes (e.g. growth stocks, technology).

I try not to get caught by these patterns. I anticipate they are coming and invest accordingly. Simply put, I buy the pullback after the rotations have occurred and before earnings seasons begin as a general rule. Of course, I don’t do this if I expect a terrible earnings season. 

**Take Advantage of Sector Rotations**

The sector rotations are pretty predictable if you track the performance of the different sectors over the year. I do this by plotting sector ETFs on a graph and noting when one begins to gain that was flat while others that were up a lot begin to flatten or pull back. Professional investors tend to sell off sectors that have been hot the last quarter or two and replace them with underperforming sectors that represent a better value or opportunity for upside. If I run the P/E ratios for the sector ETFs, I can get a quick sense of the sectors that have had a hot run up over 30 P/E vs other sectors that are more modestly valued. Just keep in mind that certain sectors, like Tech, will always be valued more richly given their growth. So looking at P/E ratios is not apples to apples - it’s just a way to note if historically that sector is at the high end of its own typical valuation range.

Last year’s worst performing sector tends to be one of the best performing sectors the following year. This is because investors prefer to buy low and sell high. I don’t bet against this trend, it’s been around longer than I have and will continue to be around long after I’m dirt. 

Last year you couldn’t give away a barrel of oil. Last week, oil reached $80 a barrel. 

One of my favorite options strategies is to buy long dated calls at the money for sector ETFs that underperformed the previous year. I buy calls with expirations in 6-9 months, knowing that I will sell at my exit point which for me is a 100% gain. Sometimes this happens 6 weeks into the year; other times it takes 9 months. So long as I don’t overpay for the options, it works. I don’t like to pay more than the average price return of the sector. For example, if the sector ETF averages a 10% annual return and the ETF price is $100, I’m not going to buy a call for more than $10. That way, if the sector only moves 5%, I can still make money provided the price increase moves quickly enough.

**Make The VIX Your Friend**

The VIX is an easy way to gauge fear in the marketplace and is a hedge used widely against market pullbacks. If the VIX goes up, the market is worried. If it goes down, the market is getting bullish. If it stays up, everyone is on edge. It’s hard to make good trades in an environment where everyone is on edge and ready to hit the sell button. So be careful buying during times when the VIX is high. On the flip side, if the market has pulled back and the VIX starts to retreat away from its highs, that makes for a good entry point. 

Another interesting phenomenon is when the VIX is higher than normal, there tends to be a selloff the Friday before a long weekend. This happens because investors don’t want to sit through a long weekend that might hold worse news out of fear they will start their Tuesday with losses piling up. I’ve found this is a nice time to get some discounts at the end of the day Friday, or to run some weekly puts on Thursday afternoon before the dips. 

**Selecting Trades & Investments**

**Have an Allocation Plan**

The first thing I recommend is determining, in advance, the amount of money you want to invest longer term vs the amount you want to invest short term vs the amount of money you might actually need to have available for life emergencies. Anything shorter term is higher risk, higher reward. I break my portfolio in the following buckets:

* 25% long-term market investment using equity ETFs that largely track the SPX or do a breakdown between bonds and the market. I use Vanguard funds and a small cap value fund called CALF. I will not touch this money for 15+ years.
* 25% cash. I like to be ready to buy the dips and have enough to spare. This way if a black swan event happens, I not only have money to invest, I have money to live on should things go bad for a while. This philosophy enabled me to buy options when COVID hit in 2020 without worrying if I could continue paying a mortgage for a year without a job. It’s also very useful if I have to roll covered calls to offset taxes and buy back expensive positions. I took this from Buffet FWIW.
* 30% options, mostly in tax advantaged accounts (IRAs). I aim for a 50% annual return overall with this portfolio, though it fluctuates a lot year to year.
* 10% long term blue chips stocks like Visa, Apple, MSFT, etc. I defend these positions when the stocks get overheated by selling calls on them and/or buying puts out of the money that expire after a typical sector rotation would occur. That can generate some additional income or help lessen the sting if the stock falls. 
* 6% long-term bets in a Roth IRA. These are equities I think all have a chance at a 10X return but that will take 5-10 years. It’s a lot of IPOs, small tech companies, and biotechs. I have to stomach pullbacks in this portfolio of 40-50% on the belief that a few of the 30 in here will more than compensate for it. This is a new strategy for me so I’ll let you know in 10 years if it works.
* 3% leveraged hedges.These are puts on my own positions, stocks, or the market at large. Generally I use VIX calls, buy puts, occasionally buy calls on the SPXS, and run strangles on investments (betting both up and down on the same stock using calls and puts).  
* 1% in other things I can’t mention due to the bots in here but they rhyme with tiptoe.

**Use Technologies to Find Ideas**

Unless you want to spend 8 hours a day reading news or are OK getting all your ideas from meme stocks and friends, you need to use tools to help you locate investment/trade ideas and be willing to pay for them. I value my time and am willing to pay .5% of my portfolio a year if it saves me time, and more if it generates higher returns. 

I’ve tried about a dozen or so services, including stock picking services like Fool and Investorsplace. Ultimately I decided the stock picking sites were not working for me because I did not want to wait 5 years to find out if they were the right recommendations and lost a lot of money learning that lesson on their pump and dumps. So I switched to analytics tools and my Fidelity platform. 

My favorite tools to use are Zack’s VGM score, Levelfields, and Fidelity. The Zack’s VGM measures a stock’s value, growth rate, and momentum. It’s an easy screen I can run off the basic level subscription to get a list of companies to look at. The caveat is that you need to run this screen often because sometimes the companies on the list get stale and have already moved 99% of the way they are going to move. So you need to keep an eye on what’s new to the list to avoid losing money. That part is crucial. 

The list usually represents companies that are well valued and poised to move up over the next 6-9 months. Warning: they can move very slowly so be patient and set your target exit to automatically exit. I use Fidelity to do my own due diligence on the stocks from there, examining their actual growth and earnings rates and ensuring there is no negative news against them which could drive down the price.

A friend recently turned me on to an AI tool called Levelfields. They have a lot of news alerts but only for the types of events that matter and are organized thematically. It helps me find trades on news events with high returns or get in early on the small to mid-cap companies you don’t usually hear about which fall between the cracks in the penny stock discussions and cnbc favorites. They often send alerts on company events before there’s any news out, which is really helpful. The interface shows you how stocks perform when these events happen, so it’s easy to figure out my entry and exit points and statistical likelihood of success.   
I use it a lot for pinpointing entry/exit points from options trades and have bought stock in a few companies I hadn’t ever heard of before that were absolutely crushing it on revenue and earnings. Not sure why, but they never came up in any of my Fidelity stock screens. I suspect it’s because there’s a lag in the data Fidelity is getting from S&P but haven’t confirmed this. They send a lot of high quality alerts and my only wish is that they’d have a better way to rank the stocks in the alerts so I didn’t have to look up the stocks on Fidelity.

I use Fidelity for basic news reading, running stock screens for high growth stocks at decent valuations, looking deeply at the history of earnings results, actually trading options, and for their options scanner which tracks abnormal option activity.  I sell puts when I see abnormal call volume and run strangles if the stock is at a mid-point in its 52-week price range in case it shoots up and then down. I always set an automated exit.

Fidelity also has a cool probability calculator for options I use when selling puts. It tells you the probability of a stock falling below a certain range. I use that number to determine where to sell puts without a lot of risk. I do two standard deviations out and still buy a put with a lower strike price as insurance and sell weekly puts on high vol companies like GME and TSLA. My typical goal is to make 800 a week from these plays which I use to fund new call positions.

**Be Wary of Analyst Opinions**

If you’ve invested actively for a while, you’ve likely noticed a peculiar trend: as a stock is cratering, analysts are increasing their target purchase price on it. This is not for your benefit. Brokerages often make investment recommendations based on the research provided by their analysts, so there is inherent bias in the system. 

I’ve also found that few analysts recommend sell ratings. They are much more likely to issue calls to buy stocks. One study found less than 1% issued sell recommendations. What’s more, the track records of these analysts are usually about the same as coin flipping. CNBC has gotten very into pushing analyst views from big name firms (e.g. “Goldman Sachs says these 3 stocks are ready to explode”), but if you look at the actual analyst behind the headline, they are often inexperienced or wrong more than right. 

I am embarrassed to say I lost a lot of money listening to analyst opinions and believing their price targets were rooted in reality. It’s easy to get caught up in the excitement of an upgrade and if 4 analysts are all touting the stock at the same time it can create a bit of a ponzi effect, which is tradable. But it boils down to needing to do your own research.

**Good Things Come in Pairs**

Just about every stock has a peer or competitor. Most have several. I stopped trying to pick the winner and now place bets on multiple leaders. I’ve owned Visa and Mastercard. I own OLO and TOST. I have a handful of, um, herbal medicine providers. I like ETSY and AMZN. If you bet on a small group of competitors, it’s likely one will pull ahead and your odds of success will increase substantially. 

Similarly, it enables you to monitor the news of competitors which many investors use as a proxy. What do I mean? If Mastercard reports low cross border transactions, it’s highly probable Visa will be experiencing the same thing. So you can use the information from Mastercard to alter your position on Visa.

**Exercise Financial Discipline**

Even when I’ve been successful picking investments, I’ve run into problems with how to handle my successes. We’ve all experienced the thrill of being up huge and wondering how much higher it will go. That’s usually the moment I’ve learned I should be taking some gains. A few rules I try hard to follow but still screw up:

1. Take Profits Often.   
When an option or stock hits 100% return, I look to take some profit. It may not seem possible if you only bought 1 call, but it is. Just roll the call to a higher strike price and ensure the credit to your account equals your original investment plus substantial return. You can let the new call ride in case the stock gets going up. This ensures you cannot lose money. My rationale here is simple: at a 100% gain, I now have more to lose than I have to gain. You will be surprised how much this adds up when you trade often and how often you can be up 150% then down to -50% on the same positions, which makes me want to break things.  
If you find yourself up huge on an equity investment, switch to options. I did this for my BABA position and it saved me. When it hit 300, I was up 200%. I sold all the stock and bought options for the same number of shares. I had about 60K in stock and switched to something like 6K in options. When BABA crashed down to 150 I really didn’t care much. I was only down 4.5K instead of 30K. I had my profit of 40K locked in, so being down 4.5K was no big deal.  

2. Fail Fast.   
If the option price sinks to -50% in value, it’s likely time to call it quits unless you have a solid reason not to (praying is not a strategy). The other half of the value left can easily be eaten up by the time decay in the value of the option as I wait for the turnaround and it gets closer to the expiration date. If there’s negative news driving this, I’m out. I want to fail quickly. That allows me time to take the remaining 50% and generate gains with it on a better investment. I think this is the hardest rule for me to stick to as I tend to be an optimist.  

3. Profit Both Ways.   
If a stock I hold hits an all-time high in price or valuation, I look for a way to profit from the downside by selling covered calls or buying cheap puts. This enables you to stash some cash while riding the volatility wave. I hold Visa and when it hit 235 headed into earnings, I sold 3 calls and bought 10 puts. This offset a paper loss for me of \~20K yesterday alone by 7.5K in gains, which I secured as real profits. Assuming Visa will recover, that 7K adds 9% to this year’s returns for Visa.  

4. Be Patient but Not Greedy.   
I have learned the hard way from selling positions days before they pop that it can take a while before the market catches on to my investment idea, especially if using good tools. Asset managers, wealth managers, and passive investors are usually looking for new investments every 3 months, not daily, so stocks can stay stuck in a channel for some time before the world catches on to its awesomeness. Example, I held Upstart from April to August this year and sold it because it was running flat. A couple weeks later the stock tripled. FML were the only words I could think of at the time. The second thought I had was that I should’ve bought just one call option to replace the stock I sold.  
On the flip side, once a stock does move a lot higher, don’t be greedy. What goes up fast can come down just as fast. I feel a lot worse watching a stock/option go up 200% then come down all the way or more than I do exiting with a 100% gain watching the stock go up more. Don’t chase the perfect trade. It’s a white whale. Just make money.  

5. Everyone Has a Plan Until You Get Punched in the Mouth.   
This is as true in boxing (thanks Mike) as it is investing. That’s why it’s essential to have a plan A and a plan B should plan A not work out as you thought. Waiting through it can work, but it isn’t a very effective strategy for navigating a changing environment.   
So if my thesis is that the stock will do well with rising COVID rates and COVID rates stop rising, I try to have plan B ready. I keep a lot of notes. I track every trade. I review what went wrong with trades quarterly. I learn. I avoid the pity party as much as possible and drink vodka for the rest. I try not to fall in love with any stock. And I know that even if I lose 100K, there’s more money to be made in the coming years and decades if I stick it out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qi92fg/i_made_500000_trading_stocks_and_options_in_18/,Swingtrader79,2021-10-29 14:39:43,7956,stocks
"[Deep DD] new data shows that SHFs lost their last stand with the Feb price drop because apes took over trading GME and now hold, maybe, 100 million MORE shares since Jan. (The price is wrong, just buy and hold, and hedgies are fuk.)","**§0. PREAMBLE**

**TL;DR** This is the whole ball game, right [here](https://imgur.com/a/d13C6Vf) – this should have your tits totally jacked because that trend going up is apes buying and holding. Using odd lot data from the NYSE TAQ you can see how retail investors overran GME. At the end of last year about 37% of trades were small retail orders in odd lots (under 100 shares), now an average of around 87% of GME trades are odd lots. I claim that this is driven by the general lack of liquidity and the fact that apes just keep buying more and more GME. Apes are the ones making most of the moves in GME and when you tabulate the net total increase in shares, apes could easily have bought (and held) 100 million *more* shares since Jan.

**TA;DR** Normal apes can’t afford to buy big barrels of bananas, so to see how much apes are buying we should count up the numbers buying small bunches of bananas. Since January the number of small bunches being traded has gone into the treetops. After estimating how many apes are trying to buy bananas rather than sell bananas, it seems that apes have accumulated maybe 100 million bananas since January.

**Disclaimer** I am not a financial advisor and you shouldn’t read anything in this text as investing advice. I’ve got a PhD, so I have a few wrinkles. But beyond a few intro to statistics classes in grad school, my brain’s pretty smooth when it comes to analyzing stock market data. So please read this (if you can read) as a good faith effort to understand what’s going on with GameStop. I hope you apes can find holes in the argument where I’m wrong, and build on this if I’m right.

**§1. PREMISES**

***Premise 1)*** Retail tends to buy and sell in odd lots (i.e. orders of under 100 shares); institutions tend to buy in round or mixed lots (i.e. orders of 100 shares or more).

You have likely seen stories like [this one]( https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/13/why-retail-investors-are-here-to-stay.html), or [this one]( https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-growth-of-the-retail-investor-revolution-2021-03-10), describing the growth of retail investors in recent years. A [Schwab analysis](https://www.aboutschwab.com/generation-investor-study-2021) concluded that 15% of stock market investors began in 2020.  And [the FT notes]( https://www.ft.com/content/7a91e3ea-b9ec-4611-9a03-a8dd3b8bddb5) that retail trading accounts for almost as much volume as mutual funds and hedge funds combined. Take a look at yourself – *nosce teipsum* – when did you start investing? I bet most of you only began recently, and as a *SuperStonk* member you’re probably more informed and engaged investors than the average.

Hedge funds receive billions of dollars from “accredited investors” who have to have a net worth over $1 million [(17 CFR § 230.501(a)(5))]( https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/230.501). These hedge funds aren’t even allowed to advertise themselves to average investors [(17 CFR § 230.502(c))]( https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/230.502). They then use leverage to multiply that amount they can invest to the point that they have [billions of assets under management]( https://hedgelists.com/top-100-us-hedge-funds-2021/). Accordingly, these investment banks and hedge funds don’t have to nickel and dime; they can afford to buy lots of shares in companies, and usually in orders of 100 shares at a time, or more. These are round-lot orders. 

By contrast, individual retail investors don’t have millions of dollars to throw around. They can’t buy 100 shares here and 200 shares there. After all, 100 TSLA would set you back almost $70,000, and that’s after a recent stock split! Heck, even if a stock costs $10, you’d have to drop a grand to get to a round lot order. I don’t have that kind of money lying around on the regular. So, we buy in odd lots: 2 shares at a time, 10 shares, and almost always under 100 shares.

When you put these two phenomena together – that retail comprise an increasing proportion of all trades and that retail tends to buy in odd lots – you get [this phenomenon](https://imgur.com/a/OongaQz) outlined by the SEC [(source)](https://www.sec.gov/marketstructure/datavis/ma_stocks_oddlotvolume.html). The rate of odd lot trades is rising consistently (especially among more expensive stocks – think TSLA) and the exchanges and data aggregators are scrambling to capture this new development. For example, the SIP only began reporting odd lot trades in 2013 [see readme file from NYSE TAQ]( https://easyupload.io/temeaz) and the [Consolidated Tape Association](https://www.ctaplan.com/oddlots) is trying to figure out how best to relay this new data stream to users.


***Premise 2)*** Retail tends to buy and hold GME (especially after the Jan Sneeze).

This is a qualitative assessment. I’m sure that some people are day trading GME, and members of this sub sometimes give anecdotes of their friends who sold out already. I would also wager that some of the January FOMO crowd have sold. But this analysis is primarily concerned with the months *since January* and I’m going to assume that most people buying GME since Jan have a fairly high risk tolerance and aren’t a bunch of [paperhanded Portnoy bitches](https://twitter.com/Mediaite/status/1408151781926969346?s=20). Moreover, if you’re buying GME in 2021 at a price of over $100 while the media is hammering you with “forget GameStop” articles then you’re a special kind of ape. You’re super bullish on the fundamentals of GME, which means you’re holding. Or you are familiar with the DD (or trust someone who is) and believe that a squeeze is likely, which means you’re not selling for a mere 50%-100% profit. Or, you’re like me, and you’re a combination of the two, and you can be damn sure I’m not selling any time soon.

***Premise 3)*** Retail tends not to short GME.

To some degree this is a corollary of premise 2; if retail buys and holds, then retail isn’t selling short. But we can be a little more precise here. Footnote 1 on p. 803 of this article by Eric Kelley and Paul Tetlock in *The Review of Financial Studies* [(2017)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26166324) invokes NYSE data showing that only 2% of short sale orders are from retail. It should be noted that this doesn’t account for retail orders that are internalized or filled through dark pools, and the number of retail investors has grown considerably since 2017. Eyeballing the odd lot volume data from above, odd lot trades in the middle decile by market cap has risen from between 8-10% in 2017 to 11-15% in 2021. Let’s be conservative and say that since 2017 retail has doubled, and so if they keep shorting at the same rate as in 2017, retail maybe makes up 4% of shorts on the NYSE. If you add dark pools and internalization that might push the number up to – let’s be conservative again – say 10%. When you add in the fact that there is a shared aversion to shorting GME among retail investors expecting a squeeze, any reasonable estimate must put the % of retail shorting GME as a fraction of the total trading it.

**§2. DATA**

I have been analyzing intraday [TAQ data from NYSE](https://www.nyse.com/market-data/historical/daily-taq), which compiles trades, quotes, the NBBO and the like for just about all US exchanges. I get access to this data through my university, so I imagine it will not be accessible to most readers. So, I’ve uploaded a copy of the [raw .CSV data file](https://easyupload.io/8s3guu) I’ve been using for my analysis. Now anyone can peer review and hopefully improve upon or refute my assessments.

[Here](https://easyupload.io/6do1th) is a link to the very messy .xlsx file I have been using to play with the data above. It’s crude and as modeling is not my area of expertise, I worry that I may have made some elementary mistakes. I hope someone with patience will give it a look and correct any errors in my data use and/or my conclusions from the data.

I also make use of the short volume data compiled by the formidable [AnnihilationGods_Data_Project](https://twitter.com/Annihil4tionGod). I had been using fintel.io data to ascertain short volume, but [*The Daily Stonk 06-08-2021*](https://github.com/verymeticulous/wikAPEdia/blob/b5ce62daff2969556ee76f2951b9f4eb92afebca/Daily-News/Daily-Stonk-Archives/06-June/2021-06-08-Synopsis.md#the-daily-stonk-06-08-2021) relayed the inaccuracies in the fintel.io data as explained by Annihil4tionGod. They have been maintaining the data file since then and you can access the master file [here](https://twitter.com/Annihil4tionGod/status/1425445775929184265?s=20).

Note: I have been using easyupload.io to make data files available to download. However, their hosting expires after 30 days. I hope that someone more knowledgeable than me can backup or create mirrors of this info if it proves useful.

**§3. ANALYSIS**

*(a) Basic Volume Changes:* [Here’s](https://imgur.com/a/OFOcwAJ) the chart of GME’s price that you’re all familiar with. (I love that slight up turn over the last few days!) And [here’s](https://imgur.com/a/I7isUbp) the rise in odd lot trades over that same time period. Notice the huge spikes in odd lot volume with the Jan Sneeze and the first $350 price spike in March. Of course, these were periods in which the overall volume increased dramatically, so the reason that you’re seeing more odd lot trades is because there are more trades *simpliciter*. You can see the similarities between the increase in odd lot trades and the increase in all trades as both have a similar shape [when plotted out](https://imgur.com/a/QwtEVJZ). ^Footnote ^1. 

Even so, it’s notable that the most recent run to $350 at the end of May/start of June doesn’t see nearly the same increase in retail trades as the previous run-ups. *Prima fascia* this suggests that something different is happening from May onwards compared to Jan-March. My initial thought is that this is evidence of the [March to Zero Liquidity](https://github.com/verymeticulous/wikAPEdia/blob/13fa1f654be676e295894cd2121fa6a554f5b3d1/Due-Diligence/2021-05-02-The-March-to-Zero-Liquidity.md) as large price swings are occurring without the order of magnitude increases in retail volume that we saw before May.

Additionally, note the asymmetry between the left and right of the total volume vs odd lot volume [charts]( https://imgur.com/a/0qlwg9c). In August and October last year there were some spikes in total volume, but no appreciable increases in the level of odd lot buys. (I wonder if the August bump is from Ryan Cohen.) After the January spike, though, every increase in total volume is matched with a comparable increase in odd lot orders. 

Of course, this might just be explained by the increase in the price of the stock. Last year DFV and others could buy GME by the thousands because it was trading in the single digits. Since Jan the stock has mostly stayed above $100 and never dropped below two digits. So, it makes sense that there would be a relationship between price and odd lot volume. But I'm not convinced that the price increase is the only factor. Here’s [popcorn stock](https://imgur.com/a/6Ubuy0V) by comparison. Note the big jump in odd lot trades in January, even when the price is only $10-15. GME was trading around that price in October 2020 and there doesn’t seem to be a big jump in odd lot buys in GME at that time, so it’s not clear (to me at least) that prohibitive cost is driving the rise in odd lot trades.

*(b) Order Size and Odd Lot Rate:* [This](https://imgur.com/a/BC0UpcN) is where things get really interesting. Last August the average round lot order was between 275 shares and 375 shares. By contrast, round lot orders today are around 160-180 shares. This shows us two things. 

* First, there has been a steady decline in the average order size by institutions; they’re buying (and shorting) smaller amounts each time. 

* Second, the variance between the average high and the average low order size was much greater a year ago than today. 

In my judgment, this reflects the general decline in liquidity. As fewer shares are available, it’s not possible to sell 200+ shares at a time. I suspect that this reflects a lack of autonomy on the part of institutions. Last year some swashbuckling SHFs could sell big chunks of GME in one go. Think, for example, of the married-put chicanery with MMs that would allow the SHFs to sell phantom shares. As these SHFs didn’t have to locate these shares before shorting them, order size wasn’t an issue. But things have changed since January, not least that there have been considerable rule changes by the DTCC, OCC, and NSCC. I speculate that more and more SHFs have to actually locate the shares before they short them, which is hard to do. So now all SHFs are all being constrained by supply and demand in similar ways, which is why they cluster around a much smaller order size.

We see a similar decline in odd lot order sizes over the past year: [chart](https://imgur.com/a/ht07Hjg). But you’ll note that there is a more precipitous decline in order size as the price increases, which makes sense if retail is more price sensitive than wealthier hedge funds. We were consistently buying more shares at a time when the price was lower, so that demonstrates that price matters. But we haven’t been deterred by the high price. We’re still buying, just in smaller amounts.

**This difference in order size is important because we can use it to see who is in control of the stock. We can use total average order size (so the average order size for both odd lot and round lot orders combined) as a proxy to see who is hustling the most and buying/selling more shares: retail or institutions?**

* If the total average order size is a round lot order, then institutions are in control. The shorts are running the show as they’re able to sell big orders into the open market.

* By contrast, if the total average order size a small odd lot order, then that means that retail are the ones who are making the moves. Retail is buying up shares here and there and they’re not stopping. 

**And the data says that [retail is absolutely in control](https://imgur.com/a/RcJYv1n).** 

Last year the average order size basically corresponded with the average round lot order size. Sure, retail dragged the order size down slightly to 200-275 shares a time, not the full 250-350 in odd lot orders alone. But trades were big – large numbers of shares being moved at a time. And there was high variance, with a spread of around 75 shares between the highest and lowest average. 

Everything changed after January, though. The precipitous drop in order size we saw in the odd lot order size is clear as day in the total average order size – so retail really had an effect on the order size. We pulled it down hard in January. And the average size hasn’t regressed up to the mean before January. After the average order size was pulled down, it stayed down. Moreover, the variance in the order size diminished, too; only, say 10 shares difference between the highs and the lows. 

So what explains this change in average order size? I think there are two things at play.

* First, and probably to a lesser extent, SHFs are having a harder time locating shares because of rule changes and because apes buy and hold. As SHFs can’t locate the shares, they can’t buy them or sell them in big blocks. So now apes and SHFs are playing on the same pitch: we’re both constrained by supply and demand. SHFs can’t magic up millions of shares and sell them off in big orders, and apes can’t buy big orders either. Apes are hodling like champions so there simply aren’t enough shares to trade them in big orders. 

* Second, there are just so many damn apes out there. After apes piled in with their odd lot orders, they didn’t leave. No matter how many MarketWatch articles or Jim Cramer interviews told us to “forget GameStop,” we just can’t quit it. Apes kept buying. *Price goes up, we buy a handful of shares. Price stays the same, 5 shares more. Tasty dip? Thanks, Ken, I’ll take two.*

**And the proof that apes aren’t going anywhere is in the data. [Look at this.](https://imgur.com/a/d13C6Vf) This will be my first NFT after MOASS because it’s just so beautiful. 80-90% of all trades are regularly odd lot trades. That’s us.** We’re the ones buying in these odd lots. Several people on this sub have compared this GameStop saga to a horror movie for the SHFs. We’re like zombies that keep coming and keep coming. They short it and we lap it up. The price rises and we lap it up. This chart is that movie condensed into 1 image. The SHFs must be terrified of us as we're scrambling to get another bite out of our beloved GME while they try to stop us.

Just [look](https://imgur.com/a/UtA0QAV) at what happened when SHFs made their last stand. They tried to take control again and increased their round lot orders to about 30% of the total for the day. That was when they pushed the price down into the $40s. But it was clearly unsustainable. Either too many apes kept buying in or they just couldn’t get the shares to keep shorting. But as soon as they took their feet of the gas, apes just lapped it up again. Now these SHFs are just dead men walking -- they're the zombis. Apes are simply out buying them so their hole gets deeper every day.

Some on this sub may be looking for a whale to blast us off into space, or an NFT dividend as the catalyst that begins the MOASS. But this data shows that apes really are the fuel behind this rocket. Because we’ve each come to see the value of the company through conversations with each other or through our own research, we’re buying in and we’re not stopping. If this carries on, I’m convinced that we won’t even need a catalyst. The march to zero liquidity from apes buying will be enough.

*(c) Buying vs Selling:* In the narrative above it may seem like I’m assuming that all odd lot orders are buys (and holds). And that is a premise of my argument (see §1) as it’s credible to believe both that retail constitute most odd lot orders, and that since January retail tends to buy and hold. But we don’t have to rely upon reasonable inferences as the data gives phenomenal insight into the shifting trading patterns from before to after the January Sneeze.

[GME Orders Before and After Jan Sneeze.]( https://imgur.com/QL3ajz8)

The TAQ database uses the Lee-Ready algorithm to designate whether a trade is initiated by a buyer or initiated by a seller. I am going to assume that retail apes are not buying or selling any round orders – maybe they’re just institutions rebalancing with the ETF changes. So instead, let’s focus on where apes may be buying and (yuck) selling.

On the highest extreme model, assume that the all odd lot buyers are apes and that they diamond handed everything. That means apes would have 831,099,331 more shares now than before the Sneeze. 

On the lowest extreme model, where apes bought all the odd lots and paper handed everything, they would have a net increase of 45,591,791 shares.

These two numbers give us a sense of where the outer limits are. Let’s add two further variables to make this model more credible:

* First, let’s not forget that there’s been a lot of shorting going on. Approximately 434 million shares have been sold short. Let’s be generous and assume that all of these shorts are with borrowed shares, so there are no new naked shorts. And let’s assume that if they close their position, the shorts always buy back their shares in odd lots.

* Second, although apes buy and hold, some retail purchases in odd lots will be by people less familiar with the details around GameStop. This subset of people may have bought, but also sold some of their shares over the last few months. 

Putting these two together you get a: [Range of Retail’s GME Ownership Since Jan Squeeze](https://imgur.com/a/XClwoHT)

Let’s break this down. First assume that no shorts have covered (so all the odd lot buys are real buys, not covering). If apes/retail bought 80% of those odd lot buys and didn’t sell much of them back (only 20% of those shares) then apes may have added 500 million shares to their portfolios. On the other side, if retail is a bunch of broke paperhanded Portnoys, we’d only have 33 million shares after buying 20% of the available shares and selling 80% of those back again.

Is 80% buying by retail an excessive estimate? Quite possibly. But recall the [the FT reporting](https://www.ft.com/content/7a91e3ea-b9ec-4611-9a03-a8dd3b8bddb5), that retail makes up the same volume of trades as hedge funds and mutual funds. Moreover, we shouldn’t neglect the fact that few other stocks engender the same excitement as GME. Consequently, it wouldn’t surprise me if apes are buying well over half of the available shares. We’re just gobbling up what we can.

But, the number of shares available for apes to buy drops once shorts cover. If we assume that half of the odd lot buys went to close out short positions, then the range of ape ownership increase drops from about 400 million to 25 million. If all shorts were closed out of the odd lot buys, then the number of available shares for apes to buy drops further. If they bought 80% of those remaining shares, then the net increase in apes’ positions could be as high as 250 million. On the lower end, if apes didn’t buy much and sold most of it back, the increase could be as little as 16 million shares of GME.

**§4. CONCLUSION**

Odd lot trades can act as a proxy for retail investors: the more odd lot trades, the more retail investors trading a stock. When we look at GME, the number of odd lot trades has risen dramatically to an average of around 87% of all trades (up from about 37% at the end of last year). 

Three explanations for this growth were presented: rising prices; decreasing liquidity; persistent buying by apes. In my estimation the latter two are the primary drivers here. There simply aren’t many shares available to buy (numerator) and Apes just keep on buying [(denominator)](https://imgur.com/a/a2FuvKD) so the average trade size has dropped precipitously.

As the average order size is so low now and odd lots make up so many of the total orders, it’s likely that institutions are reduced to odd lot trades, too. This reflects the weak trading position of SHFs as they cannot move the market with big sells like they used to. It also reflects the strength of apes: we just keep buying and buying – we’re running this show now.

By disaggregating buyers from sellers (using the Lee-Ready method), we saw how many of these small odd lot orders were initiated by buyers. Apes buy and hold and retail tends not to short sell. So, how much did apes increase their GME holdings by? We modeled a range of possibilities depending on some variations in covering and possible ratios of retail buys to sells in odd lots. 

**The main take away is that, even on a highly conservative estimate where all shorts since the January Sneeze closed their positions using odd lot purchases, and where retail buys only half of the available shares and day trades half of those back again (yuck), the net increase for apes is about 100 million shares.**

Footnote 1: A regression model of total volume against odd lot volume suggests that about 65% of the increase in odd lot volume is caused by the increase in volume *tout court* (r-square: 0.641). But the standard error seems quite large and one of the p-values is below statistical significance, so I’m not sure that this is a useful measure. I’m not a statistician, so I expect that I’ve bungled something somewhere, which is why I’ve put this as a footnote.

We are the point where the FED literally can't pump this market up anymore... I mean they would need crazy stimulus to the tune of trillions...

**Markets have gotten to the point where the new money the FED pumps in for liquidity isn't working, which is alarming since their only tool is to print more...**

Pretty bad huh.. but it gets much worse...

The FED balance sheet is composed of BONDS... mostly treasuries and agencies...

A YTD look on Treasuries...

**The longer bonds are selling off more than the intermediary and shorter as you'd expect...**

So how many 20 year bonds does the FED have on their balance sheet?

[From March 10th... It shows the FED has almost $5.75 Trillion in Treasuries... and more than $1.2 Trillion in the 20 year bond... ](https://preview.redd.it/wwjwtjfte6n81.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef6f45691ccb9a574e9c183cc80154c461ebc6bb)

YIKES... SIDE NOTE...

[The FED has $2.25 Trillion in circulation and $1.75 in RRP and $250BN in overseas accounts??? ](https://preview.redd.it/tai93wj6f6n81.png?width=783&format=png&auto=webp&s=e825f242ac4eec9128ff704e5252b411e8ea7d95)

So inflation is much higher if that RRP money was actually in circulation.

The information above does not paint a good position for anyone to be in. The FED is still spending, and the markets are dropping... its one of the worst starts to a year ever...

**BUT it gets so much better...**

**Theory: FED's portfolios is decaying at a rate faster than the money they are pumping in to it.**

Let me explain... I showed you above that the FED Balance sheet has increased YTD... But are their Treasuries not getting wrecked? You bet they are...

With almost $6 Trillion in Securities, the FED owns more than 1 trilllion in 20 year bonds. Well the 20 year bond is down almost 8% YTD. So although it appears the FED balance sheet has increased only $150bn... thats after you factor in the losses.

The FED is spending a lot more than it appears, because the bonds they own are selling off.

Even tho the FED balance sheet is up $150bn YTD... I expect losses of more than $100bn on their 20 year bond exposure... and the selling has just started...

[The 20 year bond looks similar to stonks, more volatile but you can see the trend change earlier in 2021... the market was worried about Treasuries before Stonks...  ](https://preview.redd.it/s36rv40gg6n81.png?width=1669&format=png&auto=webp&s=5cd2e4ed7f1585ea9a24c8d7de8ece3df6320184)

**Other bullets to remember -**

1. When the FED does start offloading their balance sheet? Who is going to buy this? They have $9 Trillion... and yields are sub 2% in a high inflation and possible hyper inflation scenarios.
2. The FED balance sheet is getting rocked by interest rate risk and rising rates. If you look at their balance sheet its hard to see this (it just looks up) - securities going down in value/FED new money coming in -

**Transparency is dying on their website... want some data...**

**TLDR: A YTD analysis of the FED spending and Balance Sheet confirms the DD.**

**The FED holds more Treasuries and Agencies than anyone. Those markets are starting to fall. This will effect the FED balance sheet. When the FED starts to sell these assets... their balance sheet could destroy itself.**

Nobody is coming to my best friend's wedding,"My best friend Melissa is getting married, and of the 100 people she invited, I'm the only one who's going. The other 99? Total crickets. Not one single yes OR no after the invites went out. At first we thought they might have gotten lost in the mail or she used the wrong stamps. But when she texted everyone to ask if they received the invites and to remind them to RSVP, they ignored her completely.

&#x200B;

And then two weeks before the wedding, Melissa told me her fiance Seth was missing.

&#x200B;

So here's the thing: I had never met Seth. In fact I had only known Melissa for a few months. We met when her car broke down in front of my house, and I offered her my front porch to sit on while she waited for the tow truck. Melissa told me her fiance Seth was on a business trip and that he would be back the week before the wedding.

&#x200B;

And why wouldn't I believe her?

&#x200B;

Melissa and I were instant best friends. I could not wait to meet Seth at the wedding. She talked about him so much that I felt as if I knew him already, and I can honestly say I looked forward to the wedding as much as she did.

&#x200B;

Or maybe, even more.

&#x200B;

Because I loved her very much. I wanted her to be happy. And I could see that wedding planning was stressing her out so bad that she was losing sleep. Even before she broke down in tears and told me nobody was coming, even before Seth went missing, I could see that she was slowly losing her mind.

&#x200B;

\*

&#x200B;

Melissa told me she filed a police report but wasn't expecting much from that end given that Seth was an adult male. I thought sadly that she was probably right. She said she was talking with a private detective and he was looking into it for her.

&#x200B;

A week before the wedding, Melissa came to my house in the middle of the night to tell me she knew where Seth was but we had to move fast. Next thing I knew we were speeding down the highway going out of town.

&#x200B;

I kept asking her what was going on and she kept saying she'll explain when we get there. We drove for hours, stopping once to pee and another time to get gas. It was before sunrise when we started and we were still going when the sun went down.

&#x200B;

Now, I'm not good with maps and wouldn't be able to find my way out of a paper bag, but I can read signs. And even I could tell we were going in circles.

&#x200B;

She first drove across state lines, and then five hours later, she drove back across the same state lines. I remembered the same rest stop we passed in the morning because of a red car that was parked there.

&#x200B;

""Melissa, what is going on?"" I said, but she wouldn't answer me.

&#x200B;

She drove faster and faster. We sped past every other car on the road, and people rage honked at us screaming obscenities. We were going 75 and then 80 and then 90. The car was shaking like a toy and Melissa seemed to be in a trance. She was mentally somewhere else and I was numb, paralyzed with fear. I did not know what to do. I prepared myself to die and then it occurred to me.

&#x200B;

Maybe Seth was dead, maybe she had received news of his body being found and she had gone crazy.

&#x200B;

She swerved in front a truck and I knew it was all over, I felt it in my bones. I wasn't even scared.

&#x200B;

But she hadn't crashed us, only took an exit ramp. And then we were driving slowly down a residential street. She stopped the car in front of a house where a girl was smoking on the porch.

&#x200B;

Melissa turned to me and said, ""They have Seth in that house. His life is in danger. We have to get him out.""

&#x200B;

""That girl?"" I said, incredulous.

&#x200B;

She looked about ninety pounds soaking wet. I could probably take her down myself.

&#x200B;

""There's a whole gang in there,"" said Melissa, ""and she's one of them.""

&#x200B;

And because I was tired and hungry and frightened and confused, I believed her.

&#x200B;

\*

&#x200B;

It was way past midnight when we got back to town. Melissa stopped in front of the all night diner and we went in to get some food. My legs were shaking but she seemed perfectly normal. I tried to act normal too, trying to forget what she had done.

&#x200B;

What *we* had done, a small voice said at the back of my head.

&#x200B;

The events of the previous hours were a blur. Things had happened so fast that it was as if they had happened to somebody else. I still didn't understand and I had a feeling I was never going to. The whole day was like a bad dream.

&#x200B;

I felt faint as we sat down and I pretended to peruse the menu. Even though I loved food more than anything in the world, and I hadn't eaten in the last 20 hours, I had no appetite whatsoever.

&#x200B;

The server gave us a look and then whispered something to another server who got somebody from the back who looked like a manager. The three of them looked at us and seemed to be discussing something. Were the police looking for us? Already?

&#x200B;

The manager came up to our table and said, ""Hey Melissa, long time no see.""

&#x200B;

Melissa said, ""Oh hey, I didn't know you were working tonight.""

&#x200B;

The guy laughed and said, ""I work every night. Who's your lovely friend?""

&#x200B;

A real charmer.

&#x200B;

Melissa introduced me and then she asked him outright if he was coming to the wedding. A shiver went down my back. Her fiance was missing. What wedding was she talking about? He glared at her and then he looked at me and said, ""Want a drink? You look like you could use one."" And then he scurried off like he couldn't get away fast enough.

&#x200B;

Melissa told me that was her cousin.

&#x200B;

When we were done eating, the manager cousin guy came by and said his shift was over and he'll drop us off on his way home. Melissa said she had her car and he was like, ""You shouldn't be driving."" They stared at each other so hard I thought there was going to be words between them. But he said nothing and left the restaurant.

&#x200B;

Melissa and I had a few more drinks, and then went outside to the parking lot and got in her car. She started the car and the car ... didn't move.

&#x200B;

The engine was going but the car wasn't. We got out to investigate and found one of the tires was flat as a pancake even though it was fine when we drove in. And then the manager guy her cousin was somehow right there behind us, scared the shit out of me. He looked me straight in the eye and said with a smirk, ""Looks like you'll need a ride after all.""

&#x200B;

\*

&#x200B;

He dropped Melissa off first. I followed after her because I didn't want to be alone with her creepy cousin, but Melissa went inside her apartment and slammed the door behind her as if she had forgotten I was there.

&#x200B;

I was so surprised I just stood staring at the closed door wanting to kick it down and make her tell me what the hell was going on. Her cousin tried to lead me back to the car but I was like I'll walk.

&#x200B;

""It isn't safe, it's midnight, get in the car,"" he said, or more like, commanded.

&#x200B;

He was a big guy and I knew I wouldn't have a chance if he tried anything funny. So I pretended to get in the car but when he went around to the driver side, I ran away down an alley. I could hear him shouting after me, but I hid in a dumpster until he gave up and left.

&#x200B;

\*

&#x200B;

On the day of the wedding, or the day the wedding was supposed to be, Melissa showed up at my place as if nothing had happened. She said her family was having a BBQ get-together and asked me if I wanted to come.

&#x200B;

Everything in my head screamed no. I no longer trusted her after what she did that night, and I never wanted to see her again. Looking at her made me feel sick. She had told me the girl knew where Seth was. She had told me the girl was in on it and Seth's life was in danger. She had told me there was a whole gang.

&#x200B;

But there was no Seth and no ""gang,"" just a girl in an empty house. And then the blood, so much blood...

&#x200B;

As the days went by, I had began to wonder and then to suspect what exactly I had helped Melissa do. Her entire story had more holes than a cheesecloth. The fact was I barely knew her. She was a mystery to me, and it had been that way from the beginning.

&#x200B;

I hated her and was beginning to be legitimately afraid of her. But something in my heart still belonged to her.

&#x200B;

Anyway, I was wildly curious to meet her family.

&#x200B;

\*

&#x200B;

Melissa's creepy cousin was there at the BBQ. In broad daylight, surrounded by adoring nieces and nephews, he didn't seem so bad, but I reminded myself neither did Ted Bundy.

&#x200B;

Everything was going fine until Melissa started talking about Seth and how the police hadn't done jack shit. To be honest, I was surprised nobody had mentioned it until then. Melissa was working herself up into a real rage and everybody was like they didn't know where to look. Some stared at their phones, a few others left, and her creepy cousin looked pissed. It was a weird scene.

&#x200B;

It was only Melissa's Mom who reacted in a way that made any sense at all. She put her arms around Melissa and told her it was alright. But this was apparently the wrong thing to do because Melissa started screaming for them to leave her alone and ran out of the house. Her mom was like oh my God and started going after her, but the creepy cousin stopped her and said, ""Let her get it out of her system.""

&#x200B;

""What if she gets in the car,"" Melissa's mom said.

&#x200B;

""I have the key,"" the cousin said, showing her the key.

&#x200B;

""Thank God,"" said her mom.

&#x200B;

\*

&#x200B;

""It's the wedding day,"" Melissa's mom said, ""it's like this every year.""

&#x200B;

""Every year?"" I said.

&#x200B;

Last three years, her cousin said.

&#x200B;

Her mom said, ""It happened three years ago. We thought she would get better, come around.""

&#x200B;

""So Seth's been missing for three years?"" I said.

&#x200B;

Her mom stared at me while the others looked embarrassed and fidgety. ""He's not missing,"" she said quietly.

&#x200B;

Her cousin said, ""Melissa was driving, there was an accident, and he died on impact.""

&#x200B;

\*

&#x200B;

""They're lying,"" Melissa said. ""They think I'm crazy, but they're the crazy ones, and now you too.""

&#x200B;

I had mentally prepared myself to ignore her stupid shit and I did. I asked her to take me to the police station so I can see the missing person report she said she had filed, and of course she refused. She said I had no right to ask her (which was true), and that she had thought I was different (appealing to my vanity), but actually I'm just like the rest of them (since vanity didn't work let's try guilt tripping).

&#x200B;

I didn't know what to think.

&#x200B;

Or rather, I knew. For in my obsession with her, I had allowed myself to do evil.

&#x200B;

And then as if she had read my mind, she said: ""You better not tell anybody.""

&#x200B;

And then she smiled.

&#x200B;

And that was how I knew she was not crazy: she was evil.

&#x200B;

""You did it on purpose,"" I said.

&#x200B;

""He was dead asleep when I put him in the car. It was too easy,"" she said. ""Even if they suspected anything, there wasn't enough left of him to autopsy.""

&#x200B;

""And the girl -"" I couldn't continue.

&#x200B;

But I already knew, and it was as if I had known all along.

&#x200B;

""I told her to stay away from him,"" Melissa said, "" Seth was mine. But she didn't listen. You know how they say revenge is best served chilled? Do you think three years was a long enough time?""

&#x200B;

She cackled, and then she came towards me. We were in her apartment. It was midnight and not a single soul knew I was there.

&#x200B;

I said very casually I had no idea what she talking about, and that it was late and I was going home. She shoved me against the wall and slammed my head against it hard. She was so much stronger than she looked.

&#x200B;

""You're the only one who knows,"" she said. ""Don't you see how that can be awkward for me?""

&#x200B;

I thought of the girl that night, the look in her eyes when she saw Melissa, as if what she had feared all her life had come true at last. And in the end, she had seemed almost relieved. I now knew how that poor girl felt. It was exhausting being afraid all the time, looking over your shoulder, waiting for it to happen.

&#x200B;

When Melissa hit me again, I didn't resist and let myself slump against the wall. I knew what she was going to do to me. She had practically told me. I would have gotten into the car myself if only she had asked me, but she wasn't the asking type. She just took. A life here, a life there, it was all the same to her. And the weird thing was, I still couldn't hate her.

&#x200B;

When she pushed the needle into my arm, I felt an overwhelming sense of peace. I was so tired after everything. The last thing I remember thinking about was my cat Ernie I had when I was a kid. Ernie died of renal failure at 18. He died in my arms, and had made biscuits on my sweater up until the end when the vet came to our home to do the euthanasia. My mom wanted to delay it another day because he seemed so content, but Ernie had lost so much weight my father said it wasn't fair to him and the vet agreed with him. I remembered how peaceful Ernie looked afterwards, as if he was sleeping.

&#x200B;

And now, I thought, I will go to be with him.

&#x200B;

""It won't hurt at all,"" a woman's voice said. ""You won't feel a thing.""

&#x200B;

\*

&#x200B;

""She gave you just enough to make you sleep,"" Melissa's cousin told me.

&#x200B;

""And you saved me,"" I said, ""again. How did you know what she was going to do?""

&#x200B;

""I had been keeping an eye on her every night ever since you guys showed up at the diner, so it wasn't so much luck as perseverance,"" he said. ""I knew she was planning something, I could tell.""

&#x200B;

""So you suspected her?""

&#x200B;

""All along. She killed my dog when we were kids, and I guess I saw through her unlike most people.""

&#x200B;

He told me he had been inside her apartment that night, and had used his phone to record her admitting she killed Seth. He hadn't expected her to try to kill me. But when she pushed the needle into my arm, he panicked and realized just as I did that she was fixing to do to me what she had done to Seth. He fought her to the ground and told her he would tell the police who killed Seth, and then he took me to the ER to make sure I was okay. When he went back to Melissa's apartment to confront her again, the police were everywhere. Apparently, she had driven her car into the wall of the parking garage and had died on impact.

&#x200B;

""What about me?"" I said. ""What I did?""

&#x200B;

His face became blank and stupid looking. ""I don't know what you're talking about. Melissa's gone, what more can justice ask for?""

&#x200B;

""You saw through her, it's funny you don't see through me too,"" I said.

&#x200B;

""I see that she lied to you and you fell for her shit just like all the others like I've been seeing my whole life. She was my dog's favorite human and she killed her for nothing.""

&#x200B;

""But if I told you...""

&#x200B;

But he didn't want to hear it.

&#x200B;

\*

&#x200B;

We've been married now for ten years and he still refuses to talk about it. I can feel him look at me sometimes, as if he was doubting his own eyes. One night he told me I looked like Melissa.

&#x200B;

""You were in love with her weren't you,"" he said, just a little accusing.

&#x200B;

""She was my best friend,"" I said.

&#x200B;

""No, I don't mean in that way. I mean, you really loved her. Like a lesbian thing,"" he said.

&#x200B;

I laughed. ""Did you just say 'like a lesbian thing'? What're you, fourteen years old?""

&#x200B;

\*

&#x200B;

""Maybe,"" I said, ""you were a little in love with her yourself. You know, like an incest thing.""

&#x200B;

He didn't deny it.

&#x200B;

""I mean, why else would you help her kill her fiance,"" I said.

&#x200B;

See, ten years is a long time, long enough for me to have finally figured out some things.

&#x200B;

""And she was the only one who knew so you killed her,"" I went on. ""I bet if there had been anything left of her to do an autopsy on, they would have found some pretty interesting stuff.""

&#x200B;

He didn't say anything and neither did I.

&#x200B;

**The Question behind GameStop's return: is the Fed ""instigating"" a short squeeze?**

Mauro Bottarelli

26/05/2021

05/26/2021 - 09:25

*Another record for the reverse repo: the system is bursting with liquidity and the endgame for Quantitative easing is approaching. At the same time, the media returns to recommending purchases of meme stocks and their valuations explode. Just like in February. And the short interest on Standard & Poor's also rises to the maximum of the year. Does anyone think of an ""alternative"" form of using excess cash, by forcibly hedging short positions?*

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/faznilhr4z171.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c200703e5c02dd9d757ccdad4d09df7a448c450

If the reverse repo facility (RRP) has literally exploded with liquidity for days, a symptom that Quantitative easing is dangerously approaching the endgame phase, **how can you buffer the situation without having to accelerate dealing with the facts - and not just words - that taper** that such a deposit trend seems unequivocally to claim? Perhaps, **creating the conditions for another wave of short squeezes similar to that of last February,** capable on the one hand of engaging liquidity on the market for forced hedging of bearish positions and on the other of bringing the retail investor, **burned by sharp declines, closer together. Recoiled but still loaded with stimmy money from the federal program** which will expire at the end of September.

The question arises, connecting the dots of what happened on the market yesterday, almost as if the underground and apparently disconnected moves of the subjects in the game were dots of the mysterious Week. Starting from the reverse repo of the New York Fed and from this graph:

[Source: Bloomberg](https://preview.redd.it/96a76kt25z171.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=0af60ccb51fff8a3b88ef42bd7fc32544fba4ce0)

**433 billion in use, 38 more than the day before, 190 billion more in a week and third highest level ever.** In short, the Fed continues to flood the liquidity market with its purchases of securities on the secondary market for 80 billion per month (plus 40 of Mortgage Backed Securities) but this is beginning to no longer know where to store that cash. **And then he brings it back to the Fed, obtaining as collateral the same Treasuries that the Central Bank drains into the Quantitive Easing.**

A round match. Which, however, is now about to reach its maximum boiling point. The pressure cooker called RRP is whistling ominously. Stronger and stronger. Longer and longer. **Because soon, the collateral will end and with it the possibility of monetizing the debt.** And although, in view of the board of 15-16 June, at least two members of the Fed a day take turns having their say on the taper, **everyone knows that pulling the plug in a really drastic way seems impossible.** A trick is needed. A controlled accident. Or, better yet, a beautiful media event. And here, while 48 counterparties deposited liquidity at the Fed, **two names ended by the wayside were back on Wall Street: GameStop and AMC Entertaiment,** the spearheads of the so-called meme stocks, in the mood for redemption with - respectively - a +29 % and + 16%.

Became a global topic of discussion in February, **when their short squeezes hikes monopolized the headlines and blew up Melvin Capital,** a heavily exposed short and caught hedge fund with totally off guard, suddenly they seem come back in vogue. Like certain sneakers. **Change of management? Merger or Acquisition Announcements? Partnership with Tesla for tourism on Mars?** No, just the fact that they were the first and third most covered topic of the day on WallStreetBets, as the graph shows.

And, consequently, to have then monopolized Twitter and Stocktwits by default. And even in this case, no news relating to the accounts or the business plan guaranteed content to the conversation: **someone threw the stone and everyone followed suit.**

Starting from a very classic theme: AMC's short interest had just returned to all-time highs. **Air of short squeeze, in short.** As irresistible as the scent of croissants in the morning. All said and done, the tweets have turned into facts. That is, purchases. **At 2.35pm yesterday afternoon (New York time) they had changed hands some 123 million AMC stocks,** becoming the second most traded among those valued above $ 1. Retail trading on GameStop is also less aggressive but still very active, with 8 million shares traded, more than double what happened in the last 10 sessions. The reason? The short interest of the video game chain is still unappetizing for a frontal attack strategy, as the graph shows.

summarizes the day: **the basket of stocks most followed and traded by users of WallStreetBets - with a clear aim of short squeeze - marked the greatest increase since the beginning of April.** Without a reason, in fact. But you know, **anyone can write anonymously and covered by nicknames on those chats.** Perhaps, stirring the spirits of those who want to punish the real banksters of Wall Street, hitting them with their own weapons. Perhaps, by typing those appeals to the revolutionary use of the security account from a computer of a neat desk of some bank or hedge fund that buys trading flows from Robinhood to set up its algorithms\*\*. And who, also being a Primary dealer, is now joining\*\* **forces with the Fed to avoid a repo apocalypse**

But here's this chart:

&#x200B;

[Source: Bloomberg](https://preview.redd.it/36q16i216z171.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc395d95c2d30d730a456aaa05d1d73b47b26f31)

shows how in a further and suspicious contemporary, the short interest on the ETF that traces the Standard & Poor's 500 - SPY, a giant worth 357 billion - has risen to the maximum level since the beginning of the year. **About 4.8% of the fund's shares are now on loan pending a collapse in valuations, just as the index fluctuates at an all-time high.** A month and a half ago that percentage was 2% and 1.7% at the beginning of the year. Of course, during 2020 that level had risen several times above 7% but today's timing appears decidedly different. At the time, in fact, the market was suffering from the evolution of the pandemic but benefited from the support of central banks that appeared to force four and indefinite, **today instead we talk more and more frequently and openly about tapering that stimulus.**

In short, potentially, two bearish pressures are joining forces in their bet against the market, both at the level of meme stocks and the Wall Street benchmark index. So, if it is a short squeeze, **triggered by any gust of optimism (true and presumed) from the Fed or the Treasury or Congress,** some other hedge fund seems destined to join Melvin Capital. **Triggering a period of great tension, with thunderous but controlled declines and an increase in VIX: ideal for burning some liquidity.** Thus avoiding it ends up in the reverse repo facility, which will deflate like the short interest of these days. And in this way it will stop putting further pressure on the decisions - real and concrete - of the Fed. But maybe, it's just fanta-finance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nneg7p/european_financial_news_is_reporting_that_hedge/,CuriousCatNYC777,2021-05-29 08:24:23,7661,Superstonk
"The Gayest Gay Bear Post in the History of WSB. We are HEADED DOWN, Folks!!!","# Update (12/8/20):

For those who missed it, I've upped this bet to include a tattoo on my ass if I'm wrong. But I won't be wrong.

### [UPPING THE ANTE: If SPY closes below 360 by next Friday I will donate $100 to the top 10 commentors below. If SPY closes above 375 next Friday I will get JPow's face and ""Don't Fight The Fed"" tattooed on my ass.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6z61n/upping_the_ante_if_spy_closes_below_360_by_next/)

# UPDATE (11/30/20):

Stock futures are currently at around +0.80%. I'm down as fuck on my positions as most of you already know...

I stated before I never put more than 10k into short term options plays, which is how I've lasted 20 years in this game.

These are extreme times. I am now putting that rule on hold. If these futures hold up, tomorrow I am dumping another 10k into my SPY puts and VXX calls. I am literally doubling down to a 20k total bet.

This extra 10k will be January/February dated since my December timing appears to be early.

Still conservative strikes: VXX 22c, SPY 350p, TLT 162c

Hello again. SVM/??? here with another fuckin banger. LET'S GOOOO!!!!!

# Introduction:

The market is going to tank. Let me just give a bit of background so you know why my opinion is better than yours...

I am not a bear. I am not a bull. I go where the market tells me to go, I bet where it tells me to bet. And right now, the indicators are telling me to take a strong bearish position. So that's what I have been doing.

I've been trading more than 20 years. I was trading the great financial crash while most of you were watching fucking Spongebob or whatever the fuck you kids jerked it to. This is not my primary job, but I make a good deal of cash on the side every month, timing the market and swing trading broad market ETFs. I do my research, I know my shit, and I rarely touch your shitty meme stocks. I'm doing you all a favor of once again sharing my insights into this market, so you too can share in my profits and maybe learn a thing or two.

I will lay this out as cleanly as I can, offering multiple premises for my bearish bet and explaining them in detail. I've covered some of this in the past, but wanted to consolidate everything and more in one place. **This post will be long. If you want to cry about that rather than thank me for my service, you will go broke soon and deserve it cuz you are a lazy fuck.** PRESSING FORWARD!

&#x200B;

**Primary Bearish Premises:**

**Premise 1: The Market is Massively Overvalued (Macro)**

**Premise 2: SPY is Topping Off and Running on Vaccine Fumes (TA)**

**Premise 3: The Fed CANNOT Print Money You Retards (Facts)**

**Premise 4: Quantitative Easing is Deflationary (Theory)**

**Premise 5: Credit Markets are Contracting (Data)**

**Premise 6: Banks are Loading Up on Safe Bonds While Retail Loads Up on Stocks (Data)**

**Premise 7: Unemployment is Still Sky High (Data)**

&#x200B;

# Premise 1: The Market is Massively Overvalued

There are plenty of small, detail arguments for a bearish position. Covid cases rising, election uncertainty, stimulus failing, and so on. Plenty of others have made this case, so I won't focus on the small scale issues such as these.

What I want to give you is a larger, macro picture. Because the market is simply overvalued, period. The market has become divorced from the overall economy. I understand tech, and why they have a bullish case for growth in the face of Covid lockdowns... My point here is that you need some REAL WORLD measures to tie ""future earnings"" down to reality, to prevent irrational euphoria from taking over your mind.

There are plenty of indicators out there showing that stocks are overvalued. We could talk about insane P/E ratios, about euphoric meme stock flops like NKLA, and so on. The metric I'm going to present here is not new by any stretch. It isn't unique or original. But it is undeniably useful, and carries strong weight, whether modern traders wish to shun it and its originator or not. I'm talking about the Buffet Indicator.

https://preview.redd.it/oem2uhz714061.png?width=1008&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1f7e97544eba52859b986af68b4b80556660e43

For those of you new to this concept, it is simply the total stock market valuation divided by GDP. The point is to compare total market valuations with some hard, trailing, real-world metric, in this case GDP. When market valuations uncouple strongly from actual market conditions, it is a strong signal of irrational stock valuations. And that presents opportunity for those paying attention.

Note that **this chart has already been detrended down to account for historically rising P/E ratios**, and it still shows a strongly overvalued market, equal to what was seen during the DotCom bubble. That's bad news, folks.

This is the REAL issue in the present market, and why buyers are becoming exhausted. Covid, instability, elections, stimulus... These are all just catalysts to give that equity bubble a little prick. Only the dumbest of the dumb are still ""buying the dip"" under current market conditions, which means mostly clueless retail gamblers on WSB. All these perma-bulls are doing is offering liquidity to the institutional investors to help get them out of their positions. In the end, we all know who is left holding the bag.

# Premise 2: The Market is Topping Off and Running on Vaccine Fumes

I'm not a big believer in technical analysis. Most of it is bullshit, astrological voodoo if you ask me. But some of it works, and when technical analysis works, it is simply being used as a proxy for assessing market sentiment and emotions. Let's take a closer look at the teaser SPY chart I posted above.

https://preview.redd.it/h0ndq2a914061.png?width=1808&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fe30a5ad23952719c69c6634debe7fe8c0832af

As you can see, the market has been repeatedly rejecting multiple new highs. This process was briefly interrupted by positive vaccine news. We breached a new high on Pfizer vaccine results, but even that new high was instantly rejected and resulted in a sudden reversal selloff. The Moderna vaccine news created another short rally, lower than the Pfizer high, and that too was followed by a selloff. **In other words, the market is continually rejecting current market valuations.** As they should be, if you were following the point above. We are running on vaccine news fumes, and those will not last long. If you develop an instinct for these things, you can almost feel it in your gut: The market WANTS to head down.

If this isn't the top, it is close to it. $366.77 will very likely be the high for SPY for the year, and will soon unwind downwards.

# Premise 3: The Fed CANNOT Print Money

I know this will come as a shock to most of you idiots but the fucking money printer does NOT GO BRRRRR.

The Fed has to follow the laws that govern it's actions. The Fed does not have the legal authority to simply print cash and hand it out. Go ahead and read the Federal Reserve Act, and take a look at the Fed's actions, for proof of this. It doesn't even have the authority to print cash to buy corporate bonds or anything else.

What the Fed ""prints"" is called ""reserves.""

[ Source: https:\/\/www.stlouisfed.org\/open-vault\/2019\/august\/open-market-operations-monetary-policy-tools-explained](https://preview.redd.it/8ibo0kud14061.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=626a1464cd76296ee9d435a5c69f182e4286f9d6)

So what, you say? So everything. The key point about reserves is that they cannot be spent like cash can. When a bank gets reserve funds in its reserve account at the Fed, it CANNOT SPEND that money. All the bank can do is use that account as collateral to lend against. Which means **if the banks are not lending, those QE funds are NOT entering the economy.** They might as well not exist. And banks are not lending, as we will see below.

This is the counter argument to all the ignorant retail traders who will argue that the Fed is ""backstopping"" stocks, or that the Fed will not ""allow"" the market to crash. The Fed has no power to print money, and therefore no power to buy stocks, and therefore no power to prevent a crash. The Fed's power is illusory, but enough people buy the illusion to make it effective. That won't last forever.

Just think about it. If Fed actions and QE really made stocks rally the way people claim it does, why isn't the Japan Nikkei constantly breaking new all time highs???

# Premise 4: Quantitative Easing is Deflationary

Quantitative Easing is not Cash. In fact, QE is deflationary.

Here is how QE works, in a nutshell. The Fed buys bonds from the big banks. Except the Fed isn't buying them with cash. In exchange for the bonds, the Fed puts funds in a reserve account held by the bank. These reserve funds CANNOT BE TOUCHED by the banks. All the banks can do is use this account as collateral to lend against.

In fact, it's worse than that. Because the Fed is removing assets from the open market, and not paying cash for them. It is purchasing liquid assets with illiquid reserves. Despite all the Fed's talk about ""creating liquidity,"" what the Fed is actually doing is REMOVING liquidity from the system!

Why would they do this? Answer: To lower interest rates. Don't take my word for it, the Fed explains this itself!

[ Source: https:\/\/www.stlouisfed.org\/open-vault\/2019\/august\/open-market-operations-monetary-policy-tools-explained ](https://preview.redd.it/bzl5jfpf14061.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4c96c8e3b741867281f43b5472c634c85cba5bf)

See, the Fed has to follow the laws that govern its actions. Despite what the public believes, the Fed does not have the legal authority to simply print money and hand it out. The Fed knows that the true source of inflation in a debt-based economy is through **credit expansion.** So the Fed does everything it can to reduce interest rates, both by setting reserve rates near zero and by using QE to drive rates down further.

Only when credit expansion revives will we begin to see inflation and a true recovery. The Fed knows their hands are tied, which is why they keep hammering Congress to pass more stimulus.

Perhaps the greatest strength of the Fed is in ""forward guidance."" The Fed simply uses words to convince the public that money is being printed, that inflation is coming, so that people go out and spend and buy assets. They are playing a trick on the public, and the trick is working. People actually believe inflation is coming, that stocks are being held up by the Fed, that money is pouring into the system. The public is wrong on every count.

The Fed is trying to contract credit markets in order to lower interest rates in order to eventually spur lending in order to eventually create inflation. But in the meantime, QE is deflationary. As stated above, if reserve funds are not being lent out by the banks, they do not enter the economy, and thus QE serves a deflationary role. Let's take a look at the next premise, that banks are contracting the credit markets.

# Premise 5: Credit Markets are Contracting

The question of whether banks are lending or not with their QE reserves is simply a matter of looking at the data. Practically every data source we can point to suggests contracting credit conditions. This means QE reserves are not entering the economy, and therefore are not producing inflation nor holding up stocks.

**The SLOOS data from the Fed, Oct. 2020:**

Real Estate lending is booming, you say? Not so....

**Banks Lending is TIGHTENING:**

Note: The decline near the end doesn't represent growth in credit, but represents a reduction in the RATE of tightening.

**Consumer Demand for Loans is SHRINKING:**

**Even Credit Card debt growth is negative!**

# Premise 6: Banks are Loading Up on Safe Bonds While Retail Loads Up on Stocks

If you are like me, you look forward to the H.8 data every Friday from the Fed (yeah right haha). A continuing trend in that data, month after month after month, is that major banks in the US have been loading up on bonds with no end in sight. They are piling more and more cash into safe assets, now up to a whopping $4.6 TRILLION in securities.

[Source: https:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/releases\/h8\/current\/default.htm](https://preview.redd.it/tn38ss3p14061.png?width=1219&format=png&auto=webp&s=7dc1c06695685a883599315abc9e36047128e687)

Meanwhile, retail traders (that means you) keep piling into stocks at all time highs. A record amount of cash was dumped into the market after the vaccine news breaks. I'm just gonna go ahead and call it now. This is the top.

[Source: https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2020-11-13\/stock-funds-get-record-44-5-billion-inflows-on-vaccine-optimism](https://preview.redd.it/xogj0z2q14061.png?width=1314&format=png&auto=webp&s=c466b29277d6f047781fd9156bd476b3b1c011f1)

# Premise 7: Unemployment is Still Sky High

I bring this up just to reiterate another real-world metric that is gloomy as fuck and yet completely ignored from market valuations. Why are stocks breaking all-time highs when we still have MILLIONS more unemployed than we did this time last year? Hello McFly?

https://preview.redd.it/jda435zq14061.png?width=1164&format=png&auto=webp&s=3929064c0e9d6ae120201ad4295e02cca2bdcf45

# Conclusion:

**Shit's fucked up son.** Real world economy is still in shambles. Market is more overvalued than it was during the DotCom boom. Still millions unemployed. The market is topping off and rejecting highs again and again. The Fed is not printing money and not backstopping assets, despite claims to the contrary. We are heading down, folks!

**Positions:**

**SPY 350p 12/18**

**VXX 22c 12/18**

Also anything else that strikes your fancy. IWM, GLD, SLV puts are all fine (dollar is going to rise). Longer dated TLT calls will print as well due to QE reducing bond yields, eventually. Go longer or shorted dated depending on personal risk tolerance.

**Timing can be difficult. My strategy is to periodically enter bearish positions when short-term indicators look good, and hope to eventually time the major dump. If things begin to stabilize short-term I exit the position quickly with a small gain or, rarely, a small loss.**

Burning Cash Part II,"**TL:DR: An analysis of the Credit Suisse Report reveals aspects from Archegos' journey to default that we can learn from and use to better assess future behavior from SHFs and banks leading to MOASS. We also discover that Credit Suisse not only was hit hard from the default of Archegos, but they also had tons of GME shorts, which are now the burden of UBS (the bank that absorbed Credit Suisse). Once UBS burns through their cash to the point of default, the market will most likely crash, and GME will MOASS.**

§1: What We Can Learn From the Credit Suisse Report

§2: UBS Default Will Likely Crash the Market

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**§0: Preface**

It brings me great pleasure to be able to share this DD with my Ape fam. It's been a while since I last posted here, but I've noticed that Reddit has changed drastically since then. Honestly, free speech on Reddit is heavily restricted nowadays, to the point where it's hard to convey messages or freely share information with other Apes; I'm not gonna pretend it's all sunshine and rainbows. I made a post on my own profile back in January (not even on any sub), and Reddit removed it, even though I was sharing publicly available information to help Apes discern the network of shills that SHFs employ. So, it's just really hard to share anything here. And I know that Reddit now doesn't allow SuperStonk to tag or talk about other Reddit users, so if there's an Ape that shared material information that I want to expand on and use in my DD, I'm not able to give them credit, which is insane. So, just a lot of things in general I wanted to voice my concern on. If I were to guess why there's not as many active users on SuperStonk as before, it's probably because of the increasingly stringent regulations Reddit continues to place on this specific sub. It makes it harder for all of us, but I suppose we work with what we got.

https://i.redd.it/jci2ena5vfqb1.gif

As for this DD, it's essential to first analyze the Credit Suisse Report before we get into what it all entails going forward, and why we're in strong territory for a market crash. There's also a lot of critical information in general we can obtain from the report to better understand how firms operate behind the facade PR show they put on.

**§1: What We Can Learn From the Credit Suisse Report**

[The Credit Suisse Report](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1159510/000137036821000064/a210729-ex992.htm) gives us a glimpse into what led to the default of Archegos, which subsequently led to the collapse of Credit Suisse, and how this will affect the Market, and GME, going forward.

As you may or may not already know, Archegos was heavily overleveraged (mostly on long Chinese ADR positions), and once their margin requirements overwhelmed their existing margins, they took a bit hit and collapsed on March 2021. There's a lot to take away from the July 2021 Credit Suisse Report.

In January 2021, ""in connection with its 2020 annual credit review, CRM (Credit Suisse's client-risk management) downgraded Archegos’ credit rating from BB- to B+, which put Archegos in the bottom-third of CS’s hedge fund counterparties by rating,""-pg 18.

[pg. 104 of the Credit Suisse Report](https://preview.redd.it/0hnq4m3akfqb1.png?width=616&format=png&auto=webp&s=b84a43ac2cd1f6879c9f33e547c1d7ff3d4b60ed)

Furthermore, the report states, ""CRM noted that, while in prior years Archegos had estimated that **its portfolio could be liquidated within a few days, Archegos now estimated that it would take “between two weeks and one month” to liquidate its full portfolio.** The CRM review also noted that implementing dynamic margining for Archegos was a “major focus area” of the business and Risk in 2021.""

Note that this (2 weeks-to-one month timeline for liquidation) is just for the positions Archegos was in that were primarily long positions, such as Viacom CBS and the Chinese ADRs. Now, imagine how long it would take a SHF to liquidate their short positions on GME, a stock obstinately held by an army of Apes across the world? A stock that has about 50% of its free-float directly registered. A stock that insiders have been consistently purchasing themselves? I imagine this being a long-game, especially during the time of MOASS. When MOASS comes, I expect this to be draw out for several months at minimum, could last over a year, due to SEC halts alone. That's another reason why DRS Apes will thrive, and options gamblers stuck with options expiry dates and likely broker issues are going to be disappointed. MOASS will be nothing like January 2021. SHFs are prepared, the government is prepared—this is not going to be an options friendly game like back then. Not even RobinHood defaulted back in Jan 2021. During MOASS, expect inevitable broker defaults.

On page 21 we find that ""The business \[business and risk of Credit Suisse\] continued to chase Archegos on the dynamic margining proposal to no avail; indeed, the **business scheduled three follow-up calls in the five business days before Archegos’ default, all of which Archegos cancelled at the last minute.** Moreover, during the several weeks that Archegos was “considering” this dynamic margining proposal, it began calling the excess variation margin it had historically maintained with CS \[Credit Suisse\]. Between March 11 and March 19, and despite the fact that the dynamic margining proposal sent to Archegos was being ignored, CS paid Archegos a total of $2.4 billion—all of which was approved by PSR and CRM. **Moreover, from March 12 through March 26, the date of Archegos’ default, Prime Financing permitted Archegos to execute $1.48 billion of additional net long positions, though margined at an average rate of 21.2%,""**\-pg 21.

Archegos was permitted to make high risk trades as they continued to avoid literal margin calls from its Prime Broker. What can we learn from this? That it is likely before MOASS, SHFs will continue to short GME and use whatever the playbook allows them until they literally are no longer permitted.

Archegos didn't go down easily. Even when margin called, they tried to fight it with an offer for a standstill agreement.

On page 23 of the Credit Suisse Report, we see that, ""on the call, Archegos informed its brokers that it had $120 billion in gross exposure and just $9-$10 billion in remaining equity. **Archegos asked its prime brokers to enter into a standstill agreement, whereby the brokers would agree not to default Archegos while it liquidated its positions. The prime brokers declined.** On the morning of March 26, CS delivered an Event of Default notice to Archegos and began unwinding its Archegos positions. **CS lost approximately $5.5 billion as a result of Archegos’ default and the resulting unwind**.""

The collapse of Archegos happened because their friends (i.e. the prime brokers) didn't bail them out, they didn't try to reach anymore compromises with Archegos, and didn't let them liquidate their own positions (which I'm sure there would've been trickery involved there). They told Archegos the game was over. This is comparable to when [the Fed withheld emergency bailout money from the Lehman Brothers](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/0hm9s8hk). The collapse is contingent on someone coming in and saying ""no, the game is over. Game Stop 😉"".

And when CS \[Credit Suisse\] stopped the game for Archegos, they took a $5.5 billion hit to their portfolio. Nomura, UBS, and Morgan Stanley lost $2.9 billion, $774 million, and $1 billion respectively, as a result of the default (pg 129).

Now, what if the default of Archegos was determined to lead to the collapse of all the prime brokers as well? Would they still say ""game over"", or would they try to bail out Archegos or agree to a standstill and try to see if Archegos can stay afloat with whatever their managed liquidation was going to be?That is the dilemma banks and brokers are facing.

It may seem contrary to my DD last year ""[SHFs Can & Will Get Margin Called](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/vrwfjt/shfs_can_will_get_margin_called/),"" but it's not. SHFs can still get margin called, Archegos very much got margin called, but prime brokers, regulatory agencies, etc., might be incentivized to waive some margin, or enter some ""bail out"" agreement in an attempt to prolong the SHF's survival, since it affects their own as well. This is akin to Citadel bailing out Melvin Capital and UBS bailing out Credit Suisse. Another example would be when the NSCC waived RobinHood's Excess Capital Premium charge in 2021 in exchange for turning off the buy button, because RobinHod's collapse would've snowballed to other brokers as well. But, there comes a point where, if the price of GME gets too high, **the core margin requirements that can't be waived will trigger a liquidation**, unless prime brokers/clearing companies bail them out. **Without that bail out, they have to accept a collapse, which is what happened to Archegos in March 26, 2021**. You can't bail out everything, because that's basically the same as throwing all your money in a black hole and destroying your currency completely. But you can try to reach some sort of compromise to stave off an impending crash. That's why MOASS has been delayed, not stopped, but delayed since 2021.

On page 37, the Credit Suisse Report explains the synthetic leverage they offer, which Archegos got in that led to the margin calls on March 2021:

"" **CS’s Prime Financing offers clients access to certain derivative products, such as swaps, that reference single stocks, stock indices, and custom baskets of stocks.** These swaps allow clients to obtain “synthetic” leveraged exposure to the underlying stocks without actually owning them.  As in Prime Brokerage, CS earns revenue in Prime Financing from its financing activities as well as trade execution.""

They do mention that CS offers their client a custom ""basket of stocks"", which I would reasonably speculate include the ""meme basket"" in some way, due to their heavy GME shorts, which are discussed later in this DD.

The report explains how risky these synthetic trades are on pages 36 and 37.

Basically, as with traditional financing, you can leverage $5,000 into $25,000 with a margin requirement of 20%. If the stock drops, you lose a serious amount of equity and can be in big trouble. But, if the stock goes up, you 5x your gains and make a small fortune. This is the type of gambling that the big boys in Wall Street like to do.

On top of that comes the synthetic game:

""The client could obtain synthetic exposure to the same stock without actually purchasing it.  As just one example of how such synthetic financing might work, the client would enter into a derivative known as a total return swap (“TRS”) with its Prime Broker.  Again, assuming a margin requirement of 20%, the client could put up $5,000 in margin and the Prime Broker would agree to pay the client the amount of the increase in the price of the asset over $25,000 over a given period of time.  In return, the client would agree to pay the amount of any decrease in the value of the stock below $25,000, as well as an agreed upon interest rate over the life of the swap, regardless of how the underlying stock performed,""-pg 37.

[pg. 39](https://preview.redd.it/5qebbeqjkfqb1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=566f3ad2e422744bc11fcf51cef6ed6305d80bd4)

This is what Archegos was engaged in and how they were able to get so overleveraged to the point where their exposure (and essentially risk) was 12x more than their equity. And when it comes to liquidating it, because of that vast exposure, liquidating their positions could move the market itself, leading to exponentially growing losses. Once again, the reason why SHFs never want to close their short positions. Everything looks nice on paper, until the synthetics are liquidated.

[pg. 79](https://preview.redd.it/tyz0oivlkfqb1.png?width=618&format=png&auto=webp&s=d02cb3b5e078e1abf143fb99a3889e833a8855d0)

This is further evident on page 69:

""Underscoring the volatility of Archegos’ returns, **Archegos reported being up 40.7%, year-over-year, as of June 30, 2018, but ended the year down 36%.**""

This is why it doesn't matter if someone calls you a ""conspiracy theorist"" for not believing the bought out media telling you that Citadel and SIG are doing great year after year, when they're hiding their losses in their swaps. Once again, everything looks nice on paper, until it comes time to liquidate the synthetics. In the case of MOASS, the GME shorts. The emperor has no clothes.

Pages 87-88:

""To mitigate Archegos’ long Chinese ADR exposure, **the trading desk worked with Archegos to create custom equity basket swaps that Archegos shorted**.  While these baskets, like the index shorts, may have helped address scenario limit breaches (since these scenarios shocked the entire market equally so shorts would offset longs), they were not effective hedges of the significant, idiosyncratic (that is, company-specific) risk in Archegos’ small number of large, concentrated long positions in a small number of industry sectors.""

It is speculation, but I do wonder if Credit Suisse had Archegos allocate some of their funds shorting the basket stocks, in exchange for leniency, which Credit Suisse did give until March 2021. On page 128, we do find that Credit Suisse only liquidated 97% of Archegos' portfolio, and they never mention if the other 3% were ever liquidated. It is possible that CS absorbed GME basket swaps from Archegos and didn't liquidate them. But, again, it's speculation. Whether or not it's true is immaterial, because Credit Suisse was already fucked carrying GME short positions that, if liquidated, would cause a market crash, but we'll get to that later.

On pages 126-127, we see that Archegos proposed a standstill, where they'd try to liquidate their positions themselves, and the prime brokers would agree not to default Archegos/ The prime brokers refused:

""On the evening of March 25, Archegos held a call with its prime brokers, including CS. On the call, Archegos informed its brokers that, while it still had $9 to $10 billion in equity (a decrease of approximately $10 billion from its reported equity the day before), it had $120 billion in gross exposure ($70 billion in long exposure and $50 billion in short exposure). **Archegos asked the prime brokers to enter into a standstill agreement, whereby all of the brokers would agree not to default Archegos, while Archegos wound down its positions.** While CS was open to considering some form of managed liquidation agreement, it remained firm in its decision to issue a notice of termination, which was sent by email that evening, and followed up by hand-delivery on the morning of March 26, designating March 26 as the termination date.""

Despite that, even after the default on March 26, Archegos had a call with its prime brokers to try to orchestrate a forbearance agreement with them (pg 127).

On page 133, we find that only CS, UBS, and Nomura were interested in a managed liquidation; however, Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman weren't interested in any sort of managed liquidation.

As such, Archegos had no lifeline, no last change to try to survive with a managed liquidation where they could attempt to mitigate their losses in any way via open market or dark pool. Hence, the story ends for Archegos, and Credit Suisse (later UBS) will never be the same afterwards.

**§2: UBS Default Will Likely Crash the Market**

We know that Archegos collapsed in 2021, and Credit Suisse took a significant hit to their portfolio. However, 2 years later, Credit Suisse collapsed on March 2023. Why did they collapse? Well, they were already struggling beforehand. [Clients pulled $119 billion from Credit Suisse](https://www.investopedia.com/what-happened-at-credit-suisse-and-why-did-it-collapse-7369825) in July and August 2022, based on rumors of failures. And on March 2023, with the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, that shock only made matters worse for Credit Suisse.

Archegos obviously isn't the only one that was overleveraged in swaps here. There's a reason the Federal Reserve Repo rate has went up 1,000x in the past years. The banks, SHFs, and brokers are all overleveraged. It's not sustainable in the slightest.

https://preview.redd.it/ogw3vj8okfqb1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6cd9e0e1962b1608b6e2b913c3ab7547d6a95c4

But, in the specific case of Credit Suisse, they are outright carrying GME short positions—short positions large enough that they would've gotten wiped out had GME kept shooting up in Jan 2021:

Page 110 of the CRedit Suisse Report: ""**You’ll recall they took an $800mm+ PnL hit in CS \[Credit Suisse\] portfolio during “Gamestop short squeeze” week \[at the end of January\]**.  We were fortunate that we happened to be holding more than $900mm in margin excess on that day, so no resulting margin call.  Since then, they’ve pretty much swept all of their excess, **so think the prospect of a $700-$800mm margin call is very real if we see similar moves** (also why $500mm severe stress shortfall limit not only reasonable, but also plausible with more extreme moves).""

Had Switzerland allowed Credit Suisse to default, the global market would've crashed, and GME would MOASS. However, that's not what happened. [As reported by the March 19, 2023 Credit Suisse Press Release on the Credit Suisse and UBS Merger](https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us-news/en/articles/media-releases/credit-suisse-and-ubs-to-merge-202303.html), The Swiss Federal Council issued a ""Notverordnung"", which is German for ""emergency ordinance"":

https://preview.redd.it/fwahripqkfqb1.png?width=891&format=png&auto=webp&s=09e370716f0acb8ff5eb418f4112536930628e51

UBS merged with Credit Suisse on March 2023, which was then filed with the SEC via their F-4 the following month:

https://preview.redd.it/matupd2skfqb1.png?width=880&format=png&auto=webp&s=2949d8832e6fbc47d3892b0c72e23e8e01061a1e

With the merger, the GME shorts don't have to be liquidated (yet), and the can continues to get kicked... at least until UBS collapses.

https://preview.redd.it/ep5ez8qtkfqb1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0146e0bcdf968bea05ae038822321bc03fa18b2

Of course, as I pointed out in my ""[Burning Cash](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/v0zrni/burning_cash/)"" DD, as time goes on, these banks/SHFs will keep burning through cash shorting GME until their available margin can no longer satisfy their margin requirements, and they themselves tank. And UBS' situation had been getting worse post merger.

https://preview.redd.it/3yiy25fvkfqb1.png?width=928&format=png&auto=webp&s=c429b85c1f3080420e061c2dc3dddb6260c93054

I remember after the merger announcement between UBS and Credit Suisse, long-term put options on UBS increased exponentially. And, although the CDS dropped back down from their highs on March 2023, their CDS' are still on an increasing trend on the 5 year chart:

https://preview.redd.it/o2bl6juwkfqb1.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e284f9cefaac1fa8fdee103497c0c995bc31b96

According to Macroaxis, **UBS' probability of bankruptcy is standing at nearly 30%**:

https://preview.redd.it/05b0947ykfqb1.png?width=788&format=png&auto=webp&s=88e007d9638618c097f0f9f8af1d5654167168a6

However, I believe we can get a clearer view of what lies ahead for UBS via the Altman Z score model.

The Altman Z-Score model is a financial formula that is used to predict the likelihood of a company going bankrupt within the next 2 years. It's credible, widely recognized for bankruptcy risk assessment, and empirically validated.

The formula is listed as shown:

https://preview.redd.it/knzybfjzkfqb1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b28406cb1a5b79057c4a195c670d51a1c008c5e

[The Corporate Financial Institute](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/commercial-lending/altmans-z-score-model/) notes the Altman Z-Score results as the following:

https://preview.redd.it/c6cj4e01lfqb1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce284ee1fcc9aa32e116ac2ac414c2446c0087cf

""Usually, the lower the Z-score, the higher the odds that a company is heading for bankruptcy. A **Z-score that is lower than 1.8 means that the company is in financial distress and with a high probability of going bankrupt.** On the other hand, a score of 3 and above means that the company is in a safe zone and is unlikely to file for bankruptcy. A score of between 1.8 and 3 means that the company is in a grey area and with a moderate chance of filing for bankruptcy.""

The Altman Z-Score actually predicted [the 2008 financial crisis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/altman.asp#:~:text=A%20score%20below%201.8%20signals,value%20is%20closer%20to%201.8), assessing the median score of companies in 2007 at 1.81. Again, this model is time-tested and golden.

For example, GameStop's Z Score is listed at **7.13**:

https://preview.redd.it/tz4rm9k2lfqb1.png?width=804&format=png&auto=webp&s=b70fa5a125037ddb6085d7459261f8d13a3355fe

This means that the company is safe from bankruptcy. Very safe. Not only that, but it is projected to gain a significant increase of revenue in the future (which it has already been doing excellently this year), further validating my ""[Economic Principles of GameStop](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/w22nvo/economic_principles_of_gamestop/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)"" DD last year.

To put GameStop's Z-Score in perspective, it's nearly as strong as Amazon's (7.44), meaning that the probability of GME going bankrupt is nearly as much as Amazon. And why shouldn't it be? GameStop has +$1 billion cash on hand, **had a recent profitable quarter** ([something that most Tech companies haven't been able to achieve](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/01/more-money-losing-companies-than-ever-are-going-public.html#:~:text=Through%20last%20Friday%2C%2083%20percent,the%20highest%20proportion%20on%20record)), and an expanding NFT Marketplace.

As for UBS, their Z Score is listed at **0.16**:

https://preview.redd.it/jo4a5i84lfqb1.png?width=796&format=png&auto=webp&s=edcfc57a33ceab7c2e783e56efa605cd6108873b

This means the likelihood of them going bankrupt within 2 years is very high.

[Penpoin](https://penpoin.com/altman-z-score/) states, ""In an early paper, [Altman found a Z-Score 72% accurate](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2978933?seq=1) at predicting bankruptcy two years before the event. In subsequent tests, [the Altman Z-Score’s accuracy ](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~ealtman/Zscores.pdf)was between 80% and 90%.""

Whether or not you want to be conservative with the estimates, the probability of UBS going bankrupt within the next few years is very likely. This is something you can notice empirically.

https://preview.redd.it/hp89kds5lfqb1.png?width=991&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7eb21ae0adf969636cc739c4221279e554ed4b1

Last month, the DOJ ordered UBS to pay $1.435 billion for its actions that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis. As I pointed out in ""[Burning Cash](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/v0zrni/burning_cash/)"", the DOJ has taken a big step towards combatting white-collar crime since last year. The DOJ considers market manipulation to be a national security issue, especially when you consider the fact that it has the potential to undermine and destabilize the country's financial infrastructure and beget a market crash. UBS is likely under the DOJ probe that began in December 2021 (not to mention they've been under DOJ investigation for [obstruction of justice](https://money.usnews.com/investing/news/articles/2023-03-23/credit-suisse-ubs-among-banks-facing-u-s-s-russia-sanctions-probe-bloomberg-news)), and they will have to navigate under that probe.

And, that's just on the regulatory level.

According to the BBC, UBS ""[cut 3,000 jobs despite record $29 bn profit](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66668735)"". Side note on UBS' alleged ""profit"", by the way, I already demonstrated in §1 of this DD that firms like Archegos can bullshit on paper and make their firms seem like they're profiting insanely, up until they get margin called and the real picture surrounding their financial situation starts to get revealed. It's unfortunately too easy for SHFs/banks to artificially inflate their numbers through swaps or leverage, then send it to the press to say that ""they're profiting like never before."" As Sun Tzu best said it, ""appear strong when you are weak.""

UBS absorbed Credit Suisse, and along with Credit Suisse came their massive bags of GME shorts. That's UBS' problem now. They can never close those shorts, because in doing so they'd initiate MOASS. So, they have to, along with the SHFs, continue to short GME, absorb the interest rates, the fees, and keep burning through their money ensuring that GME stays low enough as to not completely destroy their margins.

We already know that UBS has a high likelihood of bankruptcy within the next 2 years. When they collapse, and they will, the question is: will anyone step in? I don't think so. UBS absorbed Credit Suisse, in part because of the pressure from the Swiss Government. UBS is the largest bank in Switzerland. There's no one else that the Swiss Government can have absorb UBS.

How about globally?

Well, first we should determine UBS' market cap and aum (assets under management). Reports of their aum vary, but the most recent one I found ([a UBS job listing from September 18](https://careers.usc.edu/jobs/ubs-financial-services-inc-wealth-strategy-associate-2/#:~:text=UBS%20is%20one%20of%20the,billion%20in%20assets%20under%20management)) states that ""UBS is one of the largest wealth management firms in the world with $2.6 trillion in assets under management"". Assuming it's true, it puts UBS as genuinely one of the biggest in the world, the only ones bigger are mostly Chinese banks. As of June 30, the only American Bank with a higher aum than UBS would be JP Morgan, according to the [Federal Reserve Statistical Release](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/lbr/current/).

https://preview.redd.it/cerh9bi7lfqb1.png?width=1006&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ed8e60efc8f10a8f9bf7a4c01fd257a5510c880

As for market cap, UBS is [the 18th largest bank by market cap in the world](https://companiesmarketcap.com/banks/largest-banks-by-market-cap/). Only a handful of banks around the world are larger than UBS, and half of those are Chinese banks (I highly doubt China would be interested in bailing out UBS).

There's only a few U.S banks that ""could"" have the potential of absorbing UBS, but there's 2 main problems with that:

1. Any bank that absorbs UBS would be signing a death warrant on their own company. Unless there's serious pressure from the federal government to absorb UBS (which wouldn't likely happen in the U.S since it's a foreign bank unlike the case with the Swiss Government forcing their own bank \[UBS\] to absorb a smaller one \[Credit Suisse\]), I find it hard to see a bank doing that.
2. In the U.S, it could be a violation of the Antitrust Laws ([the Clayton Act, in particular](https://www.justice.gov/atr/antitrust-laws-and-you#:~:text=This%20law%20prohibits%20mergers%20or,that%20they%20intend%20to%20transact)), which prevents gigantic firms from merging to the point where they're exceeding a certain size. Considering UBS' extremely significant aum, I don't see the federal government (FTC or DOJ) allowing a merger of this size.

Therefore, I'd see the collapse and default of UBS as the end of the can kick and the beginning of the market crash, if something earlier does not already trigger the market crash.

The UBS default would trigger liquidating the mountains of GME shorts that were carried by Credit Suisse, initiating MOASS, in addition to crashing the market. A market crash begets MOASS, and MOASS would beget a market crash. Whichever way you look at it, whichever happens first, once UBS defaults, the market will crash, and GME will put the Volkswagen Squeeze of 2008 to shame.

I'll leave you with this. This was last month:

https://preview.redd.it/geos2tc9lfqb1.png?width=541&format=png&auto=webp&s=af724437aff8a81380e32114205f36b3f7426ebd

I would like to point out that the $1.6 B bet is the notional value (total underlying value of the position, rather than the price of the security). Nonetheless, it's a substantial bet from his firm against the market.

[You can take a look at the 13-F for yourself.](https://13f.info/13f/000090514823000689-scion-asset-management-llc-q2-2023)

Furthermore, it's important to note that funds are only required to report long positions, in addition to their put & call options, ADRs, and convertible notes. Funds are **not** required to disclose short positions on the 13-F. The SEC specifically says on [""Question 41"" of their FAQs](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/13ffaq#:~:text=Q%3A%20What%20about%20short%20positions,report%20only%20the%20long%20position), ""you should not include short positions on Form 13-F. You also should not subtract your short position(s) in a security from your long position(s) in that same security; report only the long position.""

That being said, there could be even more bets against the market going on from Burry (besides the puts) that we're not seeing on the 13-F.

Anyways, Burry doesn't fuck around. He sees the writing on the wall, and I do, too. A storm is coming, Apes, and I'm preparing for it by DRS'ing what I can.

See y'all on the moon 🦍🚀🌚

# The Money Illusion

[In 2008](https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/11/debt-in-the-30s/), we were at the end of a major debt supercycle. The frenzied mortgage lending and securitization in the financial sector, along with massive consumer credit borrowing, had set the U.S. up for a major crisis. In relative terms, we were at a 27% HIGHER total debt to GDP ratio than the Great Depression.

These massive debt loads were coming home to roost, manifesting first as a crisis in subprime but then quickly moving to prime mortgages, corporate debt markets, money markets, and even the consumer credit markets. As discussed in Part 2, NY Fed Pres Tim Geitner stated that during the darkest days of 2008 the inter-bank lending market was freezing up, and we were “[days away from the ATMs not working](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QozGSS7QY_U)”.

&#x200B;

[Total US \(Public+Private\) Debt to GDP](https://preview.redd.it/rfxp8w0v18a71.png?width=482&format=png&auto=webp&s=bdd16cb4fcc7a4d1fd966a5be51e838a07dc2edd)

&#x200B;

But, this didn’t happen. Ben Bernanke, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, was a self avowed student of the Great Depression- and was determined not to let it happen again. He, along with Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson (Former CEO of Goldman Sachs) and Tim Geitner, created new lending facilities and MBS purchase programs in order to swallow the massive amounts of toxic assets the system had created.

Paulson and Bernanke technically had no legal authority to create these programs, but in a crisis, all caution goes out the window. [TARP](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/troubled-asset-relief-program-tarp.asp) and other programs authorized by the Treasury bought billions of dollars of MBS, funded by T-bond issuances. This chart shows [US Govt Debt as a % of GDP through today](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GFDEGDQ188S): (notice the spike in debt during and after 2008)

**The US borrowed heavily- TARP alone was authorized for $700 billion. The Treasury did not have the funds to support this so it issued billions of dollars of T-Bonds.** Banks, hedge funds, other governments, and the Fed all bought these bonds en masse.

**Remember, only the Treasury has the ability to SPEND, and only the Fed has the ability to LEND/PRINT.** The Fed was created as a private institution to “protect” the government from reckless money-printing. The [Primary Dealers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/primarydealer.asp) (banks approved to trade directly with the Govt) buy Govt bonds from the US Treasury, and turn around and sell these bonds to the Fed or other third parties. If you’re confused about how the system works, I recommend watching [this video on how the financial system functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFDe5kUUyT0&list=PLF_lD6tTQahfNDvjbfl2OJQWxHBSDYUcA&index=7).

In the equity markets, as we started bottoming in the first quarter of 2009, hedge funds, banks, and family offices began loading up on margin debt again. This renewed confidence in the banking system and overall lending capacity began [pushing equity markets](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/2021/06/16/margin-debt-and-the-market-up-1-7-in-may-continues-record-trend) back up.

Further stabilizing the markets was the Federal Reserve with their massive Quantitative Easing program. In 2008, the [Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet ballooned](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WALCL)\- assets (Treasuries and MBS) grew from $880 Billion pre-crisis, to $2 Trillion immediately after, and eventually over $4T by 2014. Many economists, particularly those with a libertarian bent, such as Peter Schiff, immediately decried this reckless behavior and predicted immediate hyper-inflation as early as 2011.

[Federal Reserve Balance Sheet](https://preview.redd.it/c3xymxf228a71.png?width=617&format=png&auto=webp&s=6022846b09f94c79188be23c66859b95a342063b)

When the Fed buys assets, it is completely different from any other institution buying. Pension plans or mutual funds use the savings of the investors of the fund. **Because that money came either from working, or from other investments, it represents NO net increase in money supply.** The money they received HAD to come from someone else, for a good/product/service/asset they created or provided.

However, the Fed has no taxing authority, no savings, no funds to speak of at all- **EVERYTHING the Fed buys it purchases through money it PRINTS**. **Thus, Fed Balance Sheet expansion=money printing. The Fed printed $2T in the two years following 2008.**

**This rampant money printing rightly worried experts and pundits in the media- but the inflation they feared never came. They were flat out WRONG. Why?**

**Most of the new money that was printed went directly into the banking system**. Lyn Alden describes it brilliantly-

“Leading into the financial crisis, only about 13% of bank reserve assets consisted of cash (3%) and Treasury securities (10%). The rest of their assets were invested in loans and riskier securities. This was also at a time when household debt to GDP reached a record high, as consumers were caught up in the housing bubble.

That over-leveraged bank situation hit a climax into the 2008/2009 crisis, coinciding with record high debt-to-GDP among households, and was the apex of the long-term private (non-federal) debt cycle. **When banks are that leveraged with very little cash reserves, even a 3% loss in assets results in insolvency.** And that’s what happened; the banking system as a whole hit a peak total loan charge-off rate of over 3%, and it resulted in a widespread banking crisis” (I can't link source, it keeps getting the post taken down- I will post it in comments).

[Bank Recapitalization](https://preview.redd.it/h2e3zan728a71.png?width=621&format=png&auto=webp&s=21227fa9075245823c0e463a9626cf0bd5ba924e)

**Thus, the new money went to recapitalize banks and shore up their balance sheets to defend them from bankruptcy- it stayed in untouchable bank reserves, and never entered circulation.**

The money that didn’t go to repair bank balance sheets flowed directly into the markets - Let’s walk through it.

There are two different economies-[ the real economy, and the financial economy. ](https://www.mdpi.com/1911-8074/14/3/129/htm)**The tidal wave of new money the Fed was creating did not cause inflation (in the traditional sense), because the money did not flow into the real economy- the goods, products and services that everyone consumes on a daily basis.** The money instead flowed into the Financial economy- bond markets, stock markets, private equity funds, commodities, Forex markets, etc.

[Financial Economy vs Real Economy](https://preview.redd.it/b8v6b23a28a71.png?width=635&format=png&auto=webp&s=60f2d1ae42bdad9f98b92f03ebe1b7903c879b88)

When you give a bank $100M, it doesn't go out and buy $100M worth of Big Macs and Kleenex- the bank puts these funds into investments, generally either in the form of loans or in the form of equities or equity derivatives. Thus, the funds that flowed into the banks are stored up almost exclusively in the financial system, or get pushed into loans to consumers.

“Wait a second!”- you say. “The Fed printed money to buy T-Bonds- The Treasury usually spends funds that go into the real economy-- so THAT should have caused inflation, right?”

Yes, this is typically what happens. **But, during and after the 2008 financial crisis the majority of Treasury expenditures went to programs that were stabilizing the financial system (TARP+ TAF+ TLGP+ Others). So, the money that would have been spent by govt agencies in the real economy** [**instead just flowed back to banks and financial institutions**](https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/regional-economist/january-2011/a-closer-look-brassistance-programs-in-the-wake-of-the-crisis)**.**

Typically in a recession the Treasury will increase spending to cushion the blow to workers- and in 2009 they did extend a few unemployment benefits. But, by and large, Congress authorized few benefit programs for workers, and the [average time on the benefit decreased after a slight bump in 2009](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/21/business/economy/unemployment-insurance.html).

[Average Time on Benefit](https://preview.redd.it/345yskvc28a71.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=09c1baf172e55f5753b5542006f970280e3a7725)

Thus, the amount of freshly-printed money that reached the real economy was minimal, and whatever money did reach it largely acted to counteract deflationary forces- it wasn’t enough to actually induce inflation. The government did little to stop foreclosures, or provide aid to small businesses. [Unemployment spiked](https://www.macrotrends.net/1377/u6-unemployment-rate), and due to the [Phillips Curve Principle](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-economics/chapter/the-relationship-between-inflation-and-unemployment/#:~:text=The%20Phillips%20curve%20shows%20the%20relationship%20between%20inflation%20and%20unemployment,run%20Phillips%20curve%20was%20stable.) (covered in Pt 1), this put a dampening effect on inflation.

[Unemployment Rates](https://preview.redd.it/9dxis4se28a71.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9a66852c917d5a025c00f46900e4d16a4a180c4)

The funds the Federal Reserve had created, therefore, created no inflation in the real economy- instead they [flowed to the financial economy](https://twitter.com/Mayhem4Markets/status/1411139236435275779?s=20) and inflated financial assets. This started off the [largest and longest bull market run in U.S. Stock market history](https://www.investopedia.com/market-milestones-as-the-bull-market-turns-10-4588903)\- easily beating emerging and other developed countries’ equity markets.

[Massive US Stock Market Rally](https://preview.redd.it/mpg5b29h28a71.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f5621475cd0ecbd06d8897592ca085854683fc1)

[Keynesian economists](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/keynesianeconomics.asp#:~:text=Keynesian%20economics%20is%20a%20macroeconomic,output%2C%20employment%2C%20and%20inflation.&text=Based%20on%20his%20theory%2C%20Keynes,economy%20out%20of%20the%20depression.) lauded this as an accomplishment- **they believed they were creating what is called a “**[**Wealth Effect**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wealtheffect.asp)**” - a theory that stated that as people’s financial wealth increased, they would be induced to do more spending and investment- thus, by propping up the stock market, they would stimulate the real economy. This is awfully convenient for the rich-** [**the top 10% own 85% of the equity markets,**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/27/wealth-gap-grows-as-rising-corporate-profits-boost-stock-holdings-controlled-by-richest-households.html) **and thus have seen their wealth balloon by over 186% while growth for everyone else stagnated.**

Ironically this theory has it exactly backwards- real economic growth should drive the stock market, not the other way around. But, convinced of their theories, economic policymakers continued to pump ever increasing sums into the financial system.

**When you divide stock market performance by the Fed’s Balance sheet, you see that there has been basically NO real growth since 2008.**

&#x200B;

[The Rally is an Illusion](https://preview.redd.it/7locky7n28a71.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c21adbd363d10699e28ae34f0d4dc4b09a9e777)

**The entire “rally” we have experienced for the past 12 years has been nothing but an illusion- it is simply the result of vast money inflows into the financial system.** Banks and financial institutions will do everything they can to convince you that the high stock market valuations are justified by fundamental growth.

This is wrong- these valuations are NOT justified. Insane levels of money printing and debt leverage have created extremely dislocated equity markets. For example, [Square (SQ)](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/sq) has a forward [PE ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp) of 499.87- it currently doesn't pay a dividend, but let’s assume it paid a 3% [dividend payout ratio ](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividendpayoutratio.asp)(which is rare for tech stocks) - **if that were the case, it would take 14,996 YEARS for the dividends to pay pack the price of ONE SHARE. (449.87/0.03).**

To summarize, see [this image](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/njmqe2/were_approaching_the_endgame/) from a post I made a month back- **all the warning lights are blinking red. The markets are at the extreme end of the range by almost every valuation metric- and no one seems to care.**

[Summary of Recent Warnings](https://preview.redd.it/vpw34xbs28a71.png?width=409&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ed5bd8caef1db4d622b2b3532425d130cfb5575)

The markets are slowly being “walked up” every day. Today, the **ultimate price insensitive buyer (the Fed)** is now plowing $120B a month into Treasuries and MBS, and the Primary Dealers now have to turn around and put their money somewhere. **The bond market is already a trap with 2% yields, and 5% inflation. There’s no more profit potential there, so these institutions are forced to buy equities if they want any returns.** [**The Fed is killing whatever is left of price discovery.**](https://twitter.com/NorthmanTrader/status/1410296365012459521?s=20)

Four billion dollars or so a day is being pumped into the system- and going straight to the stock markets.

Further, to stimulate growth in the real economy, [policymakers dropped interest rates to near 0% in late 2008 ](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/EFFR)to induce bank lending to get consumers to borrow and spend again. ([70% of our economy is consumption](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DPCERE1Q156NBEA) due to the factors discussed in Part 1).

This did create massive loan demand- basically every sector of the US economy began borrowing en masse. The Fed was able to “reflate” the bubble and allow the economy to survive on debt financing to “re-invigorate the economy”. **Fast-forward to today, and a decade of pinning rates to the zero-bound has us breaking records in terms of debt loads:**

I could go on and on, but you get the point. Now, the entire system is overleveraged- the cancer has spread, and it has infected virtually every single sector of the economy.

**People keep saying that we “kicked the can” of 2008 down the road. This is WRONG. We kicked the can UP THE STAIRS- meaning, we not only delayed the problem, but made sure it would get WORSE, since we borrowed MORE to paper over the old debts and worthless securities the system had created.**

**A fascinating aspect of our recent financial history is that** [**the bailouts are exponentially growing**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT1WqIkg9es&t=56s)**- this is due to the simple fact that the entity giving the bailout has to have a balance sheet multiples larger than the firm receiving the bailout, and government guarantees of banks induce reckless speculation.** For example, to bailout a bank with $10B in mark-to-market losses, you need a bank with a $20 or $30B capital surplus, to absorb the loss and keep the depositors and creditors satisfied that the bank giving the bailout won’t go under.

In [1998, a hedge fund called LTCM ](https://www.thebalance.com/long-term-capital-crisis-3306240)was near collapse- [it had leveraged itself over 25-1](https://sites.duke.edu/djepapers/files/2016/08/prabhu.pdf), using complex algorithms made by Nobel Prize winning economists to predict bond prices. They had made massive derivative bets buying Russian bonds (among other things) - and when the Russian government defaulted in August 1998, their positions began to unravel.

The massive debt and derivative exposure they had created was threatening to pull several large banks down with it. The Fed stepped in during September to organize a $3.5 Billion bailout, funded by 12 large banks. **According to James Rickards, General Counsel of the LTCM Bailout- the US equity and bond markets were “**[**close to being completely shut down**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4_1pwsm5LY&list=PLE88E9ICdiphYjJkeeLL2O09eJoC8r7Dc&index=8)**” during the worst of that crisis. (start at 16:30)**

In 2008, the entire US financial system was nearing collapse and desperately needed a bailout. A massive bank run had begun. Congress stepped up and provided- in the end spending over [$498 Billion of taxpayer funds](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/heres-how-much-2008-bailouts-really-cost). However, the Fed also provided a bailout (though QE), eventually [buying over $1.7 Trillion of MBS](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WSHOMCB).

Since the Great Financial Crisis, the banking system debt crisis has now become a government debt crisis, and indeed an economic debt crisis- **and this debt has spread worldwide.** Equity and bond markets have continued to march up, despite fundamentals. This new financial paradigm was rightly termed “[The Everything Bubble](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0794RLM8R/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)”

[Total World Debt](https://preview.redd.it/b01f8f4638a71.png?width=601&format=png&auto=webp&s=d91ead1be1711bb17666e242bde41e1b9d0fbc5f)

[**Total (Govt+Private) Global Debt**](https://www.axios.com/global-debt-gdp-898959ed-f96a-4c4d-85a3-5d3cc419631f.html) **now stands at staggering $281 Trillion, or 356% of GDP.** We’ve never been here before- we are now navigating uncharted waters. The next bailout will have to be bigger- a LOT bigger.

# Avalanches

[Avalanche](https://preview.redd.it/mglsuam938a71.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=21330913e64427c381233b2f82f3f285d99f0610)

Imagine a snowfield on an alpine slope, above a small town. A few inches of snow falls. Everything is fine. More snow falls. Still nothing happens. A blizzard moves in. A day later, the snowfield reaches critical mass. Then, a disturbance happens- it could be a deer foraging for food, or a hapless skier exploring the backcountry. The snow starts sliding, pushing the snow below it. Positive feedback loops start to engage. **The field begins to slide- now an avalanche has begun. The town is wiped out.**

The financial crisis was the beginning of a debt avalanche- it’s likely that over 70% of the major banks, mortgage brokers, and other financial institutions would have gone bankrupt, superseding the Great Depression-era record of 30%. Thousands of private and public companies would have gone bankrupt. Real estate and equity markets would have entered a freefall lasting for years, and unemployment would likely have spiked past 30%, bringing back the soup lines not seen since 1936.

Instead, policymakers kicked the can up the stairs- they issued massive amounts of government debt to paper over the 2008 crisis, and incentivized excessive borrowing in the private sector. The fundamental factors that caused the crisis (unregulated derivatives, bank combinations, excessive leverage, lack of oversight) were never resolved. **As** [u/Criand](https://www.reddit.com/u/Criand/) **so elegantly puts it, 2008 never ended. Now, with**[ **US Government Debt standing at over $28 Trillion**](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GFDEBTN)**, there are only tough choices ahead. We will soon reach a point where the interest payments alone on the debt supersede all US Tax Revenues- when that happens, we will have traveled beyond the event horizon-** [**there will be no coming back**](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/56598)**. The debt will be IMPOSSIBLE to pay off.** (This is according to the governments own projections!)**📷**

**The US Government continues to borrow- running a staggering**[ **$2.1 Trillion deficits for just the first half of 2021**](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/deficit-tracker/)**. There is no end in sight. The Biden Administration is pushing for another $**[**1.2 Trillion in infrastructure spending**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/24/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-support-for-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-framework/) **this year ON TOP of the already massive deficits. Some politicians are demanding that it be more.**

**Day by day, we are adding snow to the mountains above our village. When will end is anyone’s guess, but borrowing more will only make the end worse.**

# Smoothbrain Overview:

* Through the magic of Fractional Reserve banking, institutions can loan out much more debt than cash that actually exists. This increases systemic risk.
* As a result, over 90% of all capital created is in the form of debt. This supercharges debt cycles and can cause massive bank failures.
* When debt super-cycles crest, and begin the march downwards, massive deleveraging and defaults begin. If the banking system is weak, bank runs begin. (1930s)
* We were hitting another end of the 80 yr debt cycle in 2008 (1929-2008 (79yrs)). We never de-leveraged the system. **Instead, we re-leveraged EVERYTHING even MORE.**
* The Government and the Fed swept in and bailed out the banks. Now the Federal Government is deeply in debt to the[ tune of $28 Trillion](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GFDEBTN).
* **The trillions printed by the Fed were almost exclusively routed to the financial system- creating a new bubble in every single asset class,** larger and even more widespread than the 2008 bubble.
* **We never resolved 2008. We only kicked the can up the stairs.** The Derivatives monster from Pt 2, along with a massive debt avalanche, will come back with a vengeance.
* Almost every sector of the US economy, and indeed the world economy, is now greatly overleveraged. **Global Total Debt to GDP broke past 350% during Covid**.
* Options are running out for policymakers. Debt borrowing and money-printing cannot continue forever.

# Conclusion:

**The debt crisis will return, but this time, it will be the financial system, US government, and indeed the ENTIRE world economy that needs a bailout- and who has a big enough balance sheet to absorb that? The only answer is the ones with an infinite balance sheet- the Central Banks.**

The idea that anyone can borrow forever, or print money forever, with no consequences, defies basic financial logic. **Impossible Objects cannot exist forever.** History shows deadly consequences for the nations that venture down either path. The United States is no exception.

**The Fed has already tried to escape this trap in 2018. It failed. Sovereign creditors are losing faith in the US Treasury, and have been since 2015. The walls are closing in, and the ultimate decision must be made. (More on this in Pt 4)**

**The avalanche is coming either way- and we only have two choices. Either we allow ourselves to be buried under a mountain of hyper-deflation, creating a new Great Depression, frozen credit and equity markets, and massive bank failures- or, we burn our way out, using the inferno of money-printing and hyper-inflation.**

"EM says I don't need a car, even though I'm an essential worker. (Then tries to steal it)","Hey again guys, I'm sorry if this seems like a long rant. But I'm so furious right now, I need to get this off my chest.

A little backstory: Right now, I am a student in college pursuing a degree in child developmental psychotherapy. This semester, I got an internship at a local mental hospital so I could get experience, and make it easier for me to get into grad school later on. The hospital I work at, isn't just a facility for short term patients though.  Some of the people who live there are permanent residents, ranging in age from 6-78 (For various reasons; but I won't name specifics, out of respect for our residents' privacy)  Basically, our goal is to do everything possible to help people recover from a mental illness/episode and to provide a comfortable quality of life for our permanent residents. Needless to say, I deeply enjoyed my internship there. After the initial COVID-19 outbreak, all internships within the hospital were suspended until further notice, So I stopped going for a good 3 weeks and tried to focus on school. Then one of my old bosses called me, in tears, filling me in on the current state of the hospital. There had been 3 positive cases of COVID-19, out of which 2 had passed away. 12 employees had quit (or simply not come into work at all anymore) And to top it all off, there was a surge in people admitting themselves or others to the facility. *A good chun*k *of people admitted were children*, *whose parent's claimed they* *had some form of mental defect (although I suspect that they simply didn't know what to do with them*) Once she had finished telling me about the situation, I immediately begged her to put me on the next work schedule. She agreed, and I've been working there ever since. Now, I don't want to come across as arrogant or pretending to be a martyr or anything like that. In all honesty, I think I am VERY underqualified compared to someone with actual medical experience/training. But, I know is that these people at this hospital are dependent on us for care, support, love, and help. And I will be god damned if I just sit by and watch bad things happen to these people. Simple as that.

Sorry long backstory! Onto the actual story: 

Ever since I started working at the hospital, my hours have been absolutely insane. There have been times where I have spent 48-50 hours straight at the building. I eat when I can, I sleep at 3 hour intervals, (so I can get up in the middle of the night and check on our residents and patients), I do my virtual lectures and homework while organizing patient files. (As awful, and maybe selfish, as this sounds, I do try to get on my switch around midnight and take care of my Animal Crossing Town. I'm weak!) Basically, I'm lucky if I'm able to spend 30 hours at my home. That's where our entitled mother (EM) comes into the picture. If you have read the edit on my last EM post (Yes it IS the same woman!!) you already know this, but if you didn't, basically she got arrested for drug possession and subsequently lost custody of her son. Ever since, she has been absolutely DESPERATE to get custody of him again. So, she has been scrambling between family members, trying to acquire things that make her look like a responsible parent. Baby gates, child safety locks, a new fridge, a new bed, countless new toys, I could go on and on. However, She went to her dad (My stepdad) for the most expensive thing she needed; a car. My stepdad refused, because he was recently laid off because of the pandemic and we can't really afford to be buying something so expensive and not even be able to use it. ( I've been giving a portion of my paychecks to my parents to help ease the burden; it's not much in the grand scheme of things, but it's enough. I don't think we're in trouble financially, but if worst came to worst, I would start giving 100% of my paycheck to them) After this conversation, EM drove to our house. Yes, drove...she HAD a car. And tried to plead her case with my Stepdad again. I was sleeping in my room at this point, but my Stepdad told me about the conversation and it basically went like this:

EM: ""Dad, PLEASE, I wouldn't be asking if it wasn't important""

Stepdad: ""You already have a car though""

EM: ""Yeah, but's it's not an awesome car, I need one with heated seats and built in GPS""

Stepdad: ""I don't think a judge would really care what kind of car you have, as long as it's a CAR""

EM: ""You are so selfish! I NEED this so I can get my son back and you aren't even willing to help! How could you let my baby be taken away, without helping me get him back! Don't you think YOUR grandson deserves something nice after what he's been through!!""

Stepdad: ""I can't afford it! I'm sorry, even if I wanted to, I can't do anything""

EM: ""then let me have OP's car""

Stepdad: ""OP needs that car to go to work, she's an essential worker""

EM: ""That's debatable, making sure some pyscho doesn't off themselves isn't really 'essential', I bet she doesn't even do anything anyways. She's probably just lying about the job so she can go get high or fuck some dude. Dad I am your DAUGHTER, She is nothing but some half-breed (I'm mixed race) bitch. Just give me the car""

Stepdad: ""The answer is No. Get out. Figure this shit out yourself. I'm not helping you""

I thought the situation was over after that conversation....NOPE!

I don't know how she did it, but EM got my work's address and went there while I was working. I was on hour 5 of a 18 hour shift, when my boss took my aside and told me that my car had been vandalized and she had called the police. When I went to look outside, I saw EM handcuffed and arguing with a police officer in front of my car. Apparently, she had tried to steal my car, by breaking the driver side window and attempting to hotwire my car. When she couldn't hot wire my car, she got out, broke one of my tail lights, then keyed a word that I morally REFUSE to even type on my driver side door. As pathetic as this sounds, I started sobbing as soon as I saw the damage. Maybe it was the lack of sleep catching up to me, maybe it was the shock, all I know is that I was gross crying in front of my boss, EM, and the police. EM was yelling things at me, but I couldn't tell you what they were if I tried. I just went into auto pilot. I gave my statement to police, confirmed that I wanted to press charges, called a tow for my poor car and took an uber home. I honestly hope that was the end of her bullshit for a least a while, because I don't think I can handle anymore of her...everything right now. I fixed my car, as much as I could on my budget. I had an extra tail light, so I put it in. I put a trash bag over the broken window and I used duct tape to cover up the....word....she keyed into my door. Sure, it looks super ugly, but it still runs. I'm just thankful that she didn't cut anything important. The ironic thing is, my stepdad's family is talking about pooling money together so they can get me a new car. When my stepdad asked me if I had any preferences, I told him I wanted heated seats and a built in GPS, oh sweet Karma. Bail hasn't been set yet on EM, but all I know is that after this she is NOT getting her son back. I'm happy for that though, That boy deserves so much more than she could give, and maybe now he will get it. Thanks for listening to my rant you guys. Stay safe out there!

Stuff for new traders (No GME Discussion),"I gotta say, I see some good shit out there. I see new members trying to diversify their positions and learn about other stocks and other ways to make money. This is the path my fellow retards. I'm a nobody here, but I have good returns and some good insight. When I came to WSB, multiple people helped me figure out what the fuck I was doing, because I knew jack shit. I care more about my money than yours, but no retard should be left in the dark alone. So let me pass on a couple things. I can't prove shit to you, so read this or don't.

I mainly trade options (Calls and Puts), so that is what I will discuss

Generally the most insane gains will come from being in a specific stock and not an ETF or Index. While riskier, this is where you can hit the homeruns. So decide if you want to go for conservative gains or if you want those huge swings. While what I said is true, I am usually against putting everything into a single bet. Anything can go wrong at any time and no play is 100% guaranteed. The goal of this game is to stay alive. You will lose money on a play at some point, because it is inevitable. So never let yourself get wiped out, because you can always build yourself back up. This goes along with one of my other recommendations: always have SOME cash ready to go. You never know when there might be an incredible opportunity and you do not want to get caught with your ass hanging out.

Paper hands and diamond hands are just words. You ultimately decide when you want to sell or hold and how much profit you want to take. One of my favorite strategies is to say, buy an even number of options on a play, sell half at a modest level of gains (like enough to break even or gain a little bit) and then let the rest ride longer. Look guys, on many plays, you either paper hands at some point or diamond hands long enough to see your positions go red. Some people will bail at 40% gains and others might not take anything less than 500%. Just know that chasing endless profits ups the risk factor, so YOU decide when it's time. Having a target share price for the stock is also a good strategy.

Here's a couple psychological principles in investing. Studies have found that people tend to hold onto losing positions too long and sell winning positions too early. They let their losers lose and cut off their winners short. Apparently most people hate losing more than they like winning. Think about this before you sell. Stocks can often get hot and run multiple days in a row. Sometimes a stock will have one red day and then keep up going. This is why it's important to know WHY you got into a position. Trust your DD and stick to the plan. I had ideas for plays where they went red right away and I bailed... only to see them moon. ""Diamond Hands"" means that you don't dump your position instantly if it goes down. The hardest thing is knowing if you should cut losses or diamond hands. I'm a retard and we're in a bull market.. so often times the stock will eventually go up. Your call though.

The market makers and big boys want you to lose. They want your money. I'm not going to dive into the realm of possible illegal activities that they may use, but just point out some simpler tactics they will use. Big money often sees retail as ""weak hands"" aka Buy High and Sell Low. They know FOMO is strong when a stock is going up big and that fear takes over when a stock divebombs. We're in a bull market, which means stonks only go up. However, we still have negative days. Stocks sell off sometimes and things can look bad. Generally, the dip is not time to sell, but instead, time to buy. Case and point, we had a pretty big drilling 2 weeks ago. Do you know what the big money did? They bought the fuckin dip and snatched up everything for cheap. We've been mooning ever since.

Sometimes shit makes no sense. A company can have blowout earnings, exceed expectations, and the stock will tank. I was holding one stock a little while ago that reported a fantastic earnings and proceeded to drill to the core of the Earth that day. It was total bullshit and I knew it, I trusted my DD. So instead of panic selling, I added to my position. Sure enough, the stock began swinging upwards and hit an all-time high just 2 weeks later. This is why simply gambling can bite you in the ass. It's easy to get scared and sell when you doubt yourself because you picked a random thing to buy.

Option Expiration Dates matter. Buying a 1 week option is the cheapest and gives the biggest percentage of profits if it goes your way. However, it can often be a noob trap. One bad day or one piece of bad news can kill your entire position. Stocks trade sideways sometimes. Sometimes they don't do what you think they should do. And sometimes the whole fucking market shits itself for seemingly no reason. So give yourself TIME to work with. Time costs money and hurts profit margins. But it is better to consistently make 50% profit than to hit one play for 300% followed by 10 losers. Look, playing weekly stupidly OTM calls is fun as hell and is a huge rush when it hits. I do at least one or more every week. The key is not loading your entire portfolio into this shit. Remember, no tendies = no more fun.

Along the same lines, Strike Price matters. An OTM (Out of the Money) option means that the Strike Price is a bit of a ways from where the stock's price currently is. OTM options give huge profit margins the further you go out. I personally enjoy using them.. some people don't. But my advice is to balance risk with profit potential. If your call relies on a stock gaining 50% in 2 weeks.. then well, it's probably not gonna happen. ITM (In The Money) options means that your stock is already within the strike price. ITM is a more conservative play and sacrifices massive gains for lower risk.

[https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html) \- Use this to get an estimate of potential profits and how much of a move you need

Leaps are fuckin dope. A Leap is a call, but for a much longer period of time. I'm using the term loosely because we're degenerates and some people might consider anything more than 1 month a leap. Given that the market trends up over time, you might even make some money on a mediocre stock this way. A lot of people buy ITM leaps, but again, I'm a degenerate and go OTM a lot.

Implied Volatility (IV) - Extremely fucking important. IV is basically an estimation of how much a stock is predicted to move in either direction. High IV = Expensive Options. It's fucking weird to think, but you can make similar profits from a 2% move on a low IV stock as you can from a 5% move on a more volatile stock. Low IV is fantastic when buying an option on a stock that you think is about to moon. High IV is riskier, so you damn well better think the stock can make some big moves. Buying an option on a stock right before Earnings Report (ER) will be more expensive due to IV. Trying to play ER is usually for suckers, unless you have some really good DD about why a company might deliver a huge surprise. One of the textbook big boy moves is to pump a stock going into ER. The company will deliver great news and then dump hard. You may see people bitching about this very soon. Basically, big money knew ahead of time it would be good, so the stock got pumped and then they took profits.

Buy the rumor and sell the news. Events, press releases, and important dates that everyone knows about are another trap. You will get shit on. Ask someone about TESLA Battery Day. Positive rumors will send a stock soaring though.

Finally, get busy learning. Read about Options on Investopedia and any other things you do not understand. The big boys rely on us to not know what the fuck we're doing to take our money. Learn about the general market. Stocks are grouped into ""Sectors"" or categories. Start figuring out what they are and pay attention to where the money is going. I didn't even mention half of the shit that goes on in options, so that's on you. The first thing you need to do is to learn what the ""Greeks"" are. That will teach you how options function.

If anyone wants to talk or discuss, send me a message. I'm a degenerate with no life.

Oh and, if you follow someone's DD and lose money that's on you. I've come up with some genius shit, but I've also lost on some retarded calls. Nobody can pick you a guaranteed winner and hindsight is 20/20.

First off, if you are long GME this is not a post to tell you to sell GME.

GME sequence of events (yes the game was rigged we retail traders got screwed):

GME is way over shorted > brokers allowed this > squeeze happens, hedge fund lose tons of money and face insolvency > Citadel gives $3 billion to Melvin Capital, despite the fact they are supposed to be a neutral market maker > price keeps surging > Melvin faces insolvency and will lose Citadel's investment, Citadel is no longer a neutral player > clearinghouses get leaned on by powerful suits to raise margin requirements on GME > brokers will have to make up the losses of the shorts they allowed to occur > they decide to save their own skin at the expense of their clients and rig the trade > instead of going to thousands per share as IBKR ceo admitted it would have, retail is robbed of billions in gains

**Now on to the silver post**

This is a very long post, so I apologize to the WSB apes who can barely read and will have to scroll a long way to get to the TLDR. Its also been impossible to post about silver lately on WSB (no posts approved, thanks to the mod who assisted this one), so I crammed about 3-4 posts worth into this one.  Not sure when I'll be allowed to post again.

I've organized this post into 4 sections so feel free to skip around to the parts you are interested in.

1. The silver short squeeze evidence
2. Why the 'hedge funds are pushing silver' narrative is BS
3. The fundamental case for silver, and why the shorts deserve to be squeezed
4. TLDR, what to buy if you want to go long silver

Since my [initial post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6novm/the_real_dd_on_slv_the_worlds_biggest_short/) on the potential for a silver short squeeze, I have been researching the topic to prepare a more detailed and substantiated update post.  This is my latest attempt to post, and hopefully this one gets to stay up (silver censorship has been a thing here lately)

**1.  The potential for a short squeeze (573% of the 'float' is currently sold short)**

The big thing to remember here is that if enough market participants who are long silver contracts in the futures market begin to demand delivery of their silver, there will absolutely be a meltup in the price  because there simply isn't enough supply available.

**The next 3 trading days are critical, and there is war being waged.  The shorts and COMEX are in a fight for their lives, and barely hanging on by a thread**

Many big name precious metals veterans have bemoaned for years about how the size of the 'paper' silver market absolutely dwarfs the amount of silver that could be delivered, and thus the market is manipulated.  The vast majority of futures and options contracts in the silver market have historically been settled via cash.  Meaning no physical silver is actually delivered when these contracts are set to expire. This is where the talk of the 100-1 and 250-1 paper silver to physical silver ratios comes from, but short interest is actually more like 6-1 on the COMEX using open interest data through the next two big delivery months.

Technically every month is eligible for deliveries, but only months with options interest tend to have any real volume, and that's why they are known as delivery months.  March and May are options expiration months, while April is not.

If you want to think about it like a stock, **the short interest is 573% of the 'float'**.  This is based on the fact that over the next 3 months there are futures contracts and options which have the right to take delivery of 847 million ounces of silver.  This is compared to only 147 million ounces registered on the COMEX that could fulfil these deliveries.  For perspective, GME short interest peaked at around 140% of its float, and that was considered crazy high.  It is widely known that if a small, but significant share of long silver contract holders took delivery, that there would not be enough silver, as the demand would cascade higher and higher as the prices rise.

(sources: [silver stocks report](https://www.cmegroup.com/delivery_reports/Silver_stocks.xls),  [futures open interest](https://www.cmegroup.com/market-data/volume-open-interest/metals-volume.html), [options open interest](https://www.cmegroup.com/tools-information/quikstrike/open-interest-heatmap.html), data as of 2-18 was used in this post)

This would be similar to a bank run scenario.  The COMEX is the silver bank, and they have printed too many paper claims on a limited amount of silver.  If there is no actual silver left to be delivered to the holders of the futures contracts, that means that means that the COMEX would default and settle their contracts in cash.  No one wants to get settled in cash if the COMEX had to default.  This would mean that right as you want to be able to stay long silver, as the price is surging higher, that you will get forced out and paid cash instead of silver and wouldn't benefit from future increases in the price.  The traders who want to stay long silver and who see the run occurring would try to take delivery because if you actually have physical silver in your vault then it doesn't matter if the COMEX goes down, you still have your actual silver you can sell on the spot market.  Most importantly to them, they get to keep participating in the upside.

Now the shorts are very much trying to keep the price down at the moment, because their problems get worse as the price rises and more options become in the money.  See the chart below, with a handy arrow to illustrate where we are currently in terms of March open interest.

https://preview.redd.it/y6j90g954mi61.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2ad9f33ea4008e3380ce11eb4e9333669e1524e

As the price rises more and more, the short interest grows as more options on futures contracts become 'in the money', compounding problems for the shorts. This is the silver version of a gamma squeeze.

The chart below shows the number of ounces that would be eligible for delivery over the next 3 months, given the current open interest data.  Most of the open interest comes from futures contracts that aren't dependent on price, but I've made this chart to illustrate how the problems get worse for the shorts due to the options contracts as the price rises.  The latest silver price as I'm writing this is $27.37.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t91qm4t84mi61.png?width=664&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fee997ca32e24a60916e6829be375885263107c

But why would contract holders all of a sudden start to demand delivery when cash settlement has historically been the norm?  A couple of reasons.

The first reason is arbitrage.  Premiums on 1000oz bars have surged to somewhere between $1 and $2 an ounce (this is unheard of on the 1000oz commercial bars), meaning that traders can stand for delivery and then sell in the physical market for immediate profit.  When supply had become constrained in previous silver bull markets these premiums were more like 30 cents an ounce.

In addition, mints are also interested in arbitrage.  They could begin to take delivery to break down 1000oz commercial bars into smaller units which currently trade at historic premiums of $5-$8 an ounce.  The small unit silver market has experienced greater demand than ever before.  The entire stock of small unit silver was sold out at all dealers a few weeks ago.  The small amounts they do get in stock are only sold at massive premiums.

The second reason traders may take delivery is because they see the massive opportunity presenting itself right now, and they don't want to be cash settled when the COMEX defaults. They see that the squeeze is possible and that they profit massively by simply taking delivery, sitting on their silver while the squeeze happens, and then reselling it at much higher prices.  Early rumblings of massively increased delivery volume is already presenting itself in the data.  See the chart below showing the past 3 months of deliveries compared with the same time period in previous years

&#x200B;

[\*Feb 2021 deliveries are ongoing and will continue to rise](https://preview.redd.it/5last6ye4mi61.png?width=403&format=png&auto=webp&s=98c7a2371c60c258e363183e693b1540647ea00c)

Note that this chart corresponds with December of the previous year through February of the year that is labeled on the x-axis.  So 2016 actually represents December of 2015 through February of 2016.

It seems that the silver futures market is suddenly becoming a place where silver actually gets delivered in meaningful quantities.  This trend is even more pronounced when you look at just the most recent month of February, which like April was not an options expiration month, and thus typically has very low volume.  Even still, the increased interest in taking delivery of silver from the COMEX is very clear.   And historic at that.

&#x200B;

[\*Feb 2021 deliveries are ongoing and will continue to rise](https://preview.redd.it/pk37q11tkmi61.png?width=362&format=png&auto=webp&s=cddd64a50dfc58bf0f5a118951096f7dda5f5c69)

February 2021 has had 9.95 million ounces delivered through 2-18, and there is still 1.83 million ounces in open interest.  Anyone still sitting in a contract this late in the month wants delivery, so we can safely assume Feb. deliveries will end above 11 million, and closer to 12 million.   This is compared with an average of only 2.20 million ounces delivered in the previous 3 Februaries. An increase of roughly 422% (assuming 11.5 million delivered).

March is gearing up to potentially be an earth shattering month for delivery requests that could send silver soaring.  March in the previous 3 years has averaged 26.79 million ounces delivered.  If this year's month of March experienced the same 422% increase in deliveries that occurred in February, that would represent \~140 million ounces delivered.  Enough to completely drain the COMEX registered stocks.  If typical contract roll-forward behavior persists, we are actually on track to hit around that number.  The chart below shows how March is on track to finish the month with between 30-40k contracts demanding delivery (each contract represents 5,000 oz).  Chart is courtesy of  [u/Ditch\_the\_DeepState](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ditch_the_DeepState/) who does an awesome job with these.

&#x200B;

[note this has one more day of data relative to the chart above](https://preview.redd.it/ykkeebqflmi61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=e85eed5a8056ce5025c92cf9fcaf6322ab72a36c)

**\*\*\***

The final day to roll contracts forward to not be eligible for March delivery is Wednesday, February 24th.  Given these are not normal times in terms of deliveries, it would not surprise me to see the decline for OI in March flatten out and stun the world by finishing with 40k contracts awaiting delivery.  The COMEX only has registered stocks to cover 29.4k.

And let's say the COMEX survives March and is able to meet all the delivery requests, this is what the May open interest looks like. Can you imagine the COMEX going into May with only 20 or 30 million registered ounces staring down the barrel of 450+ million ounces of open interest (and this figure will rise once March passes and/or the price rise causes more call options to be ITM).  At this point the long in May would absolutely stand for delivery and hope they are one of the lucky few who aren't force settled in Cash.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m5p95miq4mi61.png?width=861&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4163fc9c08e909d42207c5f2c4727c2ee0938f7

So even if only half or three-fourths of the 147 million available ounces are delivered, the May contract holders will see that the available supply is shrinking fast, creating even more demand for physical delivery because the opportunity is that much more clear for a continued short squeeze.  That and the fact that there are longs who really do want the silver for various reasons, and would be worried that the COMEX will default and there will be no silver available for delivery at all.

This is where critics of the potential for a short squeeze may point out that if the COMEX starts to run out of silver, they will just find more.  This is increasingly not an option however.  The primary stores of 1000oz bars are the LBMA vaults in London, and the COMEX.  When the COMEX starts experiencing high demand for gold or silver deliveries (typically due to the existence of premiums between paper and physical and a phenomenon known as backwardation), traders start chartering planes to deliver excess metal from the LBMA to the COMEX.  This occurred in March and April for gold and silver when physical started trading at premiums and traders began to demand delivery.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2gvzf4m15mi61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=71b04f46a16a1d389f8e9946d38d2230fe215519

The problem with this line of thought is that nearly all of the silver in the LBMA is effectively allocated already.  The most common silver ETFs such as SLV use the LBMA silver vaults to allocate silver to their ETFs, and recent historic inflows to these ETFs has created a situation where the LBMA simply does not have unallocated supply that they will be able to ship to the COMEX.  Bullionstar.com recently ran an article showing that 85% of the silver in the LBMA was now held by silver ETFs that utilize the LBMA stores. This means that this Silver cannot be taken from the LBMA to reinforce the registered stocks of the COMEX.

Also notice how last spring/summer is when LBMA inventory (shown in green) dropped, which aligns with when the silver price surged and increased COMEX deliveries were happening (2020 was a record year for deliveries).

&#x200B;

The LMBA is estimated to contain 1.08 billion ounces of silver.  Meaning that 162 million ounces aren't already allocated to ETFs.  Not known though, is how much of this 162 million ounces is owned by wealthy individuals and family offices who already have a claim to it.  Indeed, the supply situation at the LBMA is dire enough that the worlds largest silver ETF, SLV, had to change it's prospectus to mention that they may not be able to find silver to allocate to their ETF in the near future.  They made this change on 2/3 following historic inflows, but didn't make the document public until 2/8 for some reason.  Nor did they announce the change.

&#x200B;

Another decently sized silver ETF that I can't mention also changed their prospectus and directly mentioned that there might be a short squeeze and actually seems to sympathize with the hedge funds who would potentially be 'hurt' in the process

They are terrified the squeeze of the naked shorts in the silver market might actually happen.  Just as the ETFs are now warning in their prospectuses.

The report from Goldman made the ludicrous claim that each member of WSB would need to purchase 4,200 ounces of silver to cause a squeeze.  Assuming approximately 8 million members at the time, that's roughly 33.6 billion ounces of silver, and at $27.37 an ounce, would represent $920 billion worth of silver.

There is a myth that the silver market is as large as $1.5 trillion in total, which is probably where Jeff Currie from Goldman somehow came up with this $920 billion figure.  This is a vast overstatement of the available investment grade silver.  These figures represent the grand total of all silver that has ever been mined in the history of the world. The overwhelming majority of this silver has been used in the production of various electronics, medical devices, and other products and simply cannot be recovered.  Maybe at $500 an ounce, dumps will begin to look for phones and other electronics and try to chemically separate the miniscule amounts of silver from each device, but at $27 an ounce this is completely unrealistic.  Even then, it would be a minimum 6 months to get silver recycled from these devices and into the 1000oz bar format that is required for the futures market.

If you look at various sources (google it), most of them estimate the entire quantity of investable silver in the world is somewhere between 2.8 and 4 billion ounces if you include the small denominations of silver (which can't be used to deliver on the COMEX).  Using the high end estimate at 4 billion ounces, this would mean the entire investment grade silver market is only valued at $109 billion. The futures market only deals with 1000oz bars of which there is estimated to only be 2 billion ounces worth.

**There are only 0.36 to 0.52 investment grade ounces of silver per person in the world if you include both the small denominations and the 1000oz bars together. At $27.37 an ounce this is only $9.85 to $14.23 worth of investment grade silver per person.**  Go take a stroll through some of the silver forums on reddit and you'll see people are buying 6 figures worth regularly right now.

The allocated *and* unallocated silver in the LBMA and COMEX in total is roughly 1.5 billion ounces, which is a far cry from the 33.6 billion that Goldman is referring to.  As I have mentioned, most of this 1.5 billion ounces is already allocated to owners as well.

Think about 2 billion ounces worth of silver in 1000oz format. That is a tiny, tiny number.  At current prices it represents $55 billion.  There are only 2 million 1000oz bars, and each one costs roughly $27,710.

**There is another asset that has been in the news recently that is over 55k in price (WSB bans mentioning it, I'm not trying to pump it, just use it for an example).  There are only \~21 million of these items that will ever be mined, and they are valued for their scarcity and deflationary tendency.  For every ten of these** ***things which shall not be named*** **there is only** ***one*** **1000oz commercial silver bar, and each bar costs roughly half of what 1 of the** ***things that shall not be named*** **costs.**

To say that silver could not have an epic surge in the same way, despite being 10x more scarce, and half the price at that, is ludicrous. Silver is used in production of actual real things and the supply over a long enough period will actually be entirely exhausted unless we figure out how to economically mine asteroids (which would only be economical at silver prices far beyond what's ever been achieved).

As part of my research for this post I was actually able to get in touch with silver industry veteran, David Morgan (thanks for answering a random guy's twitter DM David).  He told me an anecdote from back in the previous run-up during 2010-11 where he had a conversation with Eric Sprott who mentioned that Sprott Inc's purchase of just 22 million commercial ounces to start their ETF of PSLV was enough to drive up the price by over $2 an ounce.  Unlike the other silver ETFs which just allocate silver off of the LBMA, PSLV actually sources silver in the open market to add to their vaults, which is why investing in PSLV can actually cause the silver price to rise much more directly than the other ETFs.

So who is on the other side of this trade? Banks and large hedge funds, who are massively [net short silver](https://www.cftc.gov/MarketReports/BankParticipationReports/deajan21f), to the tune of 91,468 contracts sold short compared with only 16,071 contracts long.  The banks are trying to make sure the price stays low so that they can discourage run ups in the price that would create a short squeeze (and cause them to experience massive losses on their naked short positions).

If you want more proof that these markets are historically manipulated look at the fines [JPM had to pay recently](https://www.reuters.com/article/jp-morgan-spoofing-penalty/jpmorgan-to-pay-920-million-for-manipulating-precious-metals-treasury-market-idUSKBN26K325).  Which brings me to part 2.

&#x200B;

**2. Why the 'hedge funds are pushing silver' narrative is BS**

Several posts have documented the timeline of Silver posts on WSB and why the narrative of hedge funds pushing silver to hurt GME doesn't really make sense.

Here's a couple of them that I personally liked (and there are many more): [one from u/johnnycleveland](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lemo97/how_reports_in_the_media_claiming_that_reddit/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and [another from u/blipblopbloop11](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetsilver/comments/lhqk6p/100_proof_the_antisilver_movement_in_wsb_is/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Besides the fact that many on WSB were fans of silver long before the GME craze (including myself), banks have a massive net short position in silver (which I cover later in this post).  At the time the anti-silver post went viral about Citadel having a large position in SLV, it comprised only 0.04% of their AUM, and they actually had **3 times this amount, 0.13% of AUM, in** ***PUTS*** **ON SLV.**  [Proof](https://imgur.com/gallery/2Kw2Bac).  So it doesn't make sense for them to try and stop one short squeeze that hurts them by causing a second short squeeze that would also hurt them.

I'm not sure if hedge fund bots were actually driving the anti-silver propaganda, or if it just caught on because people wanted a scapegoat for the GME losses, but either way it seems like silver was in the wrong place at the wrong time. The people investing in silver, and the people investing in GME are natural allies.  Its a mix of a desire for tendies and giving big banks and hedge funds the finger.

Why weren't AMC, BB, NOK, weed stocks, and many other popular positions not considered distractions from GME?  Wouldn't GME have gone much higher if everyone on WSB had stuck to only GME and not these other plays?

**There was absolutely institutional collusion to prevent GME from getting the infinity squeeze it was set up to get.**  The interactive brokers CEO even said on live TV that ""the price was headed to infinity"" if they hadn't stepped in to ""stop the losses"".

This collusion is simply unrelated to the fact that some of us on WSB also like the silver market setup.  I totally agree that media reports of WSB 'moving to silver' were somewhat poorly worded.  Just as the reports of WSB moving to weed stocks were poorly worded.  Some people on WSB are playing silver, some are playing weed stocks, but these headlines make it sound like it's everyone when it's never true that all of WSB is long a single trade (GME may have been close though).  I understand frustration about poor reporting.  Please don't take it out on your fellow WSB apes though.

And if you are still holding GME and think it can squeeze again, I respect that and I still hope it goes to $1,000 and higher.

&#x200B;

**3.  The fundamental case for silver, and why the shorts deserve to be squeezed**

First of all, as previously mentioned, the short side of the equation is almost entirely made up of banks and hedge funds, so keep that in mind when you might have sympathy for the shorts here.

Second, the demonetization of silver was used as a blunt instrument to impoverish the populace, and enrich the wealthy and bankers all the way back in 1873.  We know that wealth is generational, so if you had family living in the United States prior to 1873, and they were not wealthy, it is highly likely that they were massively impoverished by banker related corruption at the time.  Here's a quick rundown of what happened:

Originally both gold and silver were considered legal tender in the United States.

The monetary base was roughly half comprised of gold and half comprised of silver, with a fixed exchange rate of 15 ounces of silver to one ounce of gold.  Because silver was more common, it was considered the common currency of exchange with gold only being used by the wealthy in large transactions.

In 1873 a bill was signed to demonetize silver, while keeping gold as legal tender.

All of the common people had their savings in silver which became increasingly worth less relative to gold, while all of the wealthy had their savings in gold, so the value of their savings appreciated.

In line with the removal of 50% of the monetary base, we experienced roughly 50% deflation over the next few decades.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sjruwxd65mi61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=16da0a23620806a1d4722ff4eb9916837a67be60

Along with this deflation though, the value of debt also rose.  So if you were poor, and also likely indebted, with one stroke of a pen your money began to become worthless while at the same time your debt became progressively worth more due to deflation.  If you were a wealthy gold owner, or a bank, you likely owned that debt that became worth more alongside the gold you already held.  A double win for the wealthy, and a double hit for the poor.  One stroke of a pen created generational wealth for some, and generational poverty for others.

**Yet another reason squeezing silver, with banks on the other side of the trade would be true cosmic justice.**

Fundamentally, there are plenty of reasons why silver demand long term will rise.  On the industrial demand side, silver is used in solar panels, electric vehicles, other electronics of all kinds, and expensive space related items, where getting 100% electricity conduction is worth it compared with the second best metal of copper at 97%.  These industries are expected to grow quickly in the next decade and more silver will be needed for this reason.

Monetarily, the money supply is expanding at historic rates and most of the 'smartest people in the room' are calling for higher inflation in the next few years.  Pretty much every commodity except gold and silver have been on an absolute tear the last few months and they are breaking out into what most consider multi-year bull market cycles.  This will drive inflation even further.

Silver is more common than gold but spread rather thin in the earth's crust so it isn't mined directly in large quantities.  It's more typically a byproduct of mining for other raw materials. The lack of dedicated silver mines means that silver today is mined at only an 8-1 ratio to gold despite naturally occurring at roughly 18.75-1 ratio.  Silver is currently trading at a 66-1 ratio to gold, and gold hasn't even been rising lately.  In the 2010-2011 run we got down to a 30-1 ratio, and if people begin to worry about inflation and consider silver a monetary hedge, there's nothing stopping silver from getting to its natural ratio of 18.75-1 or even lower considering the industrial demand combined with the lower 8-1 production ratio.

These lower ratios combined with higher gold prices in the future mean that silver can realistically get above $50 in short order, possibly even above $100, and if you think the monetary system is really headed downhill, even up to the outrageous forecasts of $500+ from the likes of Patrick Karim on twitter.  Note that Patrick posts various charts all the time and his most recent forecast is $182 silver by 2023. Love your charts Patrick (give this man a follow).

In terms of timing this thing, look at the only other 3 times silver went into backwardation in the past decade (we've just entered the 4th time). Every single time it had a powerful rally afterwards, because it means that physical supply is constrained in the short run, and the shorts are trying to pay longs to get out of their contracts. And those other 3 times didn't have a true chance of COMEX default like this time does, supply/demand has never been this imbalanced and the premiums in the physical market are proof of that.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xmsp3tc63mi61.png?width=580&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa320bc6ee62d7067ab42a45a381f79139303906

**In the end, the goal of buying silver should be to make tendies and to end the manipulation of these markets. We need to get to the point where entering into a contract to sell silver means you actually have the physical silver to sell.  No more naked shorting and profiteering off the little people. An honest silver market is the ultimate goal here.**

&#x200B;

**4. TLDR, what to buy**

To get the most secure, best value for your dollar in terms of silver I would personally prioritize purchases in the following order (others may prioritize differently and that's ok):

1. Take delivery on the futures market if you are able (no premiums, but only available to large players)
2. Purchase shares of the PSLV ETF who will then purchase 1000oz bars
3. Purchase 1000oz bars at retail if you can find them for reasonable premiums
4. Purchase smaller units of silver if the premiums come down to 15% or less.  There are roughly 1-2 billion ounces of small unit silver in the world that don't directly impact the 1000oz bar market, but demand for them does cause premiums to soar, which can then cause mints to purchase 1000oz bars to smelt into smaller pieces. This is also the preferred option for those who are concerned with the total collapse of the fiat monetary system and other doomsday scenarios.  Personally I'm just wanting honest markets and to make tendies which is why this ranks 4th on my list.
5. Purchase other silver ETFs such as SLV.  Purchasing these will at least theoretically take silver off of the LBMA, but recent disclosures from these ETFs are making them seem less trustworthy (note that there is no definitive proof of any kind of fraud from these ETFs)
6. Riskier Alternatives:  Purchasing shares of silver miners, calls on silver miners, and even calls on the other silver ETFs are all riskier bets and potentially more profitable short term.  This is likely what many here at WSB are going to do

Disclosure: I am long silver miners and silver ETFs at this time

Also disclosure: make your own choices, we are all individuals, this is my personal take on the silver market and it includes plenty of speculation and opinion.  Treat this post as just that, some random guy's opinion on the internet.

&#x200B;

**Update:** To the people saying this 'looks fishy' because of the comment to upvote ratio or award to upvote ratio, its only that way because of the people exactly like yourself who auto-downvote anything related to silver, and really anything not GME.  If this post had the same upvote ratio as my original post 3 weeks ago I'd legitimately have 5-10x the upvotes right now. And this post is far better and more deserving than my original one was.  Its a self-fulfilling prophecy over here where a noob sees a non-GME post, downvotes it without reading, OG WSBers see a well thought out DD and give upvotes and awards, then more cultists come along and say it looks fishy. Try reading the post first!

You know what is super fishy?  The fact that the WSB mod coup attempt occurred right when the anti-silver propaganda blew up and silver posts were banned after that as well.  Ask yourself who was in charge when silver censorship started and you'll realize what is actually fishy here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnzeho/the_silver_short_squeeze_is_glaringly_obvious_to/,TheHappyHawaiian,2021-02-20 09:42:16,6890,wallstreetbets
There's Multiple Fundamental Market Disconnects In GME... What We Saw This Week...,"Morning Apes! My main stomping ground over on WSBN is still getting bot-bombed at the moment, so I hope you don't mind me sliding in here for a quick post. You'll have to put up with me posting it myself today, instead of it getting copy/pasted, for a change.

-**Part 1: The Shorts**-

https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME

We are currently in a complete market disconnect when dealing with GME short shares.

In this graph, you will see the correlation between the red ""FEE"" line, and the blue bars showing the ""AVAILABLE"" shares to borrow. 

https://i.imgur.com/tNF8w8t.png

As the bars get smaller, the line gets higher. As the shares get harder to borrow, the fee increases. Simple business acumen.

By why isn't it actually doing that the last few weeks?

I monitor the shorts on various platforms constantly, and on Friday, we saw available to borrow shares on IBD fluctuate in the hundreds for the first time since we pulled-back to $40.

Let me say that again: **Between 2pm and 4pm on Friday 19Mar21, there were less than 1,000 shares available to borrow to short on IBD.**

Maximum shares to borrow has not increased on IBD since 3/17/21. On 3/17 there was a total available share count of 600,000. Normally as shares get lent out, the numbers gradually replenish themselves as shares are covered and new shares are located to borrow. 

https://i.imgur.com/bpLQ6MD.png

For example on 3/15, the day began with 250,000 available. It dropped to 100,000 at 12:45, before being replenished at 1:30pm back up to 250,000. They ended the day with 150,000 available, and the next day on 3/16, they had replenished to 400,000.

https://i.imgur.com/VlYnbIh.png

Well, 10:00am on 3/17/21 was the last time any shares have been replenished on IBD. The available to borrow share count has **ONLY** gone down since that time, and there has been **ZERO** meaningful replenishment. 

They couldn't even find 1,000 actual shares to borrow on Friday.

https://i.imgur.com/rUYtFnF.png

But if shares are so hard to locate right now... why hasn't the borrow fee increased?

That isn't even a rhetorical question... I'm legit asking anyone out there: How does the price to borrow DECREASE on a day when shares aren't able to be found, and after two steady days of not being able to locate new shares to lend?

Who thinks that is a good bet? Who lends such a highly volatile stock as GME, with no shares available to locate, at 0.5%? 

Someone is purposely trying to make shorting GME a cheap bet. I think someone just wants to watch the world burn, and they are selling gasoline at 0.5%...

Part 1b:

https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme

And how does IBD only show borrowable shares in the thousands, but Fintel shows the daily short numbers at 6,400,000 shares shorted for a total of 26% of the total daily trading volume?

Yes, I realize that IBD only shows a couple of brokers, that it's updated every 15 minutes, and doesn't show cumulative count... but there's a big fucking difference in the information we're being given by these two entities. IBD shows that a broker hasn't replenished any shares in 3 days, while Fintel is showing 6,400,000 shorted shares in a single day.

Where the hell are these shares being borrowed from? Or are they just being created by a market maker to sell themselves? I'm leaning toward a Bona Fide Market Maker is creating these shorts for themselves, without having to go to market to locate the borrow. I'm going to make a separate post about this later...

-**Part 2: The Fundamentals**-

Why does the market even care what we value GameStop at? Again, this isn't a rhetorical question. I'm legit curious why anyone cares if we think GameStop is worth $0 or $1,000,000 per share. The entire premise of a free and fair market is that a buyer and seller set the price. Anything else is irrelevant.

But, is it really irrelevant?

At $200 per share, GameStop has a $14bil market cap.

That's less than 3x revenue, based on previous sales... and sales are about to boom.

Every single dollar over their previous revenue that they earn on this upcoming report, is just a higher valuation for the stock to naturally sit at. There is a reason we haven't seen the price go too far under $200... and that's because the company is worth $200 a share. Not squoze, not propped-up by short hedgies buying shares... it's worth $200 per share. Based on fundamentals alone.

Stocks tend to be forward-looking by 6-18 months. I think this earnings report is going to paint a really bright picture for the 18 month future of GameStop.

Everyone keeps saying how brick and mortar is dead, but every GameStop location is currently profitable. It isn't about rotating out of brick and mortar into online-only... their physical locations are already generating money and brand recognition. It's just about revenue expansion, cost-cutting, and streamlining...

In my original DD back when GME was at $100, I told you how I felt that this quarters earnings are going to SMOKE expectations. I haven't changed my stance.

For instance, just think about the tailwind of Magic: The Gathering and Pokemon this year. Just wait until you hear what the trading card sales have done for their bottom line on the earnings call this week.

Ryan, if you're reading this and you guys don't have anything in your presentation planned to touch on the expansion of your footprint in the trading card sector... this is your wake-up call. Put that in there. It's going to turn into a huge revenue stream for you if you treat it correctly. You need to get your ass on the phone with Papa Hasbro/Nintendo and set up a direct distribution model to turn GameStops into mini Pokemarts and MTG centers for people to buy product at. And start selling booster boxes for fucks sake.

GameStop has revenue streams that they haven't even begun to tap into yet. Management has shit the bed for years and failed to innovate. The potential in GameStop is massive, it just wasn't being utilized. The brand recognition and multi-national footprint alone is valuable.

Look at it this way:

NKLA is a fucking scam, claims to have around 300 employees, produced $95,000 in annual revenue, and it has a market cap of $6bil. 

GameStop has 5,500 physical locations, employs over 50,000 people, produced $5,000,000,000 in annual revenue, and has a current market cap of $14bil.

And the market has the balls to tell *US* what a good investment is?... Fuck off Cramer. Zero chance in hell that any analyst would debate me in real time and unscripted on the fundamentals of GameStop.

The old market is just pissed off that they missed out on something... just like they've been pissed off at Tesla for years. They'll do and say anything to protect their ego. It's not even just about money at this point. They have to prove they were right. GameStop will be sitting at $1200, and they'll be telling us how it's heading for $12.

-**Part 3: The Volume**-

Go check any of your favorite boomer stocks and look at the volume on Friday. I'll bet that most of them have a higher than normal volume showing on Friday due to witching day.

- Coke: 15-20m average... 63.5mil on Friday
- McD's: 3-4mil average... 7.5mil on Friday
- JNJ: 5-10mil on average... 15mil on Friday
- PG: 6-10mil on average... 20mil on Friday
- Petco: 1-5mil on average... 10mil on Friday
- GameStop: 50mil on average... 24mil on Friday (fuckery)

Wait. What?..

Now yes, I do realize that there are going to be some outlying companies that don't see an increase in trading volume on a quad witching day... 

But GameStop's volume trended *negatively* for the day. And not just negative, but almost half of it's 50day and 200day daily volume averages. On a quad witching day when ETFs were rebalancing?..

So. You're telling me that on the one day that shorts were impossible to locate to borrow, that trading volume just happened to be half of its average... on the highest trading volume day of the year. Alrighty then.

-**Part 4: The Options**-

~10,500. 

That's how many calls finished in the money for the 19Mar21 contracts at $200 on Friday. That's 1,050,000 shares that need to be delivered by Tuesday. That's 1.5% of the total actual float.

I've already explained to everyone how I believe two hedgies (or one hedgie with two accounts) are trading the same bundle of shares back and forth with each other to artificially inflate volume.

Trading 1,000,000 shares for a $00.0001 spread on an off-exchange pool costs $100 per 1,000,000 volume. I honestly believe that the daily short volume is closer to 75% of the actual daily open market activity, and that the remaining volume is a single hedgie (or two) trading the same shares to themselves at the 4th decimal point on an off-exchange to spoof volume and cover up the true short percentages.

We should see early this week how an extra 1,000,000 actual shares effects the price. Could be interesting. 

Someone was trying hard to keep it under $200... it took 1,250,000 in volume in under a minute to keep the price over $200 to close at the bell. 1,250,000 shares in under a minute, and the price went straight sideways. 

Those were ~1,000,000 shorts hitting the bid side but not being able to drop the price. No one sold 1,000,000 shares in the last 60 seconds when they have all of after hours to see where the price goes. Those were all shorts attacking the price before the bell.

Now, there were less than 400,000 shares up for delivery at $200. If the daily volume is truly as high as it's being shown to be... 400,000 shares shouldn't even make a blip on the daily chart... so why would someone fight so hard at the close to stop 400,000 shares?... Unless the actual volume is much lower...

-**Conclusion: Have A Good Sunday!**

Rest up apes. Our battle continues.

**Edit:**

The day the Robinhood threads were circulating was 3/17/21. The day that shorts stopped being able to be located to borrow on IBD was 3/17/21. The day people started transferring out of RH and setting their accounts to strictly cash was 3/17/21...

Hmmmmmmmmm....

Gamestop's $400 Billion NFTransformation,"**TA;CR: Ape always ask ‘Wen Moon’, but not ‘How Moon?’ This is the way to ‘How Moon’.**

The financial media’s criticism of Gamestop for the past year and a half was the lack of direction and forward statements from the company outlining a path to profitability. The developments from the company show that it is well on the way to addressing a share of a digital gaming assets and collectibles market worth well over $400 billion with a double digit industry CAGR. In other words, the NFT marketplace is positioned under a ton of rocket fuel, and Gamestop is one of the first movers in this space. The bear thesis is heavily reliant on Gamestop being left behind as gaming turns digital. This bull thesis is predicated on Gamestop becoming the next destination for all things gaming and collectible.

In this DD, I will be examining the rise and fall of Gamestop, which forms the bear thesis. I will then rend and tear the bear thesis brick by brick using verifiable, factual information from official statements, channel partners, market research, and the company reports. Don’t trust me, read it for yourself and make your own decisions because it’s your money, your investment, and you are the only one responsible for the soundness of your investment. I am too retarded to give financial advice and like the stock. I believe that hype can only move a stock price so far, the company needs fundamentals to stand on in order to bring long term value. Today, I present those fundamentals. Buckle up.

**Part I, The Rise and Fall of Gamestop**

Once upon a time in 1984, two dudes from Harvard opened up a video game retailer named after an ancient computer nerd, Babbage’s. It became a major player in the sale of video game cartridges in the United States, providing market data like this chart here from 1994:

&#x200B;

[From EGM 68](https://preview.redd.it/4t980cqptnk91.jpg?width=1844&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3831a176129bffd741af9ffec971639d401dd29c)

Through a series of sales and mergers, it became the Gamestop we know today. In the cartridge and disc era of gaming (from 8 bit consoles up to the Wii), Babbage’s became a major retailer that saw up to 75% of sales coming from video games. It would later acquire rival retailer Electronics Boutique in 2005 and consolidated the brand under Gamestop worldwide in 2021. Games were bought, sold, rented, and resold as physical media:

[Before the internet, you had to talk to strangers!](https://preview.redd.it/iw741i7ttnk91.jpg?width=1389&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c9488e6972d01cff6d39e467d7e47e7615eb631a)

Digital distribution was still in its infancy from the 1990s, with shareware software titles barely making a dent in the gaming industry market share compared to console sales. This also gave Gamestop, the largest video game retailer, some marketing clout with midnight launches and preorders of consoles and games, which may be sold out for weeks after the initial launch. Digital launches of games have made the midnight launch events for software a relic of the past. Console hardware shortages are still a problem down to this day. However, the profit on consoles are slim with single digit percentage margins. During Gamestop’s best years, 2005-2009, sales of used games and gaming accessories brought in billions of dollars for the company, with used game sales being the high margin cash cow.

This report: [https://www.gamedeveloper.com/pc/analysis-gamestop-profit-margin-on-used-almost-50-](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/pc/analysis-gamestop-profit-margin-on-used-almost-50-)

gives us a snapshot of Gamestop’s revenue streams during its best years. The margins were high for Gamestop because the used game business model was notorious for its poor value proposition to customers, which saw low values for trade-ins (slightly lower if you were a rewards member and got Game Informer) and used games selling for almost the same price as new games. Since few places offered trades for games, Gamestop min-maxed their business model by giving customers the lowest value possible and maximizing profits by selling used games for only a few dollars below new games. Turnaround on titles like EA Sports Roster: Shovelware Edition (we buy: $4, we sell: $55 used, $60 new) brought in big bucks. More importantly, the game developers never saw a dime from the resale of used games. It all went to Gamestop. This is a key point of contention, one that ultimately fueled the bear thesis for Gamestop, the migration of games to digital distribution, and the removal of disc drives from consoles.

Customers were angry at Gamestop for a poor customer experience when buying and selling games. Developers / publishers were angry at the used game market undercutting their sales. When internet speeds around the world improved to the point where video could be streamed and digital storefronts like the Epic Games Store, Steam, and GOG became more attractive options for both customers and developers, it left Gamestop and its 2 billion used copies of Fallout 76 in the dust (just kidding, they were new). Many customers no longer had the need to go to Gamestop and preorder a game, especially when the larger developers like EA and Blizzard had their own digital storefronts, where disappointments like Warcraft 3: Reforged would hide behind a thin veneer of marketing instead of occupying an entire warehouse full of physical disc returns. When consoles started shipping without physical disc drives, this was just another nail in the coffin for Gamestop’s outdated business model. Then, in 2020, a global pandemic with an unknown virus and no known cure at the time drove fear to an all-time high and lowered all foot traffic to stores as one place after another instituted lockdowns. The Gamestop management at this time forced stores to stay open, getting a ton of bad press. In the middle of all this misery was a rainbow colored bear, happy to profit off the impending bankruptcy of one of the most hated and irrelevant companies now on its death throes. The fabulous bear would call out to many hedgies and have them short the stock to the point where it was cellar boxed, never close or disclose their positions, many of them sold naked, and to never pay tax on their ill-begotten gains. Here is the bear’s thesis:

**1)** **Gamestop is a dying brick and mortar company with an outdated business model**

**2)** **The transition to digital distribution will reduce revenue across all its stores and make Gamestop increasingly irrelevant in the market that it operates and remove its major driver of profits, used physical copies of games**

**3)** **The last major pandemic lasted 3 years, at which point the lockdowns will have long bankrupted Gamestop, which was severely handicapped under an existing loan agreement and lacking funds to execute any kind of turnaround plan**

**4)** **Gamestop is hated by customers, developers, and employees alike. Everyone wants to see this ship burn and sink.**

Fabulous Bear: Sounds like easy money, doesn’t it? To minimize risk, Gamestop and other brick and mortar companies like it, were put into massive basket swaps that bet on many or all of these companies going to zero. Some firms may have shorted the stock like crazy by a variety of means because these companies are already on shaky ground and cannot secure the funding they need to defend themselves, because the same firms control the funding sources. It’s as easy as taking money from a retarded ape. The only way this plan could go tits up is if somehow, some way, a massive amount of retail investors don’t give in to fear, change sentiment on the company and refuse to sell, allowing the company to fund itself out of bankruptcy using the sale of its own stock like a car crash victim flipping over a burning car by brute force and then putting out the fire with its own piss. But that’s a viral black swan event that has never happened before in the history of stocks, so why worry, right? Retail traders will just take their lumps, sell, and move on, wiser and poorer like they always do, amirite? Amirite?!

Narrator: The bear was not right. Ladies, gentlemen, degenerates, and apes, we have entered the other side of the trade we were never supposed to see. But first, a message from Little Johnny, the 12 year old gamer who goes to Gamestop.

**Part II – The Liquidity Problem**

It is 2009. Meet Little Johnny, a 12 year old American boy with no job, no income outside of household chores, shoveling snow, or selling lemonade. Oh, and birthdays and Christmases. Johnny has a Playstation 3 (2007 was the best Christmas ever) and a small library of games. Johnny has beaten all of those games and he’s bored of them. Johnny’s only source of new games are birthdays and Christmases, but 2008 was hard on everyone, and instead of a new Wii, he got a copy of Lee Carvallo’s Putting Challenge. Uncharted 2 came out, and he wants to play it. Badly. His parents say no, he has enough games already. Well, how about he trades them in at Gamestop for a copy of Uncharted 2? The parents are spared from paying anything, so the next time at the mall, Little Johnny trades in his pile of used games for a slightly used, but very playable, copy of his next game. Little Johnny is an asset provider, and hundreds of thousands of gamers like him once made up the asset pool of used games, which Gamestop arbitraged to maximum advantage to reap billions in profit. Not one cent goes to the developers. Keep this core concept in mind, that the customer is the asset provider, Gamestop is the platform to execute the trade, and the game developer is the one who mints the game’s asset supply, because this is the basis of Gamestop’s NFT marketplace. In 2009, this trading relationship was flawed. The asset provider, Johnny, and the supply minter, the developer, suffered under the massive arbitrage of Gamestop’s trading platform.

Remember the landing page for Gamestop NFT? It read: Power to the Players. Power to the Creators. Power to the Collectors. We are going to look at how this new mantra benefits limited asset providers like Little Johnny later.

We now return to breaking the bear thesis, brick by brick:

**Part III – The Technology Company**

Bear Thesis: Gamestop is a dying brick and mortar company with an outdated business model

Bull Thesis: Gamestop is evolving to a technology company with a modernized business model utilizing an NFT marketplace to tap into web3 and mobile gaming opportunities as the new, dominant revenue stream. It has increased profitability by closing down unprofitable stores upon expiry of leases and investing in logistic centers to cover the gaps in service as part of their e-commerce expansion.

The key to any transformation is understanding the core processes of the business and the needs of the customer. Netflix saw itself as an entertainment provider and transitioned from a mail order DVD rental service to a streaming platform. I believe that Gamestop sees its role as a trading platform for gamers and collectors and has taken material steps to ensure that its role as a platform will be secured in the future – by making right with the customer and the developers. This will be the fundamental change that will break the bear’s back.

To succeed, according to the Gamestop chairman: “Gamestop needs to evolve into a technology company that delights gamers and delivers exceptional experiences”. This is from the investor letter filed on November 16, 2020.

The hiring spree for web3 developers, the launch of the NFT marketplace and choice of channel partners to execute the NFT strategy telegraphs the next area of expansion for Gamestop, a market segment that a video game retailer and other competing brick and mortar stores cannot touch – mobile gaming. As much as true gamers want to snob mobile gaming as microtransaction riddled toilet games, the market segment can no longer be ignored as a revenue stream for those seeking profitability. Page 2 of the letter mentions of one the key squandered opportunities was “The explosion of mobile”. Notable hires to Gamestop in the past year are Matt Finestone, Larry Cheng, Matt Furlong, and a parade of tech talent who have left prominent positions in larger companies to work for Gamestop, and paid mostly in stock. These people are high net worth individuals who have bet their careers and their salary on Gamestop, and they are on the board of directors.

The next indicator of a soft pivot to e-commerce is the acquisition of distribution warehouses, which will serve customers in areas where unprofitable stores have their leases closed out. While Gamestop cannot reverse the trend of brick and mortar stores dying out, one action it can take is to minimize losses from existing stores and improve delivery to retain customers in those areas. The massive uptake in web3 and logistics talent plus the acquisition of distribution centers shows that Gamestop is rapidly positioning itself to be the current and future destination for gamers.

Bear Thesis: The transition to digital distribution will reduce revenue across all its stores and make Gamestop increasingly irrelevant in the market that it operates and remove its major driver of profits, used physical copies of games

Bull Thesis: Gamestop is building a marketplace for digital gaming assets and collectibles that will capture value from the rapidly growing mobile gaming market.

Remember when Not A Cat was talking about the relevance of discs and the impact on Gamestop? He was also very close to the concept that Gamestop is now executing. In fact, on the August 3, 2020 stream, From 1:16:50-1:17:54, he speaks about Gamestop being “a clearing house for used games”. This was the right idea on the wrong side of the chart. More specifically, this one:

&#x200B;

[Oh no, discless consoles will destroy GME!](https://preview.redd.it/vlg8oie2unk91.jpg?width=571&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5c0d50c3fd7efc57703f9147988e2ae973ef70e6)

&#x200B;

[When in doubt, Zoom Out!](https://preview.redd.it/dxoe4fj5unk91.jpg?width=1772&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0f609bdbf68c7038808fb8ddad4e988f868c892b)

Source: Mobile Gamers Whitepaper by Newzoo

This shows how big mobile gaming happens to be. It’s now the largest segment of the gaming industry. Aside from Fortnite Funko Pops and gift cards, Gamestop currently sees no revenue from mobile games. The mobile gaming market also functions very differently from console gaming, with most games being free to download instead of charging $60-$70 a copy. There is no value in selling a copy of titles like Candy Crush Saga because the game itself is free. Instead, games like these are loaded with microtransactions like power ups, battle passes, and ingame equipment with separate bonus rolls, all paid for with ingame currency, which can either be earned ingame or purchased outright. The key point we want to focus on here is purchased outright – because all phones now come attached with a wallet connected to a payment method, like Google Pay, iTunes, or Apple Pay. There is also a lower barrier to entry for mobile games since they do not require purchase of a separate console to play. The games also come with inherent problems, like randomized loot drops and equipment set bonuses for said randomized drops, which compels the player to sink in more and more money. All this revenue is cut between the developer and the app store.

If we go back and look at 12 year old gamer Little Johnny, 2022 edition, we now have a problem. All his money is sunk into one mobile game, and there’s no way he can sell his in-game assets to provide liquidity for the new mobile game all his friends are playing. There are third party websites where whole accounts can be sold, but these are against the developer’s terms of service and give horrible trade in values that are pennies on the dollar or less – much worse than 2009 Gamestop trade in values. Also, he hates the loot box mechanic because it’s basically a Skinner Box with some shiny loot on the cover.

Enter Gamestop NFT and Immutable X. They are currently building games that are free to download and play, with the items earned in each game as a digital asset in the form of a non-fungible token, or NFT. Gamers who play these games, whether on mobile, console, or PC, can now earn in-game rewards, use them for loot boxes, and then sell those digital assets to players who don’t like loot box mechanics. If players like Little Johnny want to migrate to a new game, he can sell some or all of his in-game assets on Gamestop NFT with a marketplace fee that Gamestop collects, and then use the tokens in his Gamestop Wallet to purchase loot in another game. The developer makes money on the initial sale of digital currency, and then recurring revenue on the resale of the ingame assets via Gamestop NFT. The players gain liquidity that was previous sunk into one game’s economy. This will be how Power to the Creators, Power to the Players, Power to the Collecters plays out.

For proof, here’s the Immutable marketplace:

&#x200B;

[The Multiverse of gaming and collectibles is here!](https://preview.redd.it/iymanu19unk91.jpg?width=2228&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f1d2561bcd218b0d8b70b519e1838b195d8c9d61)

You can pick up any game, like Gods Unchained, win some cards through card packs, and then sell those cards (which exist as NFTs) for IMX tokens or another cryptocurrency, and then use the wallet funds to buy items in another game like Guild of Guardians (or cash out for fiat currency). This is currently done via Metamask and integration with the IMX wallet, but improvements made on the marketplace now include the Gamestop Wallet, which launched this year. Liquidity for games has gone digital, with Gamestop once again becoming the place to go for exchanging games, or in this case, the digital assets within free to install games.

Another key metric that would have supported the bear thesis is consistently declining sales revenue per quarter. If we examine the most recent Gamestop form 10-Q, the opposite is true. Sales revenue has consistently increased Y2Y per quarter since the pandemic, which indicates that the publicity received by the sneeze had an overall positive effect on the brand. Gamestop’s diversification into trades of digital gaming assets via mobile gaming and improving sales revenue disproves this part of the thesis.

Bear Thesis: The last major pandemic lasted 3 years, at which point the lockdowns will have long bankrupted Gamestop, which was severely handicapped under an existing loan agreement and lacking funds to execute any kind of turnaround plan.

Bull Thesis: The pandemic lockdowns have mostly ended. Gamestop raised enough money to sustain operations through sale of stock. It is currently executing a turnaround plan centered around growing ecommerce and web3.

When Gamestop sold off its stock, it used the funds and cash on hand to pay off its debt obligation early. The obligation effectively crippled the company and prevented it from issuing dividends and a slew of other actions that could have been used to service the debt. This obligation was critical to containing Gamestop under the bear thesis and ensuring that the company collapsed under the load, just like Blockbuster – Netflix did not kill Blockbuster, it was the debt bomb during the IPO that did. With interest rates rising, any companies that have a heavy debt load are looked upon less favorably since that debt is now harder to service. Other than retail leases and some covid assistance loans, Gamestop holds no significant debts. This effectively kills the ‘death by crushing debt burden’ part of the bear thesis. Furthermore, the pandemic lockdowns did not last as long as the analysts expected.

Gamestop has used its new lease on life to soft pivot to ecommerce and create a marketplace that targets two new market segments in gaming and collectibles that it plans to monetize. These two sectors are mobile gaming and digital collectibles.

With Gamestop’s entry into the mobile market, it looks to address a segment that now makes up 52% of all total gaming revenue. More people are getting smartphones compared to consoles, with the console market actually shrinking 6% YoY due to hardware shortages, while mobile gaming revenue has a forecast CAGR of 12.2% to 2030. Mobile games have shorter development times compared to most console games and the ubiquitous nature of smartphones creates an environment where games can generate record revenue in a very short period of time. Games like Genshin Impact took a bit over 5 months to reach $1 billion in sales. PUBG and Candy Crush Saga still make over a billion dollars revenue a year. By comparison, Bethseda’s lifetime revenue on Steam, totaling 12 years, took in $714 million (source: [https://vginsights.com/developer/14012/bethesda-game-studios](https://vginsights.com/developer/14012/bethesda-game-studios) ). It’s fair to say Gamestop is jumping in a much bigger pond. To date, the only blockchain mobile game to surpass $1 billion in revenue is Axie Infinity, and it’s not even a AAA title by any stretch. Gamestop’s marketplace will really take off when more players realize they are being screwed out of liquidity by developers under the current model and more developers realize they have a recurring revenue stream through a digital marketplace. This is taken from the landing page of Immutable’s flagship game, God’s Unchained:

&#x200B;

[Power to The Players, once more!](https://preview.redd.it/shz76n9dunk91.jpg?width=2068&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c6d5c9db2bea6d42e614e9178cb7d6b5245ca5fa)

The days of stranded cash shop assets in closed gaming economies are numbered. Players deserve better, and Gamestop is a brand they have always trusted to get value for their gaming assets.

The other half of the equation is the NFT collectibles market. Despite claims that the NFT market is dead, total market size grew 28% from last year. This is in line with the analyst predicted CAGR of 30-33% of the NFT market, expected to top $120 billion by 2026 (probably much sooner if the backwards hoodie guy markets the Wu-Tang album). Even if you are a skeptic and believe NFTs are nothing more than digital POGs, it’s worth noting that from 1994 to 1998, pretty much every movie, TV show, and major brand had its own POGs and spent hundreds of millions of dollars marketing cardboard tiddly winks. Some of those complete sets are still worth money today and appreciated in value. Once major brands start using the technology as part of their marketing efforts or to authenticate high end merchandise, the same people who couldn’t see past the ugly, overpriced apes will be part of the same myopic crowd who thought the internet was nothing more than a fad with a bunch of dancing hamsters.

Not only is Gamestop not going bankrupt any time soon, it is positioning itself to be a major player in the digital gaming assets and digital collectibles markets, which has a total projected market value of $400 billion by 2030 and double digit CAGRs. By comparison the bear thesis sees Gamestop dying by losing more and more of its market share in the shrinking $50 billion console gaming market. Based on Gamestop’s most recent balance sheet and future market ambitions, no part of this section of the bear thesis can be defended.

The next part of this DD will cover the Transformation in Action and The Forward Looking Bull Thesis. Stay tuned.

**Attack of the Fanboy** - Kyle Hanson - [5 / 5 stars](http://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/legend-zelda-breath-wild-review/) (Switch)

>The simple fact is that The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is one of the best games ever made. It marks a turning point for the medium that will be learned from for some time. It is a system seller in every sense of the word, and if you don't already have a way to play it, you owe it to yourself to find one.

>Despite a weak performance on the TV and some unimaginative Riddles, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild presents itself as probably the best launch title of the current console generation.  The enormous open world

>Nintendo has achieved something really special with Breath of the Wild. All that’s holding it back are the glaring framerate issues, but even that’s not enough to dim the greatness that shines through. After trying for nearly a decade, the Zelda team has finally made a radical departure from the established Zelda formula. This is a bold new direction for the series, one that so perfectly embraces the spirit of the original NES adventure and re-imagines it for a new generation. Rather than striving to outdo Ocarina of Time, Nintendo has given us something entirely different, yet its impact is just as profound. Breath of the Wild is a landmark game that’s hopefully just the start of an amazing future for Link’s continuing adventures.

**EGM** - Emma Schaefer - [9.5 / 10](http://www.egmnow.com/articles/reviews/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review/) (Switch)

>While Breath of the Wild doesn't follow the standard Zelda formula, it may be the quintessential example of the Zelda spirit. With a stunningly beautiful and interactive world, surprising difficulty, and a dizzying amount of riddles and puzzles, there's no end to the secrets hidden in the vast land of Hyrule.

>There is no other way to define The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild other than sheer genius. Link's immense and extremely ambitious quest takes the series into new heights, as it introduces elements of survival and item management, bringing new life into a saga that now puts the players in the middle of an open and free roaming adventure, rewarding explorers at every single moment with its beautiful settings and far-reaching worlds. Nintendo has delivered and Breath of the Wild is one of the shiniest stars that could ever light up a new system upon its launch.

--------------

**Game Revolution** - Jonathan Leack - [5 / 5 stars](http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild) (Switch)

>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild isn’t just good, it’s the best launch title I’ve ever played. It will single-handedly validate the purchase of the Switch for many people, and given the device's $299 price tag that's a huge accomplishment.

--------------

**GameSpot** - Peter Brown - [10 / 10](http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review/1900-6416626/) (Switch, Wii U)

>No matter how gorgeous its environments are, how clever its enemies are, and how tricky its puzzles get, the fact that Breath of the Wild continues to surprise you with newfound rules and possibilities after dozens of hours is by far its most valuable quality. It's a game that allows you to feel gradually more and more empowered yet simultaneously manages to retain a sense of challenge and mystery--which, together, creates a steady, consistent feeling of gratification throughout the entire experience. Breath of the Wild is a defining moment for The Legend of Zelda series, and the most impressive game Nintendo has ever created.

>It's a liberating experience by recent Zelda standards--and one that guarantees everyone's voyage will be unique and truly their own. It's an adventure that is frequently brilliant, and puts exploration and freedom back at the forefront, giving you true agency over your own adventure. While it may not be perfect, such as with the lacking story, uneven voicework, and everything about that stupid inventory, it otherwise provides an extremely promising foundation for Nintendo to build and improve on and I can't wait to see where the series takes it next.

>I’ve mentioned Ocarina of Time a few times, and there’s a reason – it is the benchmark by which all other Zelda games are tested. Somehow, and beyond all of my expectations, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild exceeds that mark. I can confidently declare that Breath of the Wild is the best Zelda game ever made.

>This sense of wonder is something that I haven’t felt so strongly since I played A Link to the Past when I was seven years old. Ocarina of Time was able to capture some of that same magic in my teenage years. Now that I’m in my thirties, I don’t think that I expected it to be possible for a game to make me feel like that again. I’ve been reviewing video games for twelve years now, and I’m used to describing games in a certain way. “This game controls well. This mechanic is innovative. The graphics are stunning. The skill tree feels limited.” That type of language doesn’t adequately convey how Breath of the Wild made me feel. Nintendo may have changed so many long-standing traditions of the Zelda franchise, but the spirit of discovery is as strong as it’s ever been no matter your age. I didn’t think I’d feel the Zelda magic this strongly ever again, but I couldn't be happier to be proven wrong.

**Nintendo Life** - Thomas Whitehead - [10 / 10](http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/the_legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild) (Switch)

>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a landmark release for its franchise and Nintendo. It's the first time that Nintendo has truly taken on the open-world genre in a current-generation sense; in arriving late to the party, though, it embraces some strengths from top-of-the-class games while also forging its own identity. This game is a revolution for the franchise, but the Legend of Zelda essence is still there - its soul remains.The end result, then, is a captivating experience. This will be in the running as the best game in the IP's history, and it will likely be discussed as a leading contender in the broader open-world genre. Nintendo has bravely taken one of its biggest franchises in a new direction, and it's delivered a triumph.

>The depth you expect, the open exploration and constant sense of discovery the series is known for, are here in perhaps greater effect than ever before, but with the systems and mechanics that drive the moment-to-moment action heavily overhauled. The result is a Zelda that feels unmistakably like a Zelda, but that also breathes new life into the venerable classic. It’s too early to fully weigh it against the historical record, but if forced to rank the entire coterie of Zelda games, Breath of the Wild would come in near the very top.

>I guess, in the end, it's not just that Breath of the Wild signals that Zelda has finally evolved and moved beyond the structure it's leaned on for so long. It's that the evolution in question has required Nintendo to finally treat its audience like intelligent people. That newfound respect has led to something big, and different, and exciting. But in an open world full of big changes, Breath of the Wild also almost always feels like a Zelda game — and establishes itself as the first current, vital-feeling Zelda in almost 20 years.

It's captivated me more than any game with a system launch, and it's rocketed straight into number one on my all-time favourite Zelda games. You could play it on Wii U, where it's still a fantastic game — clearly the best on the console. But it's that little bit more special to have such an amazing, massive game on a handheld system. Wherever you play, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild was worth the wait.

It suffers from a few frustrations, most notably the strange desaturation filter that pervades the graphics, but they're all easily forgivable when held against the sheer scope and variety of what you can do in the game. This is the biggest and most impressive Zelda game we've seen yet, and after 30 hours in Hyrule I'm still finding new things.

>In reinvigorating the Zelda series, Nintendo has rediscovered what gave it life all those years ago, capturing a spirit of adventure that flows through Breath of the Wild like the breeze on Hyrule's fields.

A masterpiece.

Exploring can be fun, but it doesn't make up for a lack of other things I want and expect in a Zelda game, and while there are enjoyable moments in Breath of the Wild simply extending the amount of time it takes to get from point A to point B does nothing to advance the series in a meaningful way.

>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a landmark achievement for both the Zelda franchise and Nintendo as a whole. It’s a brave new step into uncharted territory that continues to offer surprises and challenges long into its massive running time. I can’t overstate how great it is to see the Big N taking risks again — though the vast majority of them do pay off, I have to admit I felt a good deal of affection even when the chances they took fell flat. This is an adventure that people will be talking about for a long time to come, and let’s hope that encourages the beloved Japanese developer to keep trying new things as it moves into a new generation of interactive entertainment.

Breath of the Wild may not only be the best Zelda game ever produced, but it rivals Super Mario 64 and Halo: Combat Evolved for the best launch game ever shipped with any console.

>Breath of the Wild is without a doubt one of the best and most complex games in Nintendo's history. With an open world full of wonders, its addictive ambience seduces you constantly to explore the depths of Hyrule while it defies the best of your skills with perfect mechanics in combat. By far is among the most enjoyable sandbox games.

>This is the pinnacle of adventuring, Zelda style. It takes the core elements that fans know and love from Nintendo's long-standing series, and mixes it smoothly in with gorgeous open-world exploration of Xenoblade Chronicles, to craft something so breath-taking and absorbing that hours upon hours will pass by without notice, and barely any progress will have actually been made in the main story because there were so many other aspects to take in and play around with, as well as sub-missions that fit so naturally into the core quest. Nintendo has outdone itself with The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - absolutely sublime work.

Smart puzzles, dungeon-dwelling bosses, charming characters, and imaginative storytelling are still on the agenda.

>Miyamoto and Aonuma are never tired of repeating, that the main thing in The Legend of Zelda games is that absolute feeling of discovery. Breath of the Wild reveals this emotion better than any part of the series. It's amazing how the developers have managed to bring so many different concepts, mechanics and stories together and offer them in a form of an open, organic, and natural world. At the same time they have put the advanced physics engine to the basis of the game, leaving a huge space for experiments. You need time to acknowledge the impact of Breath of the Wild on the genre development and the following games of the series. But we can already say that the most ambitious and innovative ""Zelda"" for the last 20 years is right in front of us.

>I’ve honestly fallen head over heels in love with Breath of the Wild in a way I’ve not fallen in love with an open world game before. While many of the singular elements I’ve spoken about here may not sound terribly groundbreaking for the genre, the way they come together once you’re a couple of hours deep is some of the best paced, polished and fun open world design I have ever experienced. The separate parts combine into something far exceeding their sum total.

>I think the result of all of its interlocking systems is a game that wants to slam you with moments of epiphanies. For me, my experience with Link’s Awakening was about getting that one major flash of insight and then using that to understand the rest of the game and then the rest of the Zelda series. For Breath of the Wild, Nintendo made a game that could replicate that moment over and over.

>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is simultaneously the swan song for Wii U, and the greatest possible beginning for Nintendo Switch. The experience is so phenomenal, it deserves to be in the conversation about the best Zelda game of all-time, if not the best games of all-time. When I say Breath of the Wild is a must-play title, it's not hyperbole, you simply must play this game.

>The unique order of these experiences has only been possible thanks to Breath of the Wild's willingness to let me act on a whim. It's a type of freedom I haven't experienced in years and a complete 180 from Skyward Sword. I'm completely intrigued by this game and I haven't even traversed my first dungeon yet. I don't know what the next 10 hours hold -- hopefully a dungeon -- but right now I'm gobsmacked by how enjoyable this romp through Hyrule has been.

**AITAH for refusing to go to my ""best guy friend's"" wedding and telling my parents I am going to cut them off?** 

**Originally posted to r/AITAH** 

**Thanks to u/queenlegolas & u/soayherder for suggesting this BoRU** 

**TRIGGER WARNING:** >!emotional abuse, controlling behavior, bullying, harassment!< 

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/16UsSnsnch)  **July 16, 2024** 

I grew up with my family and another family whose parents were best friends with mine since high school. My parents had me (F28) and my two older brothers (M31 and M35), while their friends had four boys (M27, M29, M30, and M37). 

Growing up was pretty nice, but the boys used to pick on me a lot and exclude me during their ""girls are yucky"" phase. I wouldn't say I see these boys as brothers, but maybe as cousins. 

I was close to M27 and M29 when we were little. I will call them Adam and Jake. Until we were 15, we were really close and did a lot together. 

I don't talk to Jake much anymore. No hard feelings, but he grew up to be a classic tech bro and can be pretty condescending. However, our families are obsessed with the idea of us ending up together. The other guys are already married, and Adam is gay. They've always pushed for us to be together (making us go to the store alone at Christmas, telling us both an earlier time to meet at the restaurant for Dad's birthday, talking him up a lot, etc.). 

Then both Jake and I met our SOs. I have been with my fiancé for 5 years, and Jake met his fiancée 3 years ago. Our families have been very disappointed and have not welcomed our SOs warmly. One Christmas, I took Jake's fiancée, Tracy, aside and explained the weird family lore to her. With Jake (just like we did with my fiancé), we assured her that it was just a weird thing of our family and that Jake and I have not been close for ages and have never had more than a friendly relationship. Ironically, having to stand against our parents made us all a little closer. 

But we come to the problem. Jake and Tracy are going to get married soon, and it has been chaos. Our parents have upped their antics by 2000%. Family dinners are full of ""ahh we thought you two would get married."" They brought out a picture I apparently drew of me and Jake when we were little of us getting married (I suspect they made it. It did not look like it was made by an actual child). They were cornering Tracy about making me the matron of honor and letting me wear white (what??). Also, his brothers and my brothers joined in, making jokes about us being star-crossed lovers and calling me ""the missus."" I distanced myself heavily from my family during that time and stopped going home after talking to them did nothing. 

One day, one of my brothers invited me out. He said it was just my two brothers and me. So, I went to his apartment, and when I arrived, it was Jake's bachelor party. One of his brothers screamed out that the ""stripper"" was here (fucking ew). I wanted to leave, but the next train left close to 12 a.m., and it was not the safest neighborhood. So, I stayed. They tried to make me drunk, were constantly physically pushing me and Jake together, and even locked us in my brother's bedroom. I could hear loud laughing from the other side. Jake and I did not talk much. He apologized to me and asked me if I could not come to the wedding as I made Tracy uncomfortable. I completely understood and said at that point I was not planning to go anymore. 

He offered to drive me home as he was also completely sober. When they opened the door, he said we were going home. In their heads, that meant we were going to be intimate or something because all the caveman sounds started. 

The next day, my phone was blowing up. Someone uploaded a video of me and Jake leaving and captioned it ""finally."" It was very awkward. I am clearly uncomfortable, and so is Jake as we exit the apartment and enter his car. There were comments, calls, and texts. Tracy called me crying and cursing me out. Jake called me apologizing and telling me he tried to explain. My mother and his mother sent me a bunch of texts saying how proud they are and that it was about time. My fiancé is understanding, but he wants me to make clearer boundaries with my family. 

I drove past their house, and they were all there. They didn't even let me talk and were just love-bombing me. I started screaming and told them Jake and I have never and will never be together and I will not be leaving my loving fiancé. That I would not be going to Jake's wedding, and if they kept up with this, I would cut every single one of them off because I am tired and just want to live my life and not their incest fairy tale. 

By the end of my meltdown, my mother and his mother were crying, and my father just told me to get out. 

Since then, I have been getting messages from my brothers calling me a bitch for treating my family like that because they only wanted the best for me. 

So, AITAH? 

Edit: no an, uber was not an option. Taxis and ubers are ungodly expensive here. Thus is take the freaking train. 

Also no we don't have a car. 

Tracy was away and my fiance had a night shift 

**RELEVANT COMMENTS** 

**OOP put this in an edit, bit is better explained in the comment** 

[Original German](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/tj5JHbbEFZ) 

>Omg yes! My brother lives in a small town. Sure, it's maybe 30 minutes by car to the next town, but it's still a village. And then it was 10 p.m. The night bus wouldn't have come until later than the train. I just checked again and an Uber would have cost me almost 80 euros because of the night fee. 

>Yes, I've blocked my parents and their friends for now. 

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/ciLNA02gH6)  **July 22, 2024**



**Update 1:** Jake and Tracy broke up.  
**Update 2:** My fiancé was cheating with Tracy the whole time!  
**Update 3:** I think I might have feelings for Jake, but I can’t let our families win.  
**Update 4:** I’m pregnant and it’s Jake’s. 

I'm kidding. Just thought this comment was particularly hilarious. 

First of all, thank you all for your insight, especially those of you who reached out in the comments and privately with similar stories. I honestly thought my family was the only demented one, but apparently, it's a trend (also, a lot of German parents have done that... in that vein... Joa scheiße, ne?). 

Now for the real update: 

My fiancé and I spoke and concluded that cutting out my family for now would be the best option. I sent a message to my parents and brothers explaining my decision to distance myself for the time being. I emphasized that while I love them, I cannot continue to endure their pressure and manipulation. I told them their behavior had made me resent them and, to some extent, Jake. They ruined any friendly relationship we could have had and made me feel gross and exploited. I told them they were setting me up to be sexually assaulted if it had been anyone else but Jake. I also told them that their controlling behavior was the reason I never told them about anything in my life. I told them it hurts to be with them, and I am in a bad mood for days after meeting them. I never look forward to holidays with them and have caught myself wishing I would get into an accident or get sick before the holidays to have an excuse not to go. They cut themselves out of my life, and they will not be there when I get married, have kids, or in any other life achievements. 

After sending the message, I left the group, blocked them all, and felt really light. I cried with my fiancé for hours, and I didn't really know if it was tears of sadness, relief, or happiness. I was so conflicted. I just kind of fell asleep. 

Jake has also cut his part of the family off. According to Tracy, he just went to their home, dumped a sack of their stuff on the table, told them to stay the fuck away from him, and left. His mother tried reaching out to me, and my father tried reaching out to Jake. Our fiancés had been targeted by them too. 

My parents sent the police to my house claiming my fiancé had me there against my will. We talked to the police. They couldn't do much but assured me that they would leave a note in their database clarifying that I am not being abused. I also asked how to go about a no-contact order, and they pointed me to resources. They also said they would tell my parents to leave me alone and noted that should they make false reports, they would have to cover the cost of the drive out to me. 

As of Friday, we have different numbers! Tracy is coming over this afternoon, and I am taking her to my nail salon, and afterward, we are going to a game store because she really wants to play some escape games. 

Jake and I are still not close, and he is also not close to my fiancé. But he is happy that we have carved out a healthy space and that Tracy is so comfortable with me now in such a short span of time. They are reevaluating their wedding plans, but I won't disclose more here. 

Also, to the people that made fun of me for saying that I couldn't drive by anywhere without a car... I have a bike. 

Anyway, that was it. It was only a week, and I don't see this going much further. My parents are going to keep contacting me probably, but it's going to be all right. We are all all right.

Directly Registering Our Shares Got Them by the Balls! 🚀🚀🚀,"Once all (or most) shares are directly registered, the DTCC will have no shares to settle trades, and all trades that are not settled (naked shorts) will fail to deliver, and must be closed by (potentially forced) buy-backs. 

Furthermore, no market makers can hide behind “a reasonable belief that they will be able to locate shares” (can’t remember the exact wording, but it’s essentially what they use to justify their naked shorting), and can no longer sell any shares short without first borrowing actual shares, which will be impossible when all market participants struggle to locate shares to settle trades that are already executed. 

Like any short squeeze in history, MOASS will be triggered as soon as short sellers **begin** to realize it is *inevitable* and *imminent*, and they start a panicked dash for the exit. They all know that the last one out is the biggest loser. And trust me, at these levels of shorting, EVERY. SINGLE. SHARE. leaving the DTCC will be felt, and short sellers, brokers and the DTCC are already starting to notice the trend. They are already shivering in their pants, and praying desperately to all imaginable gods that ComputerShare and DRS will not gain any more traction among the apes. It’s their doom.

They have gotten away with so much fuckery for so long, but they can’t escape not having *any* real shares left. This would require fuckery so obvious and severe that they would face criminal charges. They would have to blatantly and openly ignore countless laws and regulations, to the extent where the SEC couldn’t just stand by and watch even if they wanted to.

## Hedgies R fuk.

## Buy, hold, register!

##💎🙌🏼🚀🌙

This post represents my personal opinion. Based on this, I sincerely believe DRS is our best bet, and **strongly urge every ape to register as many shares as possible.** (And [Gensler said I could do just that](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/sec-chair-gensler-defends-reddit-gamestop-investors-right-to-smash-short-sellers-11631718972))

———

Edit per request to include this explanation:

ComputerShare has a “list” of shares and who owns them. Currently, most of them are owned by Cede & co. To transfer your share to CS, an entry must be changed in CS’ book, from Cede to you. And to do that, an actual share must be located and delivered, meaning that Cede must reduce their ownership count by one, and thus take that ownership from someone, your broker. 

Once people start to request transferring shares from brokers that have no actual shares left in Cede’s books (even though they should), the clearing house (DTC) must locate the share somewhere else, meaning they need to force delivery to the broker of any unsettled trade. This causes an immense pressure on DTC, market makers, prime brokers, anyone with obligations to deliver shares they don’t have. 

Once DTC deems it unlikely that a participant will be able to deliver shares that have failed to deliver, they will start force-closing the short positions of that participant corresponding to their unsettled trades (naked shorts).

India won by 3 wickets

**Ajinkya Rahane**: ""It really means a lot to us. I don't know how to describe this victory. I'm just proud of all the boys, each and every individual. We just wanted to give our best, not to think about the result. When I went in, conversation between me and Pujara was Puji to bat normal and me to go for my shots, because we knew Rishabh and Mayank were there. Credit to Pujara, the way he handled the pressure was magnificent, and Rishabh was brilliant in the end. Taking 20 wickets was the key, that's what we identified, that's why we picked five bowlers. Washington Sundar got that balance for us, intention was to play five bowlers. Siraj had played two Test matches, Saini one, Thakur one, Natarajan also on debut, all credit to them. After Adelaide we didn't discuss about what happened, we just wanted to play our game, show good attitude, show good character on the field. It was all about the team effort. I would also like to thank our fans who came out here and supported us, and the Indian team would like to give Nathan Lyon a signed jersey for his 100th Test match.""

**Tim Paine**: ""Absolutely disappointed. We came here to win the Test and win the series, it's been a bit of a trend that we were found wanting in the key moments and completely outplayed by a tough Indian side that fully deserves the win. I think there's lots of things we'll look back at, but what's done is done. We need to look forward now, there's a big series in South Africa coming up, we've been outplayed by the better side in this series. I think we got about what we wanted in the end. We wanted to set a bit over 300, dangle a carrot to win the Test match and win the series. We might have had another 20 overs had it not rained. But India turned up and put their bodies on the line. [Reviews] are part of the job. sometimes they work, sometimes they don't. But all credit to India, our bowlers threw everything at them.""
 
**Pat Cummins is the player of the series**. ""Good hard day of Test cricket today, I thought Rishabh and the whole Indian side played fantastically, took the game on and deserved the win. I would have liked the cracks to play a few more tricks, but it was a pretty good wicket. Once you were in, it was pretty free-flowing, the runs. I thought today and in Sydney the game was ours to win on day five, but we didn't take enough wickets, but overall happy [with my performance].""

**Rishabh Pant is the man of the match**. ""This is one of the biggest moments of my life now, and I'm happy that all the support staff and all my teammates supported me even when I wasn't playing,"" he says. ""It's been a dream series. The team management always backs me and tells me, you are a matchwinner and you have to go win the match for the team. I keep thinking every day that I want to win matches for India, and I did it today. It was a fifth-day pitch and the ball was turning a bit. I thought I have to be disciplined with my shot selection.""

Hedge Funds Stole the American Economy & Created the Richest Man in the World,"Oh, hey, let me just finish up this game of Smash Bros, grab a coffee, smoke a bowl real quick, watch a few episodes of Twilight Zone, then let's deep dive into this DD. It's a certified smooth-brained wall of text I promise.

I hope this write-up finds you well. Don't mind me. Just a playdoh-munching ape with a rambling problem and a stubborn interest in Wall Street's unscrupulous activities. Remember; **hedge funds thrive from making money off EVERY TRANSACTION**. Like 08' when they built nuclear bomb CDO's, sold them to unsuspecting investors, shorted them, then coordinated with ratings agencies to downgrade the bonds. Turns out the Stock Market is a **ponzi scheme** endorsed by the U.S government (what did you say Kenny? Or was that Janet Yellen just now?). **Fuckery and corruption is afoot, but how did we get here?**

So... let us journey to a simpler time; before the AMZN.

[Former V.P of Hedge Fund D.E Shaw: Jeff Bezos](https://preview.redd.it/k0zfv9ins3071.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=111dac518a6ec1b30f08ca40319c573114e97d63)

To put it bluntly; ***HEDGE FUNDS STOLE THE AMERICAN RETAIL ECONOMY. ahem, I will explain...***

***By naked shorting competing stocks, hedge funds can invest the proceeds (from that naked short sale) into AMZN stock, essentially; Wall Street steals money from a competitors' market cap and artificially inflates the price of AMZN stock. I believe this is the largest successful financial scam/grift pulled in history.***

***AMZN stock is the highest % returning stock in the last decade. Amazon was only $43 per share at 2008 lows.***

***Understanding*** ***Jeff Bezos; the*** ***~~""modest""~~*** ***mastermind*** ***VP Quant of D.E Shaw:***

**You know Jeff Bezos**; the **Former CEO of Amazon** (the web-focused retailer for literally every product you can think of) has amassed quite a shameful amount of wealth in the last 2 decades. **Currently worth over $200B**.

You may be familiar with **Bezos' modest lifestyle** early on in his career, he himself mentioned still driving his 1997 Honda Civic after Amazon went public (making Bezos worth $12 Billion) and claims he did not believe in indulging in a wasteful lifestyle.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/18/why-amazons-jeff-bezos-drove-a-honda-after-he-was-a-billionaire.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/18/why-amazons-jeff-bezos-drove-a-honda-after-he-was-a-billionaire.html)

That persona seems to have dissipated since.

""**Bezos has some** [**bigger extravagances**](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/27/how-richest-man-alive-jeff-bezos-spends-his-billions.html)**, like multiple homes, a private jet and Blue Origin**"" (Blue Origin is a space exploration company.

Up until recently, Bezos has promoted a public image that emphasized his ""geeky"" side, drawing focus to his coder, bookworm persona. It would be a great way to distract from his relationships and history with Wall Street. I mean, despite the PR, the guy is a quant!

**WHAT IS A QUANT?**

Quant is short for quantitative; in Wall Street speak it describes **a process of using mathematic modeling and HIGH FREQUENCY TRADING to identify and act on trading opportunities. In short (pardon the pun), quants specialize in calculating probability and risk, HEDGING positions/SHORTING stocks is a commonplace practice in quantitively driven fund portfolio.**

Bezos saw a business opportunity by creating and controlling a company that had strong relationships with Wall Street. A company that was willing to act in blatant anti-competitive fashion; possessing an understanding of the complex practices that inflate AMZN's market cap. A company that could rely of private equity doing their dirty work by targeting competitors through leveraged buyouts and naked shorting.

""**After graduating from Princeton, Bezos found work at several firms on Wall Street, including Fintel, Bankers Trust and the investment firm D.E. Shaw. In 1990, Bezos became D.E. Shaw's youngest vice president.**""

The title of that Fortune article, dated February 5th, 1996 reads: **WALL STREET'S KING QUANT DAVID SHAW'S SECRET FORMULAS PILE UP MONEY. NOW HE WANTS A PIECE OF THE NET.**

“I was living and working in New York City. I came across the fact that the world wide web was growing very fast and came up with this simple idea to sell books on the internet. I went to my boss David and told him the idea,” Bezos reminisced, explaining how the first seed of Amazon was sown in his head.

Okay, so it's clear **David E. Shaw (among others at D.E Shaw) was aware of Amazon's concept before it went public, had an active interest in investing in the web space and managed D.E Shaw; employing quantitative strategies during this time.**

**""D.E. Shaw & Co.** **went on to become** **one of the five highest-grossing hedge funds of all time.""**

Bridgewater was the largest hedge fund in the world in 2016 managing $140B AUM. The Blackstone Group, currently the largest private equity conglomerate by AUM; manages an absolutely absurd $211B through Blackstone Capital Partners. **This loops back to property acquisition of AMZN competitors as Blackstone owned at least one entity in every single acquisition of an AMZN competitor. Blackstone owned Bain Capital (Toys R' Us lender) in the Toys R Us acquisition, Bain Capital had input on whether or not Toys R' Us would declare bankruptcy:**

**""Prior to the filing of the amended holding reports, all of D.E. Shaw’s 13F filings dating back to May 1999 included minimal details.""**

**This would allow D.E Shaw to establish confidential naked short positions in AMZN competitors and large amounts of undisclosed shares and options in AMZN and MSFT.**

When it comes to quantitative funds, Ponzi schemes and Insider Trading grifts are common place (looking your way again right now Kenny). **An** **alarming number of quantitative funds failed catastrophically due to poor risk management and over-leveraged betting.** In 1998, Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) almost caused a fucking Global Financial Crisis (GFC) due to their **leveraged bets based off mathematical modeling and high frequency trading.** The perils in the quantitative approach often includes extremely high risks as mathematics fails to account for human behavior (just like GME apes continue holding no matter the price) and cannot accurately predict long term market activity trends.

This highlights the value of knowing the future on Wall Street. If you know AMZN competitors stock price will drop and AMZN stock will appreciate, you can structure shares and options portfolios with ridiculous leverage (just ask Bill Hwang) and insane gain potential while keeping it completely confidential.

It would make sense, if private equity hedge funds intentionally exercised their relationships and capital to destroy Amazon competitors deliberately (through leveraged buyouts and naked shorting) so Amazon could capture their market share while The Blackstone Group and KKR consumed their real estate assets.

**""Hedge funds have killed Sears & many other retailers""**

""**Sears is the fifteenth retailer to file for bankruptcy this year**, Ablin noted. It **joins other high profile private equity backed casualties** Toys “R” Us, shoe seller Nine West and quirky gadget retailer Brookstone"".

**“Hedge funds are systematically destroying jobs across the nation,” said Carrie Gleason, campaign manager for Rise Up Retail, a worker advocacy group.**

“From Toys ‘R’ Us to Sears, these financial predators are extracting the value out of these retail establishments, forcing the closure of thousands of stores, and throwing tens of thousands of workers into the streets,” Gleason added.

**EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE RETAILERS WERE PURCHASED BY PRIVATE EQUITY FIRMS. MANY OF THESE PRIVATE EQUITY FIRMS HAD LONG POSTIONS IN AMAZON. THIS IS A DIRECT CONFLICT OF INTEREST SINCE A FIRM LONG AMZN WOULD HAVE MORE TO GAIN FROM A COMPETITOR GOING OUT OF BUSINESS/RELIQUISHING MARKET SHARE.**

You'll also notice that the above CNN article does it's best to shift narrative to competing retailers inability to take online shopping seriously; but if **private equity had controlling interest, wouldn't they be at fault from negligence?** You're telling me that private equity funds who are tech-conscious, going long AMZN aren't aware of how important online retail is?

When you actually look at the numbers these ""failing"" businesses produced, they aren't ""bankruptcy"" bad at all. **Toys R' Us booked $941M in e-commerce sales in 2016.**

**Establishing a Narrative: The ""Only"" Online Retailer and ""the Technological Advantage""**

I just want to ask one question. **If being an online only retailer is the most competitive business model. Why the fuck is Amazon opening physical retail locations?**

Because the ""people only shop online"" narrative is over-embellished and AMZN was not the ""only"" online retailer (contrary to press opinion). Amazon was a company that received insanely positive reception by mainstream press and financial tabloids but the majority of their income is not provided by retail, but a result of Amazon Web Services (AWS).

**Bezos intentionally breached anti-competitive law to ensure Amazon competitors would have more difficulty establishing themselves as an online retailer.**

**Toys R Us was acquired by hedge funds 2005; Amazon started selling Toys and Childcare products 2006 with exclusivity agreement with Toys R' Us.**

**Amazon abused agreements through Merchant Partnerships with Toys R' Us:**

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon\_(company)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company))

"" In 2000, U.S. toy retailer [Toys ""R"" Us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toys_%22R%22_Us) entered into a 10-year agreement with Amazon, valued at $50 million per year plus a cut of sales, under which Toys ""R"" Us would be the exclusive supplier of toys and baby products on the service, and the chain's website would redirect to Amazon's Toys & Games category. **Amazon had knowingly allowed third-party sellers to offer items on the service in categories that Toys ""R"" Us had been granted exclusivity**. In 2006, a court ruled in favor of Toys ""R"" Us, giving it the right to unwind its agreement with Amazon and establish its own independent e-commerce website. The company was later awarded **$51 million in damages**.""

Jeff Bezos stepping down from the role of CEO on Feb 2nd. I believe this was done to prevent an individual like me from focusing on and informing a bunch of apes like you about his hedge fund history; raising questions about the legitimacy of competitive capitalism in an economy that allows for theft through naked shorting.

**Alright so, Jeff Bezos' and Bill Gates' (among other billionaires such as Gabe Plotkin's) recent divorce filings.** As I had the pleasure of learning from Joe Exotic in the documentary ""Tiger King""**, individuals will use a divorce (or marriage) as a way to protect assets from seizure through legal maneuvering.**

I believe Bezos and Gates understand that the current market environment is perilous and that many of the funds short on GME (among other high SI stocks) will need to liquidate their positions in blue chip stock upon margin call. AMZN and MSFT stand to lose a lot of capital.

**Also, real quick why hasn't Gates' firm Cascade Investments filed a 13F (required by law) since September 2008 (when Lehman and Bear collapsed)?** [**https://fintel.io/if/cascade-investment**](https://fintel.io/if/cascade-investment)

**Since 08' Cascade Investments has only filed a 15G, the SEC states this is a special form especially for firms that own ""asset backed securities"".**

* SEC Form 15-12G is the **certification and notice of termination of registration of a class of securities** under Section 12(g)of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
* The Form is also used to **provide notice of suspension of duty to file reports under sections 13** and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act.
* When a company registers securities, it is obligated by regulation to file periodic and current reports with the SEC. **Form 15-12G may end those obligations as securities are de-issued.**

**Terminated registration of securities? Notice of suspension of duty to file? End obligation to file as securities are de-issued? Sounds strange.**

Bezos and Wall Street have the resources to disseminate narratives.

Fellow ape in the comments u/BoAnonKryze :

""one possible reason why the SHFs have been attacking GME so ruthlessly and pushing hard against retail is that GameStop has positioned itself to become a very real threat to Amazon in one of the biggest and fastest growing markets on the planet""

""You 🦍s are absolutely fucking magnificent.""

**TLDR:**

**By naked shorting competitors stocks; hedge funds who held long positions in AMZN could effectively ""steal"" money from a competing companies market cap and invest it into AMZN to inflate their stock price. Jeff Bezos maintained Wall Street relationships and breached anti-competitive corporate law to ensure competitors could not pivot to e-commerce in a time sensitive fashion. It is clear that multiple conflicts of interest went unchallenged, this helped to establish a narrative while relying on hedge funds to naked short competitors stocks using HFT strategies used at D.E Shaw.**

**The combined cost to society of Sears/Kmart, Toys R Us and Borders Group Bankruptcies = 121,000 JOBS + billions in taxpayer dollars. I FEEL SICK.**

[The OC post and analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/) (which is still worth your reading, especially if you want to grasp this chapter of the post in greater detail) took me a lot of effort to produce, and I am still proud to have done this work, distilling the essential components of a short squeeze structure, and creating at least some sort of a framework to apply in cases like the current one. However, GME price during the summer did not follow the pattern, and particularly its most anticipated triangular 'Squieezluminati Confirmed' stage.

Does it render the whole thing void? Well, that's what I've been thinking in August while morally preparing myself for the beard apostasy. But something didn't quiet fit, and I kept digging. Just to stumble upon this:

[AMCSS, daily chart](https://preview.redd.it/58sg96eg53j71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b9d97cdc553fe4645cd76576d26c8b0c73122ae)

Looks familiar, doesn't it? Ladies and apemen, with a great pleasure I present you AMCSS, the timing of which is really similar to what I was betting my beard on in relation to GME. What happened to AMC during the summer actually proves almost every single point from my SS thesis. Firstly, the 'Purple Haze' level ($14.38) is the main resistance on the chart, and only when the breakout occurs, the SS unfolds. Secondly, 'Squeezy Grail' (the cup shaped consolidation) and the 'Runway' (rectangle) phases precede the squeeze impulse - that's where the buying pressure accumulates, to the point when it can no longer be suppressed. Next, interestingly enough, trend based Fibonacci periods grid allows to predict the peak date (vertical line marked as 1) extremely accurately, if the preliminary trend + the 'Squeezy Grail' phase are used as its core measurement (red dashed line). But wait, there's more! The 'Purple Haze' resistance is in between 1 and 0.786 Fibo levels (horizontal), while the retracement itself measures the amplitude of the SS impulse perfectly - e.g. take a look at how the price action retraces to 0.5 Fibo after the peak, or how the price consolidates in the channel of 0.236-0.382 after that. Well, the thesis fits almost perfectly to AMC - I hope you're now sitting like

https://preview.redd.it/nltp4a1l53j71.jpg?width=550&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3e9489b7944a802185db6adc69121f72b4e546dc

There are several minor deviations from the SS frameworks which should be mentioned too, though: the PH breakout occurs during 0.618 Fibo period, rather than 0.382, as it was in historical examples; the triangular phase doesn't really resemble a triangle. Notwithstanding those minor factors, original SS thesis is more than alive with the AMC example.

You might be thinking now: what defuq is this crazy dude is talking about, where is the video of the beard shaved? Well, I'm providing the AMCSS analysis here in order to prove that my thesis is legitimate, and GME price action had to follow the pattern. GME and AMC are like brothers in arms, with 'similar' fundamentals, and through the major part of 2021 those two have been moving in tandem, strongly following linear correlation principle. The thesis structure (built upon TSLA and VW historical examples) indicates that there is the strong buying pressure accumulating, and in AMC example the lid was opened for a bit to let the steam out; while GME is still being suppressed even further during the current consolidation, and in my opinion - it is done artificially and purposely.

Furthermore, take a look at this:

https://preview.redd.it/44m2qp2q53j71.png?width=1880&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2c9f3297506328e1c0b4a5bd4f5cfa4105a29e8

What you see above is the screenshot from [my other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwub7d/gme_to_amc_and_bb_last_week_ladies_go_first_gme/), where I explained that two stonks had extremely similar technical setups: both have long-ass triangular consolidation at the core, which is subsequently broken out to the upside. Next, take a look at MACDs or TSIs from both examples, and particularly at what is highlighted by rectangles - zoom in and see for yourself, the structures are close to being identical. So, the question arises: why if two stocks have very similar fundamental and technical backgrounds, one is allowed to moon a little bit, while the other one is being knocked out each time right before the lift off should occur? The answer if fairly obvious, and it's because some big financial boys want things to go this way. AMC is something they can control, or maybe they even benefit from it’s price fluctuations. While GME is a Pandora box, and they try to keep its lid close for as long as possible, soothed by an illusion of a controllable chaos. And those suckers are ready to use any method to suppress the price, especially \*\*insert Aliens Guy meme here\*\*: manipulation.

Apes from a friendly sub uncovered many such methods, like good old FTDs, married puts, OTC trades, wash sales, darkpools... I'm not going to discuss those things in this post, because there is a plenty of outstanding DD on reddit. I'm just going to borrow this picture from u/AutoDrafter2020 because it speaks for itself, in my opinion:

[GME daily chart](https://preview.redd.it/klztgzo563j71.png?width=1614&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e54f3009eaafcd3c4aa5f4d04ef0779fe69803a)

As you can see yourself, every major piece of fundamentally good news for GME has resulted in price suppression, and each of the dirty play instruments mentioned above played a role in this shitshow to one degree or another. The manipulation is so blatantly obvious that it makes me sick. Manipulating the market is not cheap, and probably costs fuckers on the other side of the trade millions, if not billions every month. Why would there be so much effort and resources put into the war over a ‘memestonk’? Is it so that they want some random noname reddit retard to lose his precious beard? The actual answer is shocking, and in my opinion it should be sought in two Greek letters, **σ (sigma)** and **β (beta**).

# Chapter II. How 1987 and 2008 are reincarnating into 2021

&#x200B;

Pepperidge apes should remember that during one of the Gamestop congressional hearings Vlad 'the Stock Implaler' Tenev mentioned something about late January events falling into five-sigma category, which scientifically speaking corresponds to a p-value, or probability, of 3x10-7, or about 1 in 3.5 million. He also used such a hackneyed expression as a 'black swan' event. Quote from a [Bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-19/gamestop-hearing-robinhood-is-cool-but-is-it-out-of-its-depth):  


>A “black swan” event — made famous by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in a best seller that parsed the role of randomness in finance and life — comes as a surprise, has great impact and later becomes rationalized away as easily explained or predicted. *Many things that appear to be black swans, however, aren’t unforeseeable and are merely classified as such to avoid responsibility for not spotting them ahead of time in the first place*. A “five-sigma event” is a statistical descriptor of something that occurs five standard deviations away from and on either side of the mean in a data set. It describes the odds of something happening, and in five-sigma territory the odds are long.

Categorizing January craze as five sigma is debatable to say the least, because Gamestop shares started to skyrocket and multiply in price long before late January, and it doesn't take a lot of wrinkles to understand that the volatility should likely increase further, requiring additional collateral and somewhat decent risk management. However, I'm not going to discuss Vlad's choice of sacrificing Robbinhood users (disabling buy button) in order to protect the solvency of Robbinhood customers (Citadel and co), because that has been done enough times already, and the North remembers. Rather, Robbinhood example and Vlad's interpretation are provided here as a vivid illustration of the fact which we all feel deep inside: there is just too much risk in the market, it is being too much fucking over-leveraged so that even a fucking retail stock broker may easily get margin-called in a matter of hours. It is especially hilarious, considering the fact that unsophisticated actions of buying and holding a particular stock is enough to fuck the system, making the entire house of cards fall apart. The problem is that when you dive deeper, 2008 seem to be a blessing.

For example, let's start from the easy difficulty, take a look at this chart:

https://preview.redd.it/47plfcth63j71.jpg?width=910&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=90c6f9cfa07676ce106f2f111b12a557f09fd8bc

One of the major indicators of how the leverage is utilized is FINRA's margin statistics from its members (who carry margin accounts for customers), which FINRA publishes every month. There are several points of interest for us on the chart above. The first and the most important one is that margin dept has tripled after previous major bottom in 2009, from about $300 billions to almost $900 bn in 2021. Furthermore, take a look at how MD reaches the peak of $500 bn both in 2000 and 2007, and it's sufficient to send S&P into several years bear market with 50% retrace, as soon as the leveraging trend reverses. Currently, MD is on its way to trilly, the figure has almost doubled compared to 2000 and 2007. Sounds a bit GUHy, doesn't it? Also, looking at the margin debt before the .com bubble, 2007 financial crisis and Covid crash it can be seen that, each time, the margin contraction starts before the crash itself, making MD a leading indicator. And guess what? MD is down 4.3% in July, which is the first major decline in 15 months. Deleveraging is a painful process, but is necessary for markets’ health, and it seem to have already begun.

However, this time it is going to be so much fucking worse. To quote a brilliant mind, u/Criand:  


>2008 never finished. It was can-kicked and the same people who caused the crash have still been running rampant doing the same bullshit in the derivatives market as that market continues to be unregulated. They're profiting off of short-term gains at the risk of killing their institutions and potentially the global economy.

I strongly recommend you reading his informative 2008 post in full, because it is a fascinating financial journey, through which you will learn a lot about how fuk the financial system really is right now, largely because of leverage. Imagine if r/WallStreetBets was a central bank. Fuck, this must be the most spot on metaphor I came up with in my entire life. Actually, it seems now that the entire financial world is one fucking giant WSB right now. And not in the good sense of its reputation.

To quote another brilliant mind, u/peruvian_bull, whose series of posts has been peer-reviewed by an economics professor:  


>The entire derivatives market is HUGE. The BIS estimated the total notional value of the OTC derivatives market to be $640 Trillion in 2019! And that doesn't even include exchange-listed derivatives like most common option contracts. More sober estimates put it somewhere north of $1 Quadrillion. Numbers of this size are hard to wrap your head around - this is equivalent to a million billion, or a thousand trillion- for reference, the US economy is around $22 Trillion and the world economy is estimated to be $88 Trillion - thus the entire world economy could fit into the notional derivatives market 11x over and STILL not reach it. Every single bank is exposed, either directly or indirectly, to this market. For example, Deutsche Bank ALONE has over $47 Trillion in Notional gross exposure - TWICE the size of the entire US Economy!

[Wow](https://preview.redd.it/enhgxe0773j71.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6839e329715d3c47d81048d7c21054b9f218b306)

*Intermediate TL;DR: the financial market is sufficiently levered according to its risk tolerance, and we all know what comes after that:*

This represents what Buffet called “A Time Bomb” in the market - as long as money flows in, the party continues. Once it stops, the Weapons of Financial Destruction are unleashed. As you may remember, something like that happened in 2008, when predatory lending targeting low-income homebuyers, excessive risk-taking by global financial institutions,

[And when I leverage like x1.5, I GUH straight away, so unfair!](https://preview.redd.it/xct7amb273j71.png?width=1619&format=png&auto=webp&s=31b3738202cdc6b3cc7de9692d5b60643a906309)

and the burst of the US housing bubble culminated in a perfect shitstorm. MBSs (Mortgage Backed Securities) tied to American real estate, as well as a vast web of linked to those MBSs CDOs, collapsed in value. As a result, financial institutions worldwide suffered severe damage, the GDP contracted sharply, the unemployment rates rose significantly, pushing millions of people into poverty - largely because some greedy bastards who had too much of financial power based on over-abused leverage and close to zero risk management made all the wrong decisions they could.

Thanks God, they promised not to do that again!

[The scene is from ‘Inside Job’ movie, a bright reminder of what’s going to happen again, soon.](https://reddit.com/link/pa03sf/video/1rflh5jy33j71/player)

\*\*In Tyler’s voice\*\* So that was a fucking lie:

[Sauce: OCC's quarterly report on bank trading and derivaives, Q1 2021](https://preview.redd.it/f9xgxitt73j71.jpg?width=2224&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ccec798f35738ffb3435312c556fcd18646e6bd)

The figures above provide the relatively up-to-date exposure of the the biggest commercial banks towards derivatives. Although, we shouldn’t expect that those numbers allow to calculate somewhat precise leverage ratios, inasmuch as many of these derivative obligations net each other out, rendering the real value of the debt to be a bit more modest (or maybe not, who knows what’s really going on OTC). What is safe to assume, however, is that based on the numbers above, the leverage ratio is still in double digits at least for the biggest and most systemically important banks. From the recent infamous Archegos example, we saw that playing with leverage-amplifying synthetic market instruments (total return swaps in Bill Hwang’s case) is like playing with matches - and it will almost certainly lead to dire consequences at some point in time. Poor Bill just was the first one to run out of luck.

Another important factor to bear in mind, is that those professional financial ANALysts seem to follow a similar risks assessment approach that is used by an average WSB retard buying FDs. No, I’m not kidding, they literally stick to a bit more sophisticated version of a famous postulate: ‘Stonks only go up’. We are talking about VaR, or Value at Risk models. u/peruvian_bull managed to explain this complex stuff in a brilliant way in his series of posts dedicated to the highly probable upcoming financial market fiasco (fascinating reading - in this part of the series, 1987 famous crash is discussed and how derivatives and improper risks assessment exacerbated it):

https://preview.redd.it/zfh3tjyk83j71.jpg?width=1507&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fb308013aac7d7c65f8cbf5130cf7a5d7abf2373

>Even to this day, Regulators, and indeed even financial industry insiders, are completely blind to the risk. OTC Derivatives are essentially unregulated - NO ONE knows the true size of this market. Worse yet, the traders inside the bank are using optimistic versions of the Efficient Market Hypothesis and VaR models to estimate their risk, which comes out to essentially 0 due to the risk models and net exposure hedging. Thus, they pile on more risk every day, ensuring that this problem continues to grow - until the entire system explodes.

  
No wonder, that in such a financial environment as described above, cases like GME would be given a five-sigma label. The best analogy to describe current financial market conditions would be a castle made of sand, when one sea wave of a higher magnitude can easily crash the whole thing into the dirt; or a house of cards, when just one stronger blow of the wind will trigger a chain reaction and demolish it to the fundament. The current status quo is not self-sustainable, and very soon it will become also a not FED-sustainable. The markets have been artificially supported by the money supply expansion for too long, currently resembling a drugs addict, who can’t live without the always following stimulus “dose”. As soon as liquidity dries up for a brief moment (sucked in by some negative beta bad boy), or the FED blinks... I guess, we’ll find out really soon what happens then.

To conclude and sum up the second chapter, quoting u/peruvian_bull again:

>**As long as money keeps flowing into the Casino, the gamblers feel little risk, so no one pulls out. The Fed continues to print money, equity/bond prices continue to rise, and since there’s “no risk” of the underlying falling in value, everyone keeps their money in the pot, and the poker game continues.**  
>  
>**The profits made from derivatives trading are enormous, and any bank that stopped doing this would quickly lose investors, because they would instantly take their capital out and take it to another bank that actually is profitable. It's all a confidence game - as long as everyone is confident, prices keep rising, and the cash keeps pumping in, the party will continue.**

# Chapter III. The Sword of Damocles (and the bet)

  
Well, here comes the party pooper, or it’s more appropriate to say, the party shitter:

https://preview.redd.it/nw7vw0dk93j71.png?width=1860&format=png&auto=webp&s=7add7132ece80231f1451c88ba69ed3edd3878c7

Connecting the dots: when there is too much risk in the system, it becomes less and less sustainable, so that potentially even a short but sudden and intense surge in volatility may demolish the whole house of ~~leverage~~cards. Anything may cause a fatal error in such a system, even an old man’s fart with the sigma of five. In our example however, it’s when crazy retail jumps on the hype train, and buys over-shorted stonk like there’s no tomorrow, things look like this:

* GME shares added more than 500% in less than two days, showing off its negative beta in all glory,
* making VIX volatility index explode more than 60% in a day,
* and injuring SPY badly (sharp decline of about 4% in 21 hours).

That was just a preview.

Late January events are extraordinary, that’s for sure. But, you know, extraordinary things happen too, and it’s plainly stupid not to hedge in such circumstances, as Robbinhood did in this story. That was a vivid example of an extremely poor risk management, prevalent on the financial markets currently. This factor, coupled with the excessive margin exploitation (e.g. a fucking reported triple digits SI, dafuq?), will consequently result in the financial crisis, which is currently on its way (remember, crises love September and October).

After a rather fascinating set of circumstances, GME situation seems to have become the needle to burst the bubble, that’s why big financial boys use all of their dirty tricks, flirting with an illusion of a controllable chaos. However, any manipulation has its end, and it is a double edged sword (of Damocles). The market will punish the bad actors, as it has always done so in the past - and the good guys will be remunerated. Again, GME is not the reason of the upcoming market crash, but rather a trigger, and in the current financial environment anything could work as a substitute. What was that quote from the ‘Butterfly Effect’ movie? Oh,  


>It has been said that something as insignificant as the gases emitted from an anus of an old man can ultimately cause a financial typhoon all around the world...

**Enough words and quotes. This is my bet: GME to thousands in a couple of months, while the new financial crisis unveiling, or I’m not only shaving off my beard (which I wasn’t really afraid of loosing, tbh, as it would grow back in a couple of months) but also this, my real treasure:**

I mean, SPY is cooked. What's outlined on the TA above is a massive bearish formation, ready to push the market off the cliff it has been climbing all this time. In my opinion, that's going to be just the first wave of the nasty downside movement, and a very sharp and painful one. Considering the longer term setup, explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mwevzz/the_big_short_20_why_bears_may_soon_reconsider/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o0fjdb/this_time_its_different/), the technical (as well as fundamentals, as discussed above) conditions resemble the perfect storm brewing. Now, while it's all calm before that storm, enjoy the last sunny and warm days (and, maybe, it's a good idea to fix some profits, dunno). September and October will be fun. Especially for GME with its negative beta.

**TL;DR: My SS thesis and its core idea is more than alive with GME (proven by AMC example), and even though any major price action movement has been suppressed in an attempt to keep things under control by big financial players, the buying pressure is there and it's as strong as it has ever been. The financial system is over-levereged, way more than it was in 2008, and coupled with the industry poor risk assessment standarts ('average WSB retard'-like or worse), it is heading to the next financial crisis (and crashes love autumn). This factor, considering GME's negative beta, will likely trigger the next powerful bull run for GME, sucking in the liquidity from the fearful and already-illiquid markets, resulting in colossal volatility typhoon.

The Volume is Wrong! - GME reported volume has been divided by 10 since January 8th.,"Hiiii Apey frens!!!

I um... I found a thingy. It's speculation based on data, and probably crazy but pretty mind blowing if true.

TL;DR upfront:

They have been hiding GME's volume, dividing it by 10 this whole time. That's why we have record low volumes constantly. The volume isn't dry, it's shy.

\------------------------------------------------

With the TL;DR out of the way, let me tell you what lead me to even do the calculation..

While looking at historical options data, I found something.

I noticed a pattern starting January 8th.

On January 8th the open interest combined for all contracts was 50,614.

3 days later, trading volume shoots up to 144,501,700 shares.

The pattern I noticed is that open interest / volume 3 days later on a price spike is usually *roughly* the same.

Here's some cool tables:

*Disclaimer: It takes me so long to gather this data in this format. Like an hour per date because of the way the API I'm using is set up. If anyone has a faster way to check, by all means check and post validation in the comments or debunk it. But because it happens multiple times, I'm gonna just assume it's roughly the same for the rest because it's not ALL that important, it's just the thing that got me thinking.*

Look at OE / V. That's the combined Open Interest divided by the volume of the jump 3 to 4 days later.

WHY I decided to do that calculation? Idk I was just dividing shit trying to find patterns lmao This seems like one so I ran with it.

Jan 13th it's 28.5. It's on average 2 to 2.5 after that.

Since February, GME has not hit 100M+ volume once. But yet it's had roughly the same OE / V and roughly the same sort of price increases. Swaps and shit causing big jumps. BUT the volume has been consistently low compared to January.

This stuck out as strange to me. It made no sense.

100-150 million volume was normal for a jump before March. Then it just kept acting weird.

The thing that really made me wonder was... How the fuck was GME the most trending stock on Nov 3rd, a magnificent run from 214 to 255, but yet only 11 million volume?

I mean it could just be volume is dry as fuck but... idk..

And so I looked more closely at Jan 8th. The only time OE / V was massive. 28.5.

28.5 compared to the 2.5 average is weird.

Then it hit me.. What if the volume this entire time starting after Jan 8th has been divided by 10?

If you do that, the OE / V lines up closely with Jan 8th's 28.5 number. 1.7 turns to 17. 2.76 turns to 27.6 etc etc, recently 2.25 turns to 22.5. Idk? It looks like it matches.

And if you do that, 11.25M volume looks relatively like a normal jump. 112.58M.

It's just speculation but it really kinda puts things in perspective considering the massive amounts of naked shorts flying around.

That's when I remembered Citadel saying 7.4B and I went to read specifically what they said which was:

**""On January 27th, numerous retail brokerage firms imposed restrictions on the trading of certain “meme stocks” due to capital constraints, liquidity concerns and other commercial reasons. ""**

**""Citadel Securities never requested, intimated, agreed or otherwise sought to limit or to restrict the trading of such securities.    On January 27th, we executed an astonishing 7.4 billion shares on behalf of retail investors. ""**

List of stonkies restricted:

And so Citadel says:

**""During this volatile period, Citadel Securities was the ONLY major market maker that executed buy and sell orders for individual investors without limitations. ""**

To me, what they're saying is there were a bunch of stocks restricted. And **of those stocks restricted**, they executed buy and sell orders without limitations. And the total number of executed shares was **7.4B.** 

They could probably lawyer their way out of it, but that's what they're implying.

But I said to myself **""Self... That means if you add up the volume of all of them, it should be around 7.4B. And if my theory is correct, it's gonna come up short.  And I'm willing to bet if I 10x GME's volume it'll match.""**.

Dead ass I said this to myself right before I set off to calculate the total. My heart pounding wondering if I was right. Or probably because I've been up for too long and need sleep, who knows lmao

But as I kept adding up the shares, it was inching closer. 1B, 3B, 5B.. At this point I'm like well maybe I'm wrong.. It'll probably add up to 7.4B. Oh wel-

**NOPE!**

**6,671,542,157** shares.

**""Holy shit..""** I said.

7.4B - 6,671,542,157 = **728,457,843 missing shares**. DOES NOT COMPUTE. Citadel lieeeeees.

At this point I was like no fucking way...

So I took out GME's number from the calculation.

GME's volume on Jan 27th was 93,396,700.

&#x200B;

6,671,542,157 **-** 93,396,700 = 6,578,145,457

&#x200B;

93,396,700 x 10 =  **933,967,000**

6,578,145,457 + 933,967,000 **= 7,512,112,457**

&#x200B;

Could it be true? What the actual fuck?

It can't be dark pool because on just **one** of the stonkies alone the volume was over 1B on the dark pool.

It makes no sense, they wouldn't execute 6.6B shares on lit exchanges and somehow need to make up 728M on dark pool. It's a small percentage and they're basically bragging about their limitless naked shorting capabilities on lit exchanges so 728M is nothing for them \*SUPPOSEDLY\*

The fact that A. I suspected this actual thing *(10x GME's volume to get to \~7.4B)* would happen and B. This actual thing fucking happened.... leads me to conclude the volume since January 8th has been divided somehow by 10. Everything just lines up too perfectly if you add that factor in.

&#x200B;

Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe there's another explanation. Maybe it's a glitch. Maybe they meant all of retail instead of just the ""such stocks"" they mentioned right before they said 7.4B.

Who knows. But it suuuuuure is a weeeeeeird coincidence that when you 10x GME's volume it's basically what they said they executed.

If I'm wrong, plz don't crucify me LOL I took time to write this and if the pattern holds with me writing DD, this at the very least will spark someone's creative juices and something good will come of it.

Speculation as to why? If this is true? Well for one, 100M volume + huge run ups = FOMO. 

So.. they would not want FOMO which would add more volume they can't handle like in January.

And 2. Let's say randomly 2B shares pop up on volume.. That would be kinda like... yeah naked shorts obviously. And SEC wouldn't be able to pretend they don't know what's going on.

I mean the only way this would be possible is if there was some sort of huge collusion between all the large players so they don't lose all their wealth. And idk that seems ridiculous and conspiracy/tin foil right? ....Right?.....

There definitely is motive to do it, if they have the ability. Which they probably do. Simple calculation. Divide by 10 and lie.

Anyway I got to get some sleep, hope you guys are doing well. No matter the case, GME is MOASS and blablabla HODL!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/qn0jmq/the_volume_is_wrong_gme_reported_volume_has_been/,thabat,2021-11-05 06:54:03,5985,Superstonk
GME Annual Shareholder meeting (AGM) + Recalling the shares,"History of Gamestop hosting  its General Shareholders meeting: 
.
June 10, 2017 
June 26, 2018
June 10, 2019
June 2, 2020


SEC law states that you can announce a share recall before the Annual General Meeting by 60 days. 

If Gamestop is hosting their AGM on June 10, 2021
They are allowed to announce a share recall on April 11, 2021 (Which is a sunday, so it will most likely be announced on Monday, April 12, 2021) 

What a coincidence, the legend DFV has 500 Calls that expire that week (Friday, April 16)!!!!

That glorious  DFV... timing his call after the April 10 earliest date of share recalls....

What about the shares recall? 
When they announce a share recall, they give you a deadline to register

Last year, they recalled the shares on April 10, and the deadline for registry was April 20

It is necessary to recall the shares prior to the meeting by 60 days in order to vote. That means if the total ownership of gamestop exceeds the number of shares existed, the shorters MUST close their positions before the registery deadline! 

April 12 might not be the day they announce the share recall, but it will happen in April. It MUST happen in order to have the annual general shareholder meeting. 

Dont put your hopes on certain dates, I'm just betting on a share recall on april based on the history of data. 
Huge news are brought up during the annual shareholders meeting and we get to participate and vote on important changes (Example: Change of CEO *Wink Wink*) Again, just an example.


See you all at the diamond hands meeting 💎🖐🏼 Please spread the word and make this post more visible.





                 🖍Answering your questions: 🖍

1)What is AGM? 
Annual General Meeting



2) Why must they cover if they recall the share? 

Simply because the ownership of the stock exceeds the number of shares issued by a company. Example: Apes and institution are holding 250 million shares. Only 70 Million exist. They must buy back the synthetic shares they issued and flooded the market with. We determine the price. 

3) Why didnt this happen last year tho? 

The ownership of the stock did not exceed the number of shares issued from the company. Apes and institutions were not interested in GME.


4)What if I own 1 Share? 

Know your rights as a shareholder.   Mark cuban wrote this article on shareholders rights. Even if you own 1 share, you must register once they announce the share recall. Every share matters.

Anyone wanting to read the Mark Cuban blog post, here's a link:

https://blogmaverick.com/2006/04/26/dont-blame-me-im-just-a-stupid-shareholder/amp/?__twitter_impression=true



5) Can you cite a source for the SEC Law recall 60 days?


Sure!

1.5 Notice. The Corporation shall give written or electronic notice of each shareholders’ meeting stating the date, time, and place and, for a special meeting, the purpose(s) for which the meeting is called, not less than ten (10) (unless a greater period of notice is required by law in a particular case) nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the date of the meeting, to each shareholder of record, to the shareholder’s address as it appears on the current record of shareholders of the Corporation.

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000119312516641678/d219877dex32.htm

I Used Microsofts SEC filing as reference, although the rules still apply to all companies. I will try finding GMEs filing from last year and will update you if I find anything specific.


Once a company announces the shareholders meeting, they will provide shareholders with a deadline to register. That is how a stock is recalled. Thus, this section of the article has 100% to do with a share count.


6) Why is it called texas law? That has nothing to do with SEC...


SEC Fort Worth Regional Office is located in Texas. The SEC has more than 10 branches. This particular law has been issued by the SEC branch of texas. SEC laws apply to all companies that are traded publicly in the United states. I just used the microsoft filing as reference. It is reffered to as the texas law due to the law being issue from the SEC Fort Worth Regional Office.

7) IMPORTANT NOTE: 

Not all platforms allow you to participate in voting. 

Etoro is one of those platforms where they do the voting on your behalf.


8) Right, so if  understand this correctly, last year some major shareholders opted out, plus there were not as many fake shares, so a recall/count didn't happen?This year, some of those shareholders (Blackrock) might well want a recall, as well as Retail. That alone might be enough to force shorts to close shares? If so, the next question is, how many of us actually own the shares we think we own? 


Do the various dodgy brokers we are forced to operate through actually assign proper ownership of the shares when we buy them? 

Answer: Yes. Most of the platforms you guys are using are regulated. If they risk breaking such rules they're facing major Lawsuits and being delisted as regulated broker. If the broker you are using is regulated by top teir financial sector, you shouldnt worry. 


9) I would assume a lot of these shares we own are synthetics that need to be covered. Do these synthetics have an associated issuance identifier that matches the real share, wherever the hell that is actually living, presumably in Kens asshole?

Answer: That is not your problem. These assholes flooded the market with synthetic shares? Then they must buy it back before the deadline for the shares recall. Or else they are most likely headed to prison. A share recall is a good identifier to prove our theory of Hedgefunds flooding the market with synthetic shares. They MUST buy it back. Thats why a lot of people are mentioning 1 Million is not a meme, 10M is not a meme, etc. Because YOU set the floor for your shares.



10) How do you register/vote? Is it through your platform? I’m sure there will be more posts as the date approaches, but I personally have no idea how to participate.


Once Gamestop announces the Annual Shareholders Meeting, your brokers duty is to report the number of shares their users have purchased. Then, your broker will email you your voting right if they allow their users to participate in voting. Ask your broker if they allow you to vote, as I have mentioned not all brokers allow their users to vote and vote on their behalf (Example:Etoro) 

A broker can not fake the number of shares their users have purchased, unless you have purchased a CFD share (Contract for difference). Again, you shouldnt worry about your share being real/synthetic. Those that flooded the market with synthetic shares are the ones fucked, not you.



u/the_captain_slog mentioned 

""Even if you recall your shares, there is no guarantee that your broker will locate them in time and you will be given voting rights equal to your ownership interest.

Many brokers follow what is known as post-reconciliation procedures. You'll get a proxy statement from them that says you own 100 shares, for example. They own your shares in street name, so they vote on your behalf - you are just instructing them how to vote for you. They add your shares and votes to the other holders of the stock and ship them all in. If the DTCC says, hey, you did 10,000 votes and should've only had 5,000, they will ""reconcile"" (remove) the extra votes. This is a process known as ""over-voting.""  You will never be notified if your shares are not voted. https://katten.com/Proxy-Vote-Processing-Issues

An SEC roundtable in 2018 showed that out of 183 shareholder meetings studied, 130 had over-votes. https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2018/11/21/what-happened-at-the-secs-proxy-process-roundtable/

Here's a pretty good overview of the general proxy voting process: https://www.niri.org/getattachment/Professional-Development/Webinars/Archived-Webinars/Proxy-Voting-101/NIRI-Webinar-Proxy-Voting-101-021518.pdf



Also, one nit - GME is incorporated under Delaware law (like a lot of corporations) so they'd be following those rules and not Texas."" 

Reply: Gamestop is headquartered in Texas. The SEC 60 days notice for recalling shares applies to *All*  SEC branches and *All* publicly traded companies in the US. A rule that applies to Apple still applies to Gamestop and every other company listed on the NYSE (NewYork Stock Exchange) 



                      🖍Final Thoughts🖍

Knowledge is power. I tried my best to explain the situation in the easiest wording I can. Ignore any typos/grammar mistakes (english is my second language). Feel free to correct me on any information I posted that is wrong, I will edit the post and fix it. We're all trying to learn here! Thank you for the awards and upvotes! An ape with diamond hands and knowledge is indestructible 🦍💎🖐🏼🖍🖍


Also, DFV is a fucking genius. The way he timed his calls expiration is mind blowing. I don't understand how his brain functions but that brilliant bstard is a fucking genius. Im jacked to the titz. Mind blown.

DFV 500 calls - strike $12 - exp: *4/16/2021*

On a side note, if you ordered the SQUEEZEable plush kitty banana, its expected date of delivery is *4/20/21* 


Final Edit: 
This is not an ""IF this happens"" situation. This is a ""WHEN this happens"". Im not betting on a conspiracy theory, Im simply waiting to hear from Gamestop, and we are GUARANTEED to have an annual shareholders meeting. We WILL hear from gamestop.


Example of a company recalling their shares: 
 
Tesla (Which was a long-short squeeze) recalls their shares every July, their AGM is in september.  See a trend here?

GME's Annual General Meeting- Mid July 
Soonest we can hear from them - Mid Ape-ril

Please Don't Play The Face Game...,"The Face Game can be played by four or more people. 

Players must begin the game alone and in absolute darkness.

If any sources of light or observers are present, the game will fail…

But the game itself is simple.

Players stand in a circle, with one player in the center.

The player in the center is called the *Judge.* 

The players who form the circle are called the *Pretenders.* 

In the center of the circle, the Judge spins counterclockwise, while the Pretenders rotate clockwise around them. The players continue to spin until the Judge announces in a loud voice:

*“I wonder, I wonder, whose face will I find?”*

The Pretenders then freeze and take three steps backward, widening the circle. 

The Judge can no longer be sure who–*or what*–is standing where. They must approach the first Pretender and attempt to identify them by touching their face. 

If the Judge touches any part of a Pretender apart from their face–or if a Pretender moves or speaks–the game fails.

A Pretender can sneer, scrunch up their nose, or otherwise manipulate their face to make themselves more difficult to identify.

When the Judge is confident about a Pretender’s identity, the Judge announces loudly:

*“This face belongs to (the Pretender’s full, true name).”* 

If the Judge is incorrect, the Face Game ends. Otherwise, the game continues, and the Judge approaches the next Pretender. 

If the Judge correctly identifies all of the Pretenders, the Judge wins, and the Face Game ends.

If a Pretender successfully deceives the Judge, the Pretenders win, and the Face Game ends.

There is, however, a third possible outcome.

During the Face Game, it is possible that the Judge might touch a face that they are unable to identify, a face that belongs to someone (or *something*) that wasn’t present when the game began: the *Outsider*. 

The Judge must take their time with the face of the Outsider, being sure to touch every part. 

They must not be discouraged or frightened by weeping sores, strange protrusions, or squirming things beneath the Outsider’s flesh. Even if the Outsider bites the Judge, licks them, or makes it skin abrasive, the Judge must continue until they have touched every part of the Outsider’s face. 

The Pretenders must remain in their places. They must not move or speak, regardless of any foul odors, unnatural sounds, or changes in temperature that the Outsider might produce.

When the Judge has completely touched every part of the Outsiders face, they must loudly announce:

*“I do not know who this face belongs to, but surely it is the most beautiful face of all.”* 

The Outsider then disappears, and the Face Game ends. 

However, if the Pretenders move or speak, if the Judge fails to completely touch the Outsider’s face or doesn’t pronounce the game-ending phrase correctly–or if the Outsider successfully impersonates one of the Pretenders–the Outsider wins the Face Game. 

*And what happens if the Outsider wins the Face Game?* 

My best friends and I found out on Halloween Night, 1999. 

*“...light as a feather, stiff as a board…light as a feather, stiff as a board…”* the five of us chanted–but Amy didn’t budge. My fingers hurt; I was starting to sweat in Clara’s stuffy unfinished basement, and I thought that choosing our heaviest friend for the witchy ritual might not have been the best idea. I wanted, *desperately,* for it to work; I think we all did. 

Mostly because now that we were twelve, Halloween had started to seem sort of…*lame.* 

Erica had stolen her brother’s copy of *Scream,* but it hadn’t made us jump and shriek the way we used to. Eating so much candy had made us all feel sick to our stomachs, and the flickering tea candles Kristina had set up felt cliché instead of spooky.

We all wanted that special Halloween magic back, even if it was just for one more night. 

The basement door opened with a creak; we all jumped and let Amy drop.

“Ow!” Amy groaned, clutching her head. Clara’s older sister Holly stood backlit by the rectangle of light at the top of the basement stairs. 

“Are you *still* trying to do that stupid trick?” Holly sneered. “You know it’s fake, right?” Holly was two years older than us, and–according to herself–about *ten* times cooler. Maybe it was just the sweltering basement or my frustration with our disappointing Halloween night, but I suddenly just couldn’t take any more of Holly’s superiority complex.

“Oh, lemme guess!” I snapped “I bet *you* know one that really works, right?” 

How I wish I could take those words back now. Holly’s mouth opened and closed soundlessly a few times; she couldn’t believe that one of her little sister’s friends had *actually* talked back to her. 

“I do!” Holly spat, when her jaw finally started working again, “and I’ll prove it!” She slammed the basement door on her way out, and we could hear Clara’s parents haranguing her upstairs. We all looked at each other and giggled. 

Holly was gone a long time.

“Here.” She stormed down the stairs and shoved a sheet of printed paper into my hands. *The Face Game,* read the header. 

“This isn’t some game you knew about!” I snorted. “You just printed it off from somewhere. Look, the ink’s not even dry!” 

“You’re just too scared to play it! Anyway, I’m going to talk to my boyfriend, so *do not* come upstairs!” Holly shouted over her shoulder, before slamming the door and getting yelled at once again. 

We read through the instructions several times. It didn’t seem complicated, but even as a preteen, I wondered about the Face Game. It seemed so simple, so anonymous. Who had created the Face Game? Why? At the time, I didn’t have any answers.

The five of us stood in a circle, waiting for Clara’s parents to click off the television and go to bed. When the house was finally quiet, we began.

I volunteered to be the Judge.

It had looked easy on paper, but spinning in circles in Clara’s stuffy, pitch-black basement went to my head immediately. I had barely twirled five times when the floor began to feel wobbly beneath my feet… 

“I wonder, I wonder whose face will I find?” I shouted queasily, starting the game.

It had sounded like there were a lot more than just my friends’ footsteps circling around me in the dark, but when I spoke, all sound stopped. Standing dizzily in the complete darkness made me feel like an astronaut from one of the documentaries we watched in school, floating alone in the lightless, hostile void of space. With a shiver, I took a step forward, then another. *Where were my friends?* I held my out in front of me and staggered blindly forward.

When my fingers touched flesh, I nearly shrieked.

*A face.* 

Fortunately, the first one was easy. It was a round face with soft, pudgy features, and if that weren’t enough, there wasn’t a drip of sweat on it. That meant it could only belong to Amy, the girl we’d been trying to lift with our *“spell.”* I felt around her face–just to be sure–then called out:

“This face belongs to Amy Leighann McCade!” 

I heard Amy let out a sigh of relief. No one else spoke. The game would go on.

The next face was bony and twitchy; whoever it was didn’t want to make it easy for me. They wrinkled their nose and lips so much that for a terrifying moment I thought that I was touching the *“Outsider”* described in the rules…but then I realized that whatever I was touching trimmed its eyebrows and used strawberry shampoo. Only one person I knew was such a pain:

“This face belongs to Clara Simmons!” 

*“Wrong!”* Kristina laughed. Sudden footsteps, a banged knee, cursing. Kelsey flipped the lights back on. I was standing in front of *Kristina:* Clara was after her the circle. The darkness had made me more sensitive to smell, I supposed, and besides: I’d figured that only Clara would try to trip me up. I’d forgotten how sneaky Kristina could be. 

My friends–the Pretenders–had won the Face Game. 

I felt my cheeks burning. Holly’s stupid paper-printout game had been more diffuclt than I thought, and I looked and felt like an idiot. I was angry with them, but even more angry with myself.

“Well, since *you* won, Kristina–why don’t you be Judge next?” I challenged her. Kristina just shrugged. I realized that none of the others understand what I was so angry about. They didn’t understand the tension and fear that came with being the Judge, that weird sensation of touching a suddenly-unfamiliar face in the dark…

Before I knew it, the lights clicked off…and we began to spin. 

I don’t know if Kristina had a higher tolerance for dizziness or if she just wanted to show off, but she twirled for what felt like forever. Candy sloshed sickeningly in my stomach, and I wondered what would happen if someone passed out during the Face Game…

“I wonder, I wonder, whose face will I find?” Kristina sighed in a sing-song voice. We froze. After taking three steps back, that feeling was back: the sensation of being alone in the universe. There was nothing to do but wait for hands to touch my face…

I heard shuffling feet. Wiggling. A barely-stifled giggle. 

“This face belongs to…Clara Simmons!” Clara groaned; Kristina moved on. She barely took two minutes to identify the next Pretender: “this face belongs to…Erica Rebekah Moss!” 

Kristina was moving fast–maybe *too* fast. I heard her uncertain footsteps as she nearly walked outside the circle and had to double back, feeling her way through the dark just as I had. 

Suddenly, Kristina gasped. Then, silence. *What was taking her so long?*

*…and when had Clara’s basement gotten so cold?* 

I shivered. If it weren’t for the total darkness, I was sure I would’ve been able to see my breath. 

A foul smell like rotten eggs invaded my nostrils. *Something was wrong.* 

I desperately wanted to ask Kristina what was going on, and yet…

*If a Pretender moves or speaks, the Outsider wins the Face Game.* 

I heard a sick gurgling noise, followed by another, more recognizable sound: Kristina weeping.

“...I…do not know whose face this is…” Kristina sobbed “...but…surely…it is the most beau–*ARGH!*”

I couldn’t take any more. I didn’t care *what* happened after the game ended; it just had to stop. I stumbled forward into the pitch-blackness, feeling for the lightswitch–

I should have slipped on bean bags and candy wrappers, or slammed into the basement furniture. I should have found the stairs–

But the darkness seemed to go on forever.

“...Clara? Kristina?” I asked nervously. No response. It was like my words had been swallowed up. I wrapped my arms around myself against the chill, but it was useless; the cold penetrated all the way to the bone. When I held my jaw to stop my teeth from chattering, I thought for sure I could hear someone screaming–but it felt very far away.

No matter how far I walked forward or backwards, I couldn’t reach the basement wall. I knelt down and touched the floor. Instead of Clara’s carpet, I touched something as cold and smooth as ice. “Is…is anyone there?” I cried. 

From somewhere behind me, I heard a low, rumbling sound that might have been laughter. 

The next thing I knew, I was blind. 

“*Ugh!*” A dark figure surrounded by light shouted down at me. “What are you twerps *doing* down here?! Mom and dad are *pissed!*” I knew that voice: Clara’s older sister Holly, at the top of the stairs once more. My friends were scattered around the basement like broken toys, terrified and exhausted–all except Kristina. 

Kristina stood in the center of the room, her face expressionless. She opened and closed her fingers and toes as if using them for the first time. She wriggled the muscles in her face, as though trying to understand how to move them.

And then she smiled. 

“Your stupid game didn’t work.” Kristina yelled up the stairs. The rest of us looked at each other. It *had* worked…too well. Kristina had touched the Outsider, she should know that better than anyone, and yet–

“Of *course* it didn’t work!” Holly rolled her eyes. “I just printed it out from some message board so you losers wouldn’t bother me while I talked to Brandon.” 

“He doesn’t even like you.” Kristina said flatly. 

“...what?” Holly’s eyes grew wide.

“Why don’t you ask Brandon what he did with Shelly Spicer from Second Period at Alex Hoffeld’s homecoming party?” Kristina sneered. 

“H-how do you know about that?” Holly stammered. “Anyway, Brandon didn’t even go–he told me so!” 

“That wasn’t what he told Shelly. Ask him. You’ll see.” Without another word, Holly slammed the door. We all stared.

“What?” Kristina shrugged, examining her fingernails. “Holly Simmons is a bitch. She deserved it.” 

“Kris…what happened to you?” I asked.

“*Pfft.*” Kristina snorted. “Don’t tell me you’re still talking about that stupid game.”

“Just before…before everything got weird…you found the Outsider, didn’t you? I heard you: *but surely it is the most beautiful face of a–*”

“Don’t tell me you actually *fell* for that!” Kristina threw her head back and laughed. “I was just *messing* with you. You’re still such a *baby!* I mean, none of the rest of you were scared…*right?*”

Kristina looked from face to face. One by one, each of my friends shook their heads. 

I couldn’t believe it. I’d seen how bewildered and frightened they were when the Face Game finally ended…I knew that, like me, they’d been shivering and lost, trapped in that cold, dark *other place…*

I felt betrayed, but I couldn’t blame them. There was a menacing new look in Kristina’s glare–as though something ancient and cruel was staring out from behind her eyes. 

I think, on a deeper level, I already knew the truth: the *real* Kristina was gone forever, trapped in that freezing abyss–and maybe even destined to become an *Outsider* herself.

The thing that had come back inside her shell was something else entirely, an Outsider–and it had no problem turning my friends against me.  We were young, impressionable, and–to be honest–afraid of what Kristina had become.

Throughout the fall and into the winter, Kristina followed me. 

In the whirl of corner leaves as the yellow school bus rounded the corner; just outside my bathroom stall at school; standing in the new-fallen snow outside my bedroom window. 

She never spoke, but the message was clear: *never speak of what you know.* 

Once she was confident of my silence, Kristina–or the thing inside her–got to work on its favorite pastime: destroying the lives of the people around her. Her parents divorced, citing *‘irreconcilable differences’* but I knew the real reason: they wanted  to escape from their daughter. They wanted to escape from the *Outsider.* 

In time, Kristina’s sadistic games drove Kelsey and Erica away. They became her new targets, and the way she teased them throughout high school crossed the line from bullying to torture more than once. Those who stayed close to her weren’t so lucky.

She got Clara hooked on heroin our junior year, and Amy was killed in a car crash when Kristina blackmailed her into driving drunk on Prom night. 

Sometimes it was over quickly, sometimes it dragged on for years, but Kristina *always* wrung every drop of suffering she could from the people around her before throwing them away. 

To her–or *it*–suffering seemed to be a sort of game. 

I usually kept my distance from hometown gossip, but in Kristina’s case, it was like being the spectator to a horrific natural disaster: I just couldn’t look away. In dive bars and beauty salons, I learn of the careers she’d left in ruins, the relationships she’d wrecked, the pain and death that followed her like a black cloud. Eventually, she wound up in prison: given her love of cruel games, manipulation, and control…I’m sure she enjoyed every minute of it. 

I ran into one of the correctional officers who worked in her unit by chance a few years later. His name was Mark; he’d gone to high school with Kristina and I…and, like me, he was now terrified of her. I noticed a cast on his left arm.

“She basically rules the cell block. The inmates are all afraid of her…and so are the guards. You should hear the stories that the cops tell, the ones who arrested  her in the first place. They said she was crawling up the walls like a goddamn spider…and that’s not the worst of it.” We were standing in the aisle of a busy supermarket, but I suddenly felt cold and alone–like I had when we played the Face Game. Mark looked over his shoulder before continuing: “the worst part is how she *manipulates* people. Know what I mean?” I did. I thought of Erica with her head in a high school toilet. Clara with a needle in her arm. Amy’s arm hanging out the door of a car wrapped around a tree. “The other day, we caught her in an empty storage room with some other inmates. All the lights were off…and they were playing some sort of game.” I shivered. Mark went on: “We put her into solitary confinement after that–and solitary breaks everybody. I’ve seen the toughest gangsters and most psychotic killers cry like babies after just a few days of solitary…but not her. Not Kristina. We could see her on the camera, just staring into space…” Mark trailed off. He cleared his throat. “Sorry if I seem a little freaked out by this. It’s just…I was one of the COs who interrupted whatever game they were playing. And when the lights flickered on, I’d swear I saw something dark and horrible standing in the circle with the rest of them…it disappeared right away, and then…well, then I tried to put cuffs on Kristina and she snapped my wrist like a goddamn twig.” He gestured to his arm. “Look, don’t tell many people in town about this, okay? I don’t need everybody thinking I’m scared of a girl from high school.”

But he *was* scared. We both were, especially after I told him *my* side of the story. Mark believed me, and we kept tabs on Kristina as best we could–

But after she got out of prison, the trail went cold. It’s only been a few weeks now, but I’ve noticed a disturbing trend: more and more people seem to be talking about the Face Game.

When my friends and I played the Face Game, it was just some anonymous printout from an online chatroom. Now it seemed to be showing up everywhere: in viral videos, in the conversations of kids walking home from school…Mark even found the rules of the Face Game stapled to a telephone pole near his house. It can only mean one thing: 

The Outsider wearing Kristina’s skin is spreading the word about the Face Game.

Is it trying to bring more of its kind to our world? Or find its way back where it came from?

I don’t have any answers. But when I walk through the streets of my old hometown, looking at the happy expressions of families out for an autumn evening stroll, I hear a singsong voice repeating in my mind:

*“I wonder, I wonder, whose face will I find?”*

"Make GME, not war.","Warm greetings from me to you, honourable intelligent WSB folk. Long time no see, bald beard bet (aka bull-fucking-a-bear) guy here with an update (and not a fin advice).

I know, some of you PermaBulls haven’t been feeling great lately, because SPY gay bears like me have been mercilessly interfering with your anuses on almost a daily basis. Well, in that relation, I have no good news for PB - because 🌈🐻 vanity fair is highly likely to continue, and I fucking warned you about this [300 days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mwevzz/the_big_short_20_why_bears_may_soon_reconsider/)! Therefore, buying puts during pullbacks like the current one looks like a solid strategy to me, as the Big Short 2.0 SPY 2022-3 target is $220. However, I’m not here today to talk about red, but rather I would like to point at the big green dildos candles incoming.

“Butt where’s some good green shit, bald man?” - the question I sense floating in the air.

Lemme be perfectly clear. GameStop is set to RIP (arses), starting today!

[GME daily chart](https://preview.redd.it/eyiok6qba7i81.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=75f49673b175591e2b90f71781210d93d5ae5dd4)

The technical outlook provided above may appear a bit overwhelming from the first glance, but I’ll explain everything in a *sec*.  


&#x200B;

# I. Elliot Waves and Fibo:

https://preview.redd.it/44h7jobja7i81.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=28783785d3c2fc25de11c9b21221d0b1a1d9e535

  
The horizontal 🌈 lines you see on the chart above is the Fibonacci retracement tool, the measurement starting point is applied to April 3rd 2020 low of about three bucks (shorting hedgies surprised Pikachu face type of reversal), and the top point is Jan 27th 2021 inter-day high of about $450; this period constitutes GME phoenix-like reversal and the first chapter of the short squeeze of everything (squeeze your nuts yourself you fucking bot). Just a quick reminder, that Fibo is used by ‘traders (anagram)’ for measuring the potential corrective move, and 0.786 Fibo is a sweet and attractive level to hug and support the 2nd, corrective Elliot Wave - EW (for the in-depth discussion of why 0.786 is the perfect level for the price to touch down during a correction, refer to the Big Short 2.0 linked in the second paragraph of this post). All in all, 78.6% retracement level is one of the strongest support levels for the global bull trends that exist, and GME recent price action is the perfect manifestation of that. Therefore I really doubt that we will go below $100 in the near future.

04|03|20-01|27|21 bullish price action used for initial Fibo measurement, imho, also awesomely corresponds to the first Elliot wave of the global bullish impulse. The rest of 2021 and the beginning of 2022 price action incorporates into corrective EW 2 perfectly, in its turn. This one is characterized by lengthy consolidation around $180 (average) followed by a tasty 0.786 dip. The new-born Feb 2022 uptrend is just the beginning of the fresh 3rd EW intensive bullrun, and let me quote Wikipedia here, on its characteristics:

“Wave three is usually the largest and most powerful wave in a trend. The news is now positive and fundamental analysts start to raise earnings estimates. Prices rise quickly, corrections are short-lived and shallow. Anyone looking to ""get in on a pullback"" will likely miss the boat. As wave three starts, the news is probably still bearish, and most market players remain negative; but by wave three's midpoint, ""the crowd"" will often join the new bullish trend.”

Wave 3 is my favorite EW, and for GME it will be juiiiicy!

  


# II. The year-long resistance and moving averages:

https://preview.redd.it/bmn9exjsa7i81.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=75294d0b4fd86a9ec1746554189201056d8b5138

This one is really interesting. Take a look at two pink resistance lines first. The thinner, straight one is what I originally identified as the main 2021 GME resistance about half a year ago: all of the previous cyclical bull runs (as well as the original January Sneeze breakout) were caught by it and subsequently reversed; three out of four from those cycles resulted in the powerful false breakouts - which illustrates grotesque selling pressure above this trend line (margin call protection squad maybe?). The dramatic reversal and subsequent bearish price action of each cyclical pattern take up to 90% of each cycle, and that automated, algorithms driven nasty pattern is aimed at keeping the broader investors circle uninterested in the asset, while trying to exhaust the existing buyers and shake weak hands. Well, it looks like there are no weak hands left (thanks 0.786 Fibo supportive buying pressure, coming mostly from 💎🙌💎 direct registering shares), so buckle the fuck up, autist, this rocket goes to moon with or without you.

Furthermore, take a look at the thicker, curved pink resistance which is steeper than the one discussed previously - this reflects additional ~~short dick pain~~ selling pressure inserted on the stonk starting last November. This beautiful smooth line covers all of the false breakouts - and it also incorporates the complete EW2 price action, acting as a resistance through Dec21-Jan22 (almoasst on the chart above) and currently (LFG). You may notice on the chart above, that the price is now trapped between pink curved resistance and the red 21 day exponential moving average - which acts as a strong local support for the newly commenced bull trend.

Speaking of moving averages. 21D exponential MA is used by traders for identifying the trend locally. For GME it clearly acted as an intermediate support during the uptrend phase of the cycle morphing into resistance for the bearish phase (check the chart above for sup/res). Now it’s SUP, and flipping sup/res usually last for weeks! 80, 150 and 200 day are major simple moving averages which are used for a longer term trend identification, and those were rejected as supports one by one in Jul, Oct, and Dec 2021 accordingly. Now they act as magnetising resistance levels, begging for the penetration from the downside - if you know what I mean.

The parameters outlined above represent the major resistance zone of $120-$200, breaking through which will shoot the apes into space. Wen break? etaSon:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# III. RSI and cycles:

https://preview.redd.it/bvc5vkcya7i81.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f2d3c1f8816927ab2f56085903bb8234ba3ee310

Futures cycles theory simplified for dummies through TA: check RSI at the bottom, which perfectly structures into the u/W shaped cycles - where peak zones correspond with the quarterly futures rollover dates/periods. Firstly, this RSI trending does not look like normal behavior at all. GG, take a look at this gay bear robo algo pathetic shorting, instead of Porn Hub for once, damn it!

Each time, after that red RSI downtrend completes, we approach quarterly bullrun’s acceleration (purple arrows pointing up). Notice, how Relative Strength Index shoots to its upper gray resistance towards the end of each cycle, and currently we have plenty of RSI upside left. That, in turn, points at the aggressive bullrun in the next couple of trading days. Especially considering that:

# IV. Bonus for tea lovers

https://preview.redd.it/ah3humfdb7i81.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cf7a3505700a404e52abaab03b6a793d9fa5f653

  
GME 4H chart, cup and handle completed LFG Cup and handle reversal formation has just been completed on 4H, just above diamond handed 0.786 Fibo support, which is ultra bullish. Who ordered nuclear sandwich for breakfast: notice, how the shape has been forming in between blue Fib and pink year-long resistance, and how handle is supported by daily 21 EMA - what a goddamn juicy technical picture! All that is left is to FUK!

# V. In conclusion, I came:

https://preview.redd.it/a962znahb7i81.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2ae74eb857443fec2cad246c7e5ff9f8bcd8ebf8

  
**TR;CR: GME is set for one of the strongest breakouts and bullruns since Jan 2021. The price action, which had been suppressed through the entire year, has just bounced off the strongest supports that exist, that is 78.6% retracement level (of the entire bullrun from $3). Furthermore, the stonk is entering Elliot Wave 3, that has to be the most intensive one in the structure. Locally, a juicy cup and handle formation has just been completed, which is set to send the price action to 170-200 range, penetrating and conquering the most important resistance zone. The local price action is further supported by 21 exponential moving average, and the futures cycle completion will also push the price hard in the next couple of trading days. All in all, lets fuk, LG!**

#Preface

##Apes, this one is long.  But the payout is ***W I L D***. 

This is **a 2 part piece** that aims to tie together Citadel's different operations and strategies and present *why* and *how* this ties to $GME.  **It continues into Part 4** (guys I'm sorry I'm a giant fucking tease).  It's not financial advice.
  
I am citing excellent DD from other Apes.  **I’ll give credits in the comments** because tagging them won’t notify them.  Everyone's DD has its own merits but also contains another piece of the puzzle.

So... you ready?

#3.0 Introduction

The price of $GME is artificial.  Prior posts have shown how wholesale Market Makers (MMs) – Citadel and Virtu – have captured a controlling stake of the securities marketplace.  **Citadel’s assets and risk appetite gives them a chokehold on the exchanges, and offers them influence at the heart of the market: prices.  However, by solely supporting so much volume, Citadel is creating functional dependencies which only they can fulfill.  There is no single firm that can compete with their offering and volume – for better or worse.**

&nbsp;

Buckle up. 

***

#3.1: The Throne Room

**Put yourself [there.](https://i.redd.it/a3zj2h6s27q71.jpg)**  You are in the Citadel Securities trading desk with all their tools at your disposal, and your entire career is on the line.  A quote pops on the screen:

* *420 shares of $DOOK at $6.969 – bid*
* Wat do?  
  
***This is where our journey starts.  You are the maestro, and all of Citadel’s actions are like keys on a piano.***

* First you decide the ""where"" of the trade: 
 * exchange/lit venue
 * dark pool
 * internalize

* Then you decide:

 1. *Order type* (venue-restricted)
  * [Order type overview](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/order.asp) | [More](https://www.investopedia.com/trading-order-types-and-processes-4689649)
 * *Price*
  * NBBO limitations – [NBBO](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nbbo.asp) price “goalposts” for trades
  * Bid/ask spread
  * Costs, venue coupons, profit, other factors
 * *Trade framework*
  * Venue responsibilities (i.e. MM obligations)
  * Other limitations (i.e. regulation limits, rule violations, reporting requirements, etc.)
  * Solo order / combo order
 * *Hedging*
  * Best hedge – options or shares, sell/buy, quantity
  * “naked” hedge – not hedge at all ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

* (Note: if the quote is spread across several venues, or if you are sourcing the other side of the trade, then you will be looking at these variables.)
  
* (*This is not an exhaustive list.*)

Obviously, **the goal is to maximize profit.**  The right combination  will let you arrive at the most profit.  Whatever you plan, we'll call that **your play**.  
  
* The job will be to set up a system of plays that generate profit EVERY TIME.  
* But… there’s a catch:  

&nbsp;

You’re doing it at volume.  

&nbsp;
  
*What kind of volume?*

* [WATCH: this is a *fraction of a second for a single ticker* (AMZN):](https://i.redd.it/iuxh7unu2nb71.gif) - [sauce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DvwrmvGdpY)
 * Look at the clock in the video.  This is ***less than one hundredth of a single second for one ticker***.
 * NQEX is Nasdaq exchange.  Remember: Citadel does almost as much volume as the Nasdaq.

The volume an MM deals is *insane*.  
  
**Volume is king**.  
  
***
  
#3.2: The Regicide, I
  
Your opponent is obvious: **risk**. 
  
* And what makes being an MM risky, since they’re only dealing with fractions of a penny per share traded? (if it wasn’t already evident)  
  
**Volume.**  
  
* You can lose a lot of money verrrrry quickly (guh).  
 * To illustrate: there's speculation that Citadel’s entire naked short position in $GME was due to a brief formula “glitch” – yikes. (This anecdote is only speculation, but shows how real the risk is.)  
  
**Citadel views risk as their primary opponent.  Their volume makes it that much riskier.**

* Citadel is in a position where it has volume for ***every second of every day for every ticker it has available to trade.***  It trades after hours, OTC, internationally, not to mention krypto assets...
* Citadel has invested in substantial infrastructure to handle this volume - but it’s only useful if it is profitable.
* Their goal is to create the opposite of risk:  **CONTROL** and **CERTAINTY** (*remember this*).
* Or said another way, it is trying to achieve “not losses”, lol. 

These images speak for themselves: [1](https://i.redd.it/56kqt4eb6ld71.png) | [2](https://i.redd.it/qm5wkbml6ld71.png) | [3](https://i.redd.it/jbg3gxr46ld71.png)  

&nbsp;
    
Something is different about Citdael's risk, however.

* Transaction volume is limited.  So as Citadel takes more and more transactions, it absorbs the risk of that volume,
* and at a certain point, Citadel is no longer assuming only the risks of those transactions...
  
**Citadel is absorbing the risks of the entire market.**

* Do you remember [this image?](https://i.redd.it/idkn9cchpn571.png)  
* The flip side of that massive volume is: ***Citadel is absorbing almost as much risk as every transaction on the Nasdaq.*** 
* Think: ONE COMPANY handling the potential losses of every transaction on the US’s second largest exchange.

&nbsp;
 
**It's as if the entire market is concentrating its risk on a single firm.**

*What could go wrong?*
  
***
  
#3.3: The Royal Navy

*Uhh… so how does Citadel, like, do it?*
  
* There is no simple solution.  They address every risk individually.  
* Citadel has assembled a massive technological infrastructure, piece by piece, to this end.  
  
I anticipate they have systems for objective risks, like:

* *Robust price modeling for every security they trade in*
 * i.e. how likely is a security to change price and by how much
 * ...taking into account TA patterns, Elliot waves (s/o u/possibly6), other factors...
 * (for example, [here is a paper](https://iextrading.com/docs/stoikov_micro-price.pdf) that dlauer linked in one of his posts, a heady read on the considerations that go into pricing models.)

* *Cost-benefit analysis*
 * What is the cost range, variables, upside, and exit target for a given position?
* *Projections and simulations*
 * risk/reward variables
 * impact assessments that consider repercussions

I also expect they have systems for subjective risk (better known as **opposition research**) including:

* *Player modeling*
 * ascertaining another player's positions & interests
* *Strategy mapping*
 * other firms plays based on available market data, insider info, deductive analysis
* *Counter-strategy*
 * Threat analysis – who is in position to undermine Citadel’s plays
 * Attack strategies – how to “combat” opponents of Citadel’s plays

&nbsp;

**Too far?**  

* Here is a revealing [quote from **2007**](https://dealbreaker.com/2007/12/would-you-make-citadel-your-prime-broker):  

 >  One hedge fund manager we spoke with this morning laughed out loud when we asked if he would run his trades through Citadel.  
 > ""***Then again, they seem to know my positions and strategy anyway.*** So why not? Maybe they'll accidentally tip me off,"" he said. [emphasis mine]  
 * (*Note: While this article refers to Citadel’s hedge fund, there has been no statement made that Citadel does not share its information between its various companies.  They have only stated that they do not execute* [trades between companies](https://outline.com/StRbPa))
  
  
**So what does competing against Citadel's technology even look like?**

* Given Citadel’s best-in-class risk assessment, are you really “beating” Citadel in a trade?  Or are you just taking the losing side of a bet? (i.e. absorbing risk Citadel is unwilling to take - a bad bet)
* Also, technology becoming more sophisticated means fewer individuals able to build those kind of systems - a smaller talent pool.

  > *Only a few people out there really have the technical competency to design these features.  Way less than 10.* – [Haim Bodek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haim_Bodek) - [sauce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQJNeQDDHA&t=168s)

* Citadel gains an advantage by cornering the market on talent, depriving the market of people who can build these systems.

**Basically, Citadel's technology is in the business of deterring competition.**  

* Better technology not only allows Citadel to ""beat"" their competition head-to-head in trades, it also allows them to capture more volume – meaning less volume for everyone else.
* This becomes a destructive cycle for competitors:
 * Less volume -> Less revenue potential -> Less attractive to investors/clients -> Less capital to invest -> Less attractive to talent -> Competitive disadvantage -> Less volume captured
* ...and becomes a virtuous cycle for Citadel:
 * More volume -> More revenue potential -> More attractive to investors/clients -> More capital to invest -> More attractive to talent -> Competitive advantage -> More volume captured

Citadel is leveraging their technology to manage risk, but is also preventing other firms from acquiring the assets (capital, infrastructure, intellectual property, personnel) required to compete against them.  
  
And if you haven't noticed, addressing every competitive risk has *one* outcome:  
&nbsp;

>!*A monopoly.*!< 
  
***
  
#3.4: Twin Kingmakers  
  
So, have you figured it out? Did you see what the key ingredients are for winning a trade and beating risk?
  
There are two (*remember these* - and technology addresses both of them):
  
**INFORMATION**  

* All of the modeling & pricing is about getting the RIGHT information – the right risk assessment, the right price, the right timing… 
* …while LOSSES are all about WRONG information -  the timing was wrong, the price was wrong (bitch), the risk assessment was wrong. 
* Whoever has the better actionable information is in position to win.  Every time.  
  
**SPEED**  
  
* Every transaction operates on a “first across the line” system: the first accepted quote wins. 
 * It doesn’t matter if a better quote arrives 1 nanosecond after a transaction is completed. 
* Also - the first across the line IS the information: the winning quote becomes a trade and prints to the tape.  
* So being the fastest to quote can win the transaction (first across the line) AND can bend the information (tape) to your favor before the opposition can react.

&nbsp;

Pretend that you could freeze time.  At that single moment the [quotes in transit from the exchanges are also frozen.](https://i.redd.it/bv8yqzgilud71.png)  
  
If you were positioned at both ends of the quote line, you could gain superior **information**:

* You know where a quote is headed and when it will arrive.
* You know which was the highest/lowest price.
* You also know how a given price will change (up or down).

(This gives you *advance knowledge* for your plays.)

If you could also ACT while time was frozen, you would enjoy superior **speed**.  You could use the above information to:

* Cherry-pick the price/exchange combo that met your goal:
 * Buy at the lowest price / sell at the highest price
 * Use the best exchange (transaction structure, order type, reporting speed, etc.)
 * Benefit from up/down price movements
* But since your actions affected your situation, you could also:
 * Buy/sell shares ahead of demand
 * Change the price to your favor (buying in a way that moves the price higher/lower)
 * Affect opponent’s positions, risk equations, etc.
* ...and so much more!

This is called ***latency arbitrage***, or, profiting off of a delay in information by moving faster than the information travels.  As long as you could move faster than your opponents you would enjoy a severe advantage in the markets ([OODA loop, anyone?](https://fs.blog/2021/03/ooda-loop/)), and…   
  
…you could create **control** and **certainty** in your transactions.  
  
&nbsp;

*Fortunately this doesn’t happen because exchanges are a competitive, level playing field...*  
  
&nbsp;

*...right?*  
  
***
  
#3.5: The Anointers
  
Exchanges are for-profit.  And these days, clients demand more than just a venue.  [A lot more.](https://i.redd.it/db8oemaarzc71.png) 

* It turns out that exchanges now only make a minority of revenues from “exchanging”...
* ...and the majority of their revenues come from related services: [NYSE](https://i.redd.it/53i3oscerzc71.png) | [Nasdaq](https://i.redd.it/p0ow7k7ta3q71.png) 
* So, ""other services"" are exchanges’ primary business now.
   
*Wait… did you just say “exchanging” is no longer the EXCHANGES’ main business?  What are these “other services”?!*  
  
* Let’s take a look.  Hmmm….  
 * NYSE doesn’t really [mention much](https://i.redd.it/ixfb1oom83q71.png)
 * Let’s look at [Nasdaq](https://i.redd.it/99g7b8vgjjp71.png)

*”Colocation"" and ""microwave technology”?  What are those?*

  * [Huh, here’s colocation...](https://i.redd.it/vytcf9sge0d71.png)
  * ...and [microwave technology.](https://i.redd.it/axtvp3bkd0d71.png) – [sauce](https://dailyhodl.com/2020/01/19/algorithmic-trading-from-microwave-technology-to-colocation-and-neural-networks/)
  * Looks like the exchanges are selling *information* – data feeds and real-time information – and *speed* – faster access to transactions.  
  
&nbsp;

*[Holup](https://c.tenor.com/l-ahhNsT778AAAAd/hold-up-tf.gif)… the exchanges are selling INFORMATION and SPEED?!*  

&nbsp;
  
Yes, the NYSE and Nasdaq are selling the ingredients to win transactions because, [guess what makes more money than exchanging?](https://i.redd.it/f8v960e677q71.png)
  
*Whhhh... how can they do that!?  Who are they selling it to!?*  
    
* NYSE does not disclose their client list
* Nasdaq only mentions they don’t have any clients who account for “more than 10% of their revenue” (*…so we can assume one client makes up for 9+% of Nasdaq’s revenue, lol.  Wonder who?*)

But we can figure out some key microwave dish factors.  Let’s do some maths:

* [Here](https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/Wireless_Connectivity_Fees_and_Charges.pdf) is the NYSE price sheet for microwave usage. [Here](https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/content/productsservices/trading/colo/nasdaqcmemicrowavefaqs.pdf) is the one for Nasdaq.
* The top package at NYSE – the US largest exchange – costs **~$0.09 per second** (at 20 trading days/mo).
* That requires **421,200 shares traded @ $0.005 profit per share traded, per day**.
* This is the cost for the fastest speed – not regular “slow” trades (i.e. you need to do enough fast trades to justify your need for speed, lol)

**No, I’m sure it’s a long list of companies that can profit from 400,000+ shares/DAY at** ***extra fast*** **speeds on a** ***single exchange.***

&nbsp;

The gamers here know what this means:

&nbsp;

>!*Exchanges are running trades as “pay to win”*!<  

>!*...selling the ingredients to win trades with - which gives more money to win even more trades with, which gives them more money to win even more...*!<

>!*[here's a visual](https://i.redd.it/p3hpwtfae3q71.png)*!<

&nbsp; 
  
But wait, there’s more!

* Since it is a major source of revenue for them, exchanges know EXACTLY how their customers are using their services.
* So they know how Citadel operates and what they are doing with their systems… 
* …and they know that Citadel – moreso than any other player – has influence in other products and exchanges (it’s literally why they need the microwave technology)…
* …as well as having access to other OTC channels, such as dark pools and ATS’s…
* …and are internalizing transactions at a massive scale. 

That’s one part.  Then, when you remember that the NYSE also...

* Provides Citadel with MM powers that further allows price-affecting activities
* Equips Citadel with 1 of only 3 DMM roles – in exchange for fees – which has [far-reaching powers over securities’ prices, beyond an MM’s](https://i.redd.it/n16pu83yiw571.png)
* ...in addition to selling bulk microwave access to Citadel,

…the whole picture starts coming together.

[Note: this barely touches the subject of high frequency trading (HFT), which there is plenty to [read about](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n6z8rs/recommended_reading/)  (I’ve mentioned him a lot, but I can’t recommend u/dlauer enough.  Check his tweets).  What’s important to note is that the exchanges in some instances make **more money from selling speed/info than from the transaction itself**.  The Nasdaq even mentions in their 10-K under “Conflicts of Interest”  that **it oversees one of the primary channels/standards of data distribution** – WTF.]

#3.6 The Throne Room, II

So that order on the screen:

* *420 shares of $DOOK at $6.969 – bid*
* *Wat do?*

Naturally, you set up a system that profits from latency arbitrage.  You front-run transactions.  You [internalize](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/internalization.asp) as much as possible.  Not only because internalization doesn’t incur exchange costs, but because you can influence the price even more, moving specific transactions either to lit exchanges or off-exchange (OTC) to your advantage.
  
* Most MM transactions have tiny, well-measured risks.  The vast majority of their trades are quickly closed, avoiding exposure.
* The impact of these is also incredibly small: fractions of a penny, either profit or loss.
* However, taken in aggregate, **a volume** of trades (especially at speed) can influence a security's price.
* And since your entire business is tied to the micro-variance in prices, if you can push prices - even in minute ways - you can grow your profits.
* Have I mentioned that MMs can hold their own positions? i(.e. they can hold securities for as long as they want to(.  Holding a position or [delaying a trade](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nrh013/liquidity_providers_and_market_makers_and_how/) for even a few fractions of a second could net even more profit, especially if you are gently directing it in near-undetectable ways.
  
But… 

&nbsp;

...there’s still risk.  

&nbsp;

Other players can still win transactions.  Holding a position exposes you to potential downside.  And Citadel is still exposed to market wide events.  
  
&nbsp;

* *So… what now?*

&nbsp;

[*Soooo.... you ready for the good stuff?*]

***

#3.7 The Subjects  
  
Taking a step back - the “market risks” Citadel still faces are not iMpOSsIbLe unknowns:
  
* The risks are unintentional groupings of trades, buying and selling products at prices and times that Citadel didn’t anticipate.
* Usually the risks are other players blindly acting in lockstep or changing positions:
 * it's banks and brokers, who are following instructions of their large investors
 * or they are responding to the whims of their “retail” client interests.
* Citadel needs to account for these risks. 
 * While they have other ways of keeping track of large investors (***more on that later***)...
 * ...**Citadel has no retail clients.** 

So how can Citadel get ahead of retail trends?
    
&nbsp;
  
Think. 

* If Citadel… 
 * …internalizes more volume than most lit exchanges,
 * controls for risk with sophisticated technology,
 * constantly takes the other side of trades due to MM responsibilities, and
 * handles a volume comparable to the Nasdaq,
* ...then, all that’s missing is a broker.

Maybe, maybe, maybe...

* Citadel could sign up a broker in such a way that...
* ...clients believe they are dealing with the broker...
* ...but are actually interacting with Citadel,...
* who ""acts"" like the market and executes all of the orders.
 * (Citadel could use them as their little ""control bubble"" of retail clients)

**So could Citadel use a broker as a ""cutout"" to access retail clients?**  (Since they already have everything else they need.)

&nbsp;

>!*This is* ***Payment for Order Flow*** (PFOF)!<  
  
>!(But it's more than just paying for clients - read on)!<

&nbsp;

“Payment” means Citadel is paying brokers to route transactions to them, so they “own” the orders. 

* Citadel gets the *transactions themselves* (i.e. is obliged to fulfill), plus the retail information.
 * These transactions have already been ""won"" by the vendor (Citadel)… 
 * …which provides Citadel additional volume, profit, and price control…
 * …and takes yet more market share from the competition, because the PFOF demand never hits the open market (i.e. completely non-competitive) – it can be internalized.

* (And of course, even though it has total control over the orders, Citadel only acts in the best interest of the clients...
 * ...and would never [maximize profit](https://jp.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-probe-exclusive-idUSKCN0Y11CJ)…
 * …at the [expense of the client!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/opphr6/shitadel_caught_delaying_orders/))

**It’s a monopoly in the micro, as Citadel moves toward a monopoly in the macro.** 
  
But it's also *really profitable.*  Citadel discovered that they get much more out of PFOF:

* *Speed:* Citadel gains *entire seconds* of transaction time (remember, they are used to dealing with 1000x less).  Or it can disregard speed altogether, because it has ""won"" the transaction as a foregone conclusion.
 * You or I might not care if our personal transaction took .5 of a second or .8 of a second, or even 2 seconds.  Citadel does.
* *Information:* with enough retail volume, Citadel can anticipate retail trends.  
* *Certainty:* since PFOF uncovers retail behavior, it removes an upstream risk; they’re less likely to get caught off-guard in their plays.
 * PFOF means Citadel can likely anticipate retail *better than their competitors.*
* *Control:* since PFOF orders are not going to the competition, Citadel can exclusively reap the benefits of these transactions - to the disadvantage of the rest of the market.  (Not to mention that it makes hiding other nefarious activity easier... ^^C^F^D )  
  
There are many benefits of PFOF for Citadel.   

&nbsp;
  
But you wanna know what Citadel is ***really*** getting from PFOF?

&nbsp;

>!***Leverage.***!<

&nbsp;

Citadel isn't paying for order flow because it doesn't want to compete, **it's paying for orders so others CAN'T compete.**  

* Citadel “owning” the volume is a foregone conclusion that the competition CAN’T beat them on.
* So competitors won’t have the technology to handle the volume, because there is no volume to take.

***THERE IS. NO. VOLUME. FOR. COMPETITORS.***  Citadel is sucking the air out of the room.  
  
Think about it.  All of the issues apes are having with long wait times for DRS – it’s because of Citadel’s PFOF:

* Brokers are contractually obliged to send trades to Citadel, but
* they are also operationally dependent on Citadel (their systems are integrated with Citadel’s fulfillment),
* and they are also financially dependent on Citadel’s PFOF revenue,
* while there is no competitive replacement available.

It’s like Amazon vs. Sears, where Sears is 30 miles away and everything costs $5 more.  Or the Sears went out of business because everyone was buying from Amazon.

* (don’t mean to hit a sore spot, just an analogy)
  
*But… but surely the brokers can do* ***something?*** *Don’t they have their own trading desks?  Couldn’t they go to Virtu?*

* Why would you go to Virtu if they are a slightly worse offering and are also aligned with Citadel (i.e. exposed to the same risks)?  It’s paying the same for less.
* In house?  You cut back on your trading resources when you signed up for PFOF, so it’s not there anymore.  Because why would you have your own trading infrastructure when Citadel does it better *AND PAYS YOU FOR IT*?
 * (...not to mention that having your own trading desk makes you a [*competitor* to Citadel on exchanges.)](https://c.tenor.com/iI6e0e3gv6cAAAAC/house-of-cards-underwood.gif)
  
&nbsp;  

This is Citadel's gameplan for capturing the transaction market: **creating dependencies.**

* **Brokers** become dependent on Citadel to fulfill the trades (operationally dependent), but ALSO on revenues from PFOF.
* **Prime Brokers** become dependent on product selection and availability via Citadel Connect
* **Exchanges** become dependent on Citadel for their best-in-class MM services
* **Exchanges** become DOUBLY dependent on Citadel for their revenue in ""other services"" (since ""exchanging"" isn't their primary business now)
* **The market** becomes dependent on Citadel's technology to fulfill industry-wide volume
* ...and **countless clients** depend on Citadel simply for transaction execution 

&nbsp;

By securing the volume it has through either PFOF, client dependencies, market dependencies, technology, or exchange relationships, Citadel has achieved a critical mass where...

&nbsp;

Dennis Kelleher captured this reality perfectly in [his congressional testimony:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNhhfTUrU88)

#3.8 Summary

**TL;DR** Citadel has achieved a *de facto* monopoly through market dependencies:

* Citadel alone has the technology and risk management infrastructure to handle its share of market volume.
* Citadel continues to capture market share by playing - and winning - a ""pay to win"" system set up by exchanges, via their exclusive technology and paying for boosts to speed and data.
* Citadel is also expanding its foothold across institutions, via its offerings and patronage,...
* ...or by strong-arming competitors out, either directly with PFOF, or indirectly via scarcity.
* Across the board, exchanges, prime brokers, brokers, and financial clients depend on Citadel either for key revenue or for basic operations including executing trades.
* The market is increasingly exposed to Citadel's risks.  Currently, the financial sector has no answer for what happens if Citadel shuts down.
* Thus, Citadel has created a *de facto* monopoly, or duopoly including Citadel's aligned partner, Virtu.

"I must have got a crayon stuck so far up my nose it impacted my brain.... Today, KenGriffinLies.com is ready and live, with all the content replicated to a blockchain, free from censorship and available to everyone. Fuck you Ken.","Less than 2 weeks ago, I put up a post saying I was going to deploy [KENGRIFFINLIES.COM](https://KENGRIFFINLIES.COM), mainly to annoy that lying Toe-rag Ken Griffin, and put all the content on a blockchain.   


You lot all seemed to like the idea, which surprised the fuck out of me no end, and resulted in **30,000 of you smooth-brained apes** visiting the incredibly basic landing page in the first few hours after i released my [initial post](https://www.reddit.com/r/amcstock/comments/q3yqm9/ive_just_deployed_kengriffinliescom_this_will_be/). 

https://preview.redd.it/ewaocuxuuru71.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=bdd95ee1620389f7242f693cf83b21ceec2b7560

This came as something as a shock, mainly as it meant I might actually have to sack off doing any proper work for a bit, push the green crayon, which was already lodged quite far up my left nostril, even further up until it started impacting my Frontal lobe, and actually do it instead of just being a gobshite on the internet.   


This idea didn't start out life as a well-thought-out, superbly executed plan with a team of highly talented individuals from all walks of life and a shared vision, but it seemed to attract some interesting people who all volunteered to help get it off the ground. **With eternal thanks to all of you wonderful autists, you know who you are.**   


So, thanks to the help of a number of these wrinkle-brains, who managed to keep me from simply going on a bit of an extended bender involving booze, psychedelics and cheap hookers, it actually got done, and the first version has just been released and you can visit it here: [kengriffinlies.com](https://kengriffinlies.com)   


**And yes, we really have set it up so that the content which goes onto the site is replicated onto a blockchain, impervious to attack, censorship resistant, and available to the public for all time.**   


That's a big Fuck Right Off to Kenny. 

Now, bear in mind that this is just the first version. There are some interesting ideas which have been floating around, some of which are absolutely nuts, and some which are really clever, and could actually work, all of them with the end goal of annoying the shit out of our favourite lying bastard mayo-boy.   


But we decided to hold off and just make sure that before we go down this path, that we see if you Apes like the general idea, and actually would like us to do more.  
We decided we just wanted to start by making a place that was dedicated to Ken, which brought some of the best of the existing stuff together with new, fresh content, all of it replicated to the blockchain.   


Remember, this has all happened in about 12 days from start to finish, and there is lots more to do to get it to where we want it to be...but for now, it's enough to see if we're going to actually put more time and energy into building these things out. And it's worth remembering that this isn't a sprint, it's a marathon... Shit that's worthwhile takes time, more than just a few days!   


**WHY DID WE EVEN BOTHER?** 

On our own, individuals aren't able to beat the **giant squid that is Ken**, who has shit tons of money and resources, as well as a compliant media and politicians in his pocket. In fact, most people I speak to have never even heard of Ken Griffin, and that's the way he wants it. He's quite happy to keep the money machine churning in relative anonymity.

I bet the last thing he wants is Joe Normal to start knowing what he's been up to because memes have a way of getting out of hand....and trending on social media.   


I mean, it would be terrible if loads of people suddenly started making kengriffinlies.com, and other sites like it, get good rankings on search engines, and getting seen by the public on billboards, banners trailing from planes and the like... I'm pretty sure he wouldn't like that one bit. So you won't be doing that will you?   


We are early days yet, but there is so much we COULD do, assuming you lot want it. If not, I expect to go back to eating crayons, and watching Pornhub in relative obscurity. Ultimately, it's really up to you apes.

The WALLS are closing in: A comprehensive look at the various ways MOASS is getting nearer and nearer...,"What a week it was last week... I don't know about the rest of you Apes, but the weekend provided me with some well earned rest from the *constant* tit jacking and salivating I have been experiencing in recent days. Perhaps my memory is playing tricks with me, but I honestly don't think there has been a period since this whole saga began that there has been **so much happening** around our beloved stonk, that right NOW!

This post is intended to build on the fine work of u/Mattindeed in his weekend [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/sm1ain/did_you_blink_3_months_of_news_just_happened_all/), that had a brief look at the various pieces of news that came out in the second half of last week. As we wait for the next round to begin on Monday, of what is sure to be more intensive mammary titillating action, I want to go through the various types of **WALLS** that seem to be closing in on the Short Hedgefucks at the moment. Actually I collated this for myself, so that I could get my head around it all, but thought it might be helpful for some of you other Apes as well. So without further ado, let's begin...

&#x200B;

**WALL 1: GameStop-Immutable X-Loopring can trigger MOASS by organic growth**

Of course *the* biggest news of last week! After what felt like aeons, GameStop finally made good on ""actions not words"" by announcing a partnership with Immutable X. Very quickly Apes surmised that in fact it would be a partnership also involving Loopring as well, the full details of which may also be announced imminently.

https://preview.redd.it/fxl1q2r3bbg81.png?width=393&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5ea2e2f4fc451da44fa9aa30760927ec541d4b7

The partnership would enable GameStop, Indomitable X and Loopring to dominate the NFT marketplace for both games and artistic creations. With not just the current size of this industry, but the anticipated future growth within it, it could very well mean that - when accurate price discovery is allowed again - the GME share price will naturally balloon over the next few years. For a great hypothesis on how this could happen organically, see the excellent post by u/Doctorbuddy which conjectures how this could happen as [7 steps](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/sk25bb/ryan_cohen_told_us_to_judge_him_by_his_actions/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share):

*Step 1: Build NFT Marketplace for creators and artists. This was being built for the last 8/9 months or so with Loopring as the Layer 2 protocol. This Marketplace will be a competitor to OpenSea. In early January, they opened this Marketplace up to ""memelords, brands, content creators, and artists"". They recently closed submissions last week. This Marketplace is ready to launch and is done.*

*Step 2: Announce partnership with Immutable and mention Loopring as primary provider. This is the official announcement for their Gaming NFT Marketplace - a marketplace for game developers and gamers to play Ethereum based games and trade in-game NFT assets. This marketplace will use Loopring as the fiat on-ramp / off-ramp and Immutable as the Layer 2 / NFT minting protocols. This marketplace is in development. And announcement for Game Developers and Gamers was made today to apply for a grant on this marketplace - https://nft.gamestop.com/*

*Step 3 (we are here) : Announce the acquirement of Loopring. Daniel Wang, former CEO of Loopring, just stepped down today, the exact day of the GameStop announcement. I believe that Loopring will be getting acquired by GameStop and Loopring will be integrated into the GameStop corporation, with the new CEO, Steve Guo, being named the head of this division. This will allow GameStop to control all future in house Layer 2 developments with their NFT Marketplace and have all creative control for future Layer2 projects.*

*Step 4: Announce the build out of a decentralized exchange using Loopring technology. With Loopring acquired, GameStop will utilize these Layer2 technologies to other business areas. This I think will be one of them.*

*Step 5: Open up the NFT Marketplace for Creators / Artists. This will be available very shortly and I believe it will be opening in Q1 2022.*

*Step 6: Open up the NFT Marketplace for Gamers. This is the Immutable / Loopring / GameStop exchange for gamers and game developers.*

*Step 7: Open up the decentralized exchange using Loopring's technology (later in 2022/2023).*

So how could this lead to MOASS? Well, at some point I believe the price suppression that has been taking place for over a year now will simply become too difficult for the SHFs to continue effectively. With the growth and profits that the above marketplaces can bring to GameStop and their partners, I believe value investors will pile in over time and the share price will start to grow towards a fairer, much more elevated, valuation. When it reaches a certain level, margin calls of the SHFs could ensue so this would be the relatively serene way to trigger MOASS. 

(For those thinking that the Short Hedge Funds, Market Makers and Prime Brokers can just prevent such organic price action from taking place, my counter would be that if they had *total* control over the price then we would already be back down to a single dollar figure. The fact is that the criminal market manipulators can control the game only so much, and that includes both downwards *and* upwards action on the share price. As last January goes to show, when there is enough volume their methods gets stretched to breaking point...and I believe the FOMO created over time - similar to Tesla's run in 2020 to 2021 - would mean MOASS will come at some point as GameStop's share price increases with this particular WALL.)

&#x200B;

**WALL 2: GameStop has the technical means to proivde shareholders with an NFT-based dividend, the issuance of which would trigger MOASS** 

But all these new partnerships could enable far more accelerated paths to MOASS too! The potential ways this could happen were best explained by u/OGBobtheflounder not long after the announcements, in his observation that the Immutable X collaboration is actually with [GME Entertainment, LLC](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/sjtzck/the_immutable_x_licensee_agreement_is_between_gme/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share):

*The part that stuck out to me is that this partnership with Immutable X is not a direct agreement with GameStop Corp. (the parent company whose shares we all own) but rather a license agreement with ""GME Entertainment, LLC"". Now, GME Entertainment, LLC is not a new company or a new name, as they have had this name registered for several years. It seems that the whole NFT division that GameStop has been forming within their company has been doing business under the GME Entertainment name this whole time. So, what's the big deal? There is a juicy line in the agreement on page 3 that caught my eye...*

*""To the extent any change of control occurs (for GME Entertainment, LLC) that results in Licensee no longer being a wholly-owned subsidiary of a publicly traded U.S. company""*

*Uh, but why would that happen? Now, I'm not a lawyer (just a retarded engineer) and this may be absolutely normal legal language, but it seems like an interesting thing to slip in there with everything else in this section. There have been a few theories on what GameStop might one day do in order to help protect the financial interests of its investors, especially once the topic of NFTs and Blockchain came about.*

*GameStop could issue an NFT dividend (similar to Overstock) and use it's non-fungible qualities to force shorts and synthetic shares to close out their positions since they cannot use cash as an equivalent dividend to issue to shareholders who are holding synthetics.*

So why exactly could an NFT dividend issuance lead to MOASS? Well, here is my own post and [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/q6gume/occams_razor_the_simplest_explanation_is_usually/hgbzk4v?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) from a few months ago that explains why this would be catastrophic for short sellers:

https://preview.redd.it/4ymr6masabg81.png?width=707&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea001c9b3b28da5cc95bf32589ea7a6dcef266f1

&#x200B;

**WALL 3: The 10-K filings** ***hinted*** **that a MOASS triggering share recall may be possible, but the partnership could provide the technical means to achieve this too**

u/OGBobtheflounder's post also briefly mentions this potential MOASS trigger, although he does well to note that it is less likely than the others in this list, due to the potential legal barriers involved:

*GameStop could recall it's shares and remove them from the DTCC and reissue them as tokens on the blockchain. This would have the same affect as the NFT dividend, but would result in all sorts of lawsuits and is probably not in the best interest of the company. The language is there in their 10-K filings, though, to go down a path where they pull their shares.*

However the fact that an NFT-based decentralised financial exchange is in the offing does mean that removal of the stock from DTCC/Cede & Co. hands is technically possible, so this cannot be ruled out as a possible extreme measure. Note that share recalls are not carried out by a company's own decision making, but by a shareholder vote. So it is not implausible that a company whose shares are fully DRS-ed, with the vast majority of those held by retail investors who would be only too glad to see the back of the DTCC/Cede & Co., *could* be one where a majority of their shareholders vote to force such an extreme measure in a future Annual Shareholders Meeting...

&#x200B;

**WALL 4: GameStop spins off the NFT division to create a new company, a path which could lead to MOASS by facilitating a full share count/audit**

Finally, u/OGBobtheflounder's post ends on another very juicy possibility:

*GameStop could split off the NFT division of it's company into a new company. The new company would not have to issue shares on the NYSE, but instead could be publicly tradable on the blockchain using NFT tokens (since this is a main part of it's business model). Initial ownership could be distributed to existing shareowners of GME stock via NFT tokens.*

u/Cataclysmic98 wrote about [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/sjz2i3/an_nft_spinoff_for_moass_re_immutable_x_licensee/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) in some detail as well: 

*GameStop could spin off their NFT Marketplace division as a separate company with its own stock, but issued as NFT units'. Shareholders would receive an NFT 'unit(s)' for every $GME share(s) they own. Any market participant that holds a short position in GME would need to provide an NFT 'unit' for their counterfeit shares - which of course they don't have. If the NFT 'unit' is issued by GameStop in such a way that shorts cannot substitute a cash equivalent for the unit offering - the shorts will be forced to cover! R.C.'s 'Checkmate'!*

How could this lead to MOASS being triggered? Well, to issue such tokens to existing shareholders, a proper audit and share count would be necessary in order to generate the shareholders list to whom the tokens would be issued. With the very high likelihood that this proves the existence of a vast volume of synthetic shares, a whole list of MOASS-inducing knock-on effects could ensure. Leaving aside the legal ramifications for Market Makers, SHFs etc, the FOMO buying by itself and the trading volume generated could again lead to a January 2021 level ""sneeze"", and with it the triggering of margin calls.

&#x200B;

**WALL 5: SEC Proposed Rule 87 FR 6652 prevents continued use of Swaps to hold back MOASS**

If you thought all this humongous news from GameStop and their partners is the only bedpost throwing worthy news around, then sadly for Kenny and his cronies there's more. Much, much more...

The title of SEC's Proposed Rule 87 FR 6652 is self-explanatory, in that it is aimed at shutting down a number of methods the criminals have been using to stay in the game over the last year. u/Left-Anxiety-3580 broke this to this sub [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/sk1hyd/only_viewed_133_times_todaythis_document_is/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and I think a number of the comments to that post are very enlightening:

This proposed rule is now open to comments from the public until March 21st, and there is the potential that if it gets passed without radical amendments after that date, the main method the SHFs/MMs/PBs have been using to hide the short interest may well be no longer possible. If you're wondering how they have been doing this, the following diagram in u/Zinko83's [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/qmtt6q/volatility_variance_dispersion_oh_my/) shows how they use these swaps. As per u/Criand's easier-to-understand [summary](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/qvtmxm/clearing_up_some_things_about_options_and_how_it/) of it: *""Open up Variance Swaps to bet on the volatility in the stock, and to use them as insurance against their short position. They then sell a replicating portfolio (it replicates the swap with options) into the market. Doing this hedges against the swap.""*

Should fuckery of this kind not be possible, the SHFs/MMs/PBs lose what has probably mean their main method of hiding their short positions, along with manipulating the price and preventing it from increasing to a level where margin calls could come into effect. Additionally, as u/LasVegasWasFun also [speculated](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/sk4l29/do_we_get_to_see_whats_inside_the_swaps_on_feb/), the first of the changes connected with this rule may be in effect as soon as a week from today:

https://preview.redd.it/paubpbtwibg81.png?width=737&format=png&auto=webp&s=099b24caeee9564f806ce45610af3ebc9952f54a

The very fact that it may be possible to see what volume of Swaps trading has taken place could again have various knock-on effects that lead to MOASS, in my opinion. If as expected this shows massive abuse of these derivatives for the purposes of hiding short positions, not only could there by legal ramifications, but again I think the chances of FOMO buying of the stock would be very high. Once again, the conditions that came into being in January 2021 could very well repeat, due to the prospect of the regulators *finally* taking some action (or at least preparing to take action) post March 21st.

&#x200B;

**WALL 6: SEC and DoJ investigation could lead to SHFs being shut down, their short positions being force closed, and thus potentially leading to the MOASS**

Around the same time as GameStop were making their announcement and the proposed SEC rule above came out, news started to also trickle through about the progress of a Department of Justice (supported by the SEC) probe into how SHFs may be violating securities laws. As per an [article](https://www.ft.com/content/08899017-2994-4990-84e8-4a6efb7c57c6) publised by the Financial Times:

https://preview.redd.it/am1t5fu2bcg81.png?width=713&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bfdd275105cbf8f8679af7d804a65f1ce487f56

There is no telling how long the probe may take, but as per u/alexandrosdimo sharing this news [tweet](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/skips9/umm_what_is_happening_is_this_why_buildings_are/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), the FBI (which is a part of the DoJ) seem to be taking steps to obtain relevant evidence before the storage facilities they are being held in have the possiblity of going up in highly coincidental infernos...

https://preview.redd.it/gdb0tovzbcg81.png?width=736&format=png&auto=webp&s=9aada59e38a6001b002b4e7dd1ac3d9b209b911b

So how could all this trigger MOASS? We know for sure that least a subset of the few dozen (so far) SHFs under investigation have been prominently involved, at one time or another, with the GameStop saga. Be that Melvin Capital, Citron Research or others, the paper trail may lead to them and other firms - including those currently holding short positions in the stock - facing the prospect of being shut down for securities regulation infringements. It may only take one or two to fall, triggering forced closing of positions, to potentially start a domino effect that also affects all the others...and with that the MOASS could be triggered very, very quickly... 

&#x200B;

**WALL 7: Shorting is becoming both difficult to carry out and a LOT more expensive than even a couple of weeks ago**

There have been numerous posts in the last few days about the borrow rate for GameStop stock constantly increasing e.g. [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/shu5qs/update_questrade_borrow_rate_up_to_510_percent/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) post by u/chris2155:

https://preview.redd.it/1bbyal3mfcg81.png?width=713&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5e595fa2d7a61436f9d606010d2a63acc4c2666

Not only that, but it appears that the volume of shares available for short sellers to borrow is also dwindling. For example, this post by u/Myid0810 indicated that even on a major brokerage platform such as that of IBKR, stock available to borrow actually fell to [zero](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/sjnmcl/ibkr_shows_gme_as_not_shortable_been_tracking/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) towards the end of last week:

https://preview.redd.it/mzjjdfo7gcg81.png?width=712&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a3765ce852e2526139922bc152c588583b15467

So why should this matter, and how could it lead to MOASS? Well, here is an excerpt from an [article](https://www.investopedia.com/short-sellers-lose-usd5-05-billion-in-bet-against-gamestop-5097616#:~:text=Due%20to%20the%20lack%20of,a%20prime%20short%20squeeze%20target) on Investopedia that I found from a year ago, in the run-up to the sneeze, that explains why this is very relevant, indeed:

https://preview.redd.it/yy14p1wigcg81.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=3101c16d509cec997bc2013886d1b23aaea49c85

Now we are not yet at that level of borrow rate... But if the shares available to borrow keep falling, then the borrow rate will keep on increasing too. The 5.10% it may have reached in the last few days actually represents a 500%+ increase from what it was just a couple of weeks ago, and should this trend continue then such January 2021 percentages could become a reality the SHFs have to face up to once again to keep their short positions going. And once again, should the one holding GameStop short positions with the least access to capital fail to keep up with these payments, then they could fail a margin call and by that start a MOASS-triggering chain reaction.

&#x200B;

**WALL 8: Utilisation approaching 100% again - something that last happened in January 2021**

This WALL is related to the preceding one, in that 'utilisation' is calculated by the number of shares that end up getting borrowed by short sellers. As per a definition by Ortex, utilisation is:

*""The* *ratio* *between the number of shares on loan across all outstanding loans in the wholesale market and the number of shares available for lending at lending programs. 0% means that no shares have been borrowed or lent at these lending programs;* *100% means that all shares available to borrow or lend at a lending program have, in fact, been lent**. This does not represent the number of shares listed on the exchange that have been lent, because not all listed shares are available for lending; it indicates how much of the supply actually available for lending has been lent.""* 

In their awesome [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/sk0ygr/gme_share_loaning_utilization_is_an_important/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) about how the utilisation rate is now up to around 90%, levels not seen since January 2021, u/kainbeats shows a graphic visualisation of how we are coming out of the ""dip"" for this and getting back to extremely high levels once more:

https://preview.redd.it/cwkbrwwwjcg81.png?width=992&format=png&auto=webp&s=29de33479c2f78ee333d553149ae1fdee53f5ccc

So we are seemingly in the position now where the borrow fee rate is going up and up...but the SHFs are still continuing to borrow a ever shrinking supply of shares out on loan! In that same post, there is a very compelling demonstration of how a sustained high utilisation rate could have a big impact on share price: the big run-up in May that Popcorn experienced (this is not to promote that particular stock, purely to demonstrate how utilisation could have such an effect):

https://preview.redd.it/lv932mktkcg81.png?width=699&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f700d672313cb0a3b1ed7d4e6c7b52a90ba5c1d

I think the third chart here is just brilliant, because it shows a longer historical record of GME utilisation, and I think the assertion that ""utilisation being at 100% could trigger a large share price run-up"" looks more and more convincing based on this:

https://preview.redd.it/ef38wuzglcg81.png?width=987&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ba8361859dfc1bce00322354b65ba26dcf518cf

u/kainbeats goes on to speculate the reasons for why the utilisation rate is increasing once again - I will leave this to you to decide which is more likely to be accurate:

*This can be due to two reasons:*

1. *Investors (generally brokers/funds/institutions) are no longer loaning their shares (unlikely that this suddenly changed after December, although it is possible that large holders recalled shares in preparation for the upcoming votes), or;*
2. *DRS is removing shares from these loanable pools, especially brokers, and is thus ramping up the pressure yet again. As utilization goes higher and higher, it will get more and more difficult to obtain shares to loan and short. And GME may see another sustained price increase, no different than the one leading up to January. Jacked!*

Whatever the reason may be, with the current upward trend in utilisation, it may not be too long before we are back at 100%. If that is the case, then based on the past instances of when this occurred, there is a possibility of another big run-up in price - once again, a potential trigger for the MOASS to launch.

&#x200B;

**WALL 9: Ortex Short Squeeze Signal flared again...**

I am going to finish with a short ~~sweet~~ squeeze (pun intended) [WALL](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/sj1bzn/ortex_short_squeeze_signal_fired_today_everytime/) from u/enfiniti27 about this:

https://preview.redd.it/tsgy7v5dpcg81.png?width=736&format=png&auto=webp&s=499dff914ed04c642ecce014a0ba78eff4cebfe5

If you are wondering what this is, here is a helpful comment from u/Independent-Bend-333's that gives some detail of what this signal is based on:

https://preview.redd.it/8mtdhvu9qcg81.png?width=674&format=png&auto=webp&s=a79aa8334ca20fe0edc1b63f6069a2f343f41a2c

It should also be noted that the algorithm looks at the historical record of past short squeezes, to identify when the conditions make a squeeze on a certain stock likely. The only instance in the recent past when Ortex's signal proved to be incorrect was when GameStop issued additional stock, but otherwise it has had a very high success rate for predicting such moves on even our beloved, idiosyncratic stonk. If we are to take this latest signal flaring at face value, then yet another potential trigger for the inevitable MOASS!

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** There are a huge number of WALLS closing in from various angles to the increasingly powerless Short Hedgefucks. We don't do dates on this sub, but personally I feel like the hay is wet with kerosene and a number of burning matches are just waiting to be dropped any day now. And if one of these WALLS doesn't amount to much, there are so many others just ready to take their place. **I have named nine in this list, but perhaps you Apes can point to WALL Number 10 too?**",https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/smjczz/the_walls_are_closing_in_a_comprehensive_look_at/,Region-Formal,2022-02-07 11:30:25,5345,Superstonk
The Game Will Stop,"**TL;DR: For the past 3 years, Citadel has allowed artificial runs in the GME price, hyped by MSM, only for the price to be tanked and options premiums scooped up by Citadel and friends. Keith Gill \[AKA Roaring Kitty/DFV\] played SHFs by taking advantage of this, not only helping introduce FOMO, bringing the GME price to more vulnerable levels for SHFs, but making enough money to turn the tables against shorts. RC’s strategy is also significantly helping close the walls on shorts. SHFs have been playing a game on retail for years, perpetually delaying FTDs and short closing obligations. We’ve reached a focal point in our journey. The game will stop. MOASS is inevitable.**

**§ 0: Preface**

I would like to thank the community for helping get my account unsuspended by Reddit. It means a lot to me. [After my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1cromz6/were_not_in_moass_territory_yet/), Reddit suspended by account (without any warning or notification), and I had thought that was it. But Reddit unsuspended my account shortly after that highly upvoted post about my account being suspended, so I imagine they backtracked from the backlash. It wasn’t just me that got banned, though. There were apparently others. The Ape that was tracking Kenny’s plane got suspended around the same time as I did. Also, the Ape that posted about me being suspended even received a warning from Reddit a day later (he told me it was the first time he ever got a warning from Reddit). I think Reddit was planning to target certain Apes from the community to control the flow of information here. I don’t think that it’s a coincidence that restrictions on Superstonk and Apes in general have gotten stronger after Reddit’s IPO.

It's prudent to know that [Fidelity and Sequoia Capital have a stake in Reddit now](https://news.crunchbase.com/public/reddit-ipo-biggest-investors-shareholders-rddt-advance-publications/). Sequoia Capital, mind you, invested $1.15 Billion in Citadel Securities in January 2022. Thinking about the future of the community, it would be smart to have some contingency plan if anything were to ever happen to SuperStonk. I know that we have Gangnam Style (it’s been our go-to since 2021), but the problem is that there’s no moderation there, and the flood of comments could inadvertently cause forum sliding, to say the least. Nobody would be able to post DD there without it being buried by thousands of comments flooding the page. Food for thought. Figured I should put that out there.

With that being said, there’s a lot to discuss. The recent developments surrounding GME have completely changed the game, regardless of what happens to the price in the near future.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**§ 1: Citadel’s Fake Run Was Disrupted**

There’s a pattern that I’ve noticed during these GME run ups these past years. Citadel & Co. will load up on calls, then you have some TA indicators lighting up, TA bros and the media start hyping it up as the stock price goes up. Everyone gets excited, then when euphoria is at its peak and everyone is jumping in on calls when the IV is crazy high, SHFs sell calls, buy puts, pull the rug and scoop up options premiums. Rinse and repeat. It seemed like that was going to happen again in May. [If you look at Citadel’s recent 13-F](https://13f.info/13f/000095012324005615-citadel-advisors-llc-q1-2024), on March 31, their call-to-put ratio was 1.536:1. In other words, they had a significantly higher number of calls as opposed to puts.

Now, I should note that these quarterly 13-F’s that get reported to the SEC only show a snapshot of SHF’s calls/puts, not to mention that this is 'only' what’s being reported. There could be options in offshore accounts that we don’t know about. Furthermore, SHFs could significantly increase call or put positions multiple times between their quarterly 13-F’s, and we’d never know. So, do take it with a grain of salt.

Citadel’s last 13-F showed it bet on an increase in GME’s price, but they could’ve gotten loaded up on more calls before the positive media sentiment on GME as well as the run up.

Regardless, here’s a chart to illustrate Citadel’s significant call option report, which was a month before the positive media sentiment on a “possible GME rally” right after:

https://preview.redd.it/qvwqfm2rm45d1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=27205d00829676265b67fc1d2bd1d5326b6ed203

The media was hyping it up, [before](https://imgur.com/a/oftg19y) and [after](https://imgur.com/a/eDtRTi6) DFV came into the picture:

https://preview.redd.it/j1curiasm45d1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=d150b8a36a464424d3cf94a393291475b098b2b4

There were several TA posts on SuperStonk hyping up the rally before DFV joined in. I imagine DFV saw indicators as well and he could turn this run up against the SHFs by joining in and getting in “competitive mode”. I doubt SHFs were anticipating the price going up ‘this’ high. Probably, they were going to have it go to $20-$30 max, but the emergence of DFV certainly did challenge their algorithm. I took the [GME short volume data from the OCC](https://www.theocc.com/market-data/market-data-reports/volume-and-open-interest/stock-loan-volume) and turned it into a graph to better illustrate why SHFs weren’t anticipating this dramatic swing in price. Here’s reported GME short volume from May 6-May 24:

https://preview.redd.it/zcfpxghtm45d1.png?width=665&format=png&auto=webp&s=b478c217b3aa98aea192a7b89705470e3818f395

Went up nearly 6x from May 6. This tells us a couple other things (many OGs know this already). Shorts never closed, and they will keep doubling down until there is no recourse, putting the entire system at risk of collapse.

For those that weren't aware, [the SEC Report on October 2021](https://www.sec.gov/files/staff-report-equity-options-market-struction-conditions-early-2021.pdf) stated that there was no gamma/short squeeze on January 2021 \[pg. 29 of the SEC Report\]:

https://preview.redd.it/j1plp8zum45d1.png?width=805&format=png&auto=webp&s=9aefdcb77d7919ce55c71988fe3cd665478ede06

That was all FOMO. Nobody closed their positions. Sure, a SHF might say they “covered” their position, but that’s very different from closing a position \[see my [Burning Cash DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/v0zrni/burning_cash/) for elaboration\].

So, even when the GME price is at a high level \[past crit. margin levels\] like $50 or $60, it just means that SHFs are having a tougher time controlling the stock, but they will work very hard to regain algorithmic control. Trading halts help a lot \[""[Why SHFs Love Trading Halts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/yt5zfb/this_is_why_shfs_love_trading_halts/)""\].

Here's an analogy: Imagine you’re in a football game, and your team’s losing, so you have the referee halt the game. In the meantime, you call your buddies for some favors. They give you and your team steroids,, then you unhalt the game and start winning. That’s basically what’s happening. SHFs can halt the stock countless times, make some calls, get tens of millions of shares here and there, then unhalt and tank the price. That’s why I find it hard to count on FOMO alone to start MOASS. DFV returning is an extraordinary event, and it certainly brought FOMO, but just look at the price. Before DFV posted on Twitter in May, we were already around $20. We’ve recently had the most upvoted post on SuperStonk ([of all time](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1d6r5vp/gme_yolo_update_june_2_2024/of)), more upvotes than any post 3 years ago when we casually had 50,000+ online users on SuperStonk.

Side note: Reddit is definitely not telling us the accurate number of online users on SuperStonk. I believe it is much higher than what’s being displayed, simply based on the exponential increase in engagement/upvoted posts compared to months ago.

Simply put, the price is still currently under SHF control. We’re still not in MOASS yet, so try to keep a cool head.

CNBC recently reported on the GME price, saying that there could be a gamma squeeze:

https://reddit.com/link/1da7hpe/video/kl201kh0n45d1/player

This makes me a bit suspicious. I have no idea if SHFs still have tons of call options on GME or not, and if they’re planning a rugpull (again), because this volatility can be used as an advantage for them to try to make money via options to keep dragging on MOASS. What I do know for certain is that we’re not in MOASS territory yet.

[My last DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1ahuip4/the_golden_treasure_100_proof_apes_get_paid/), I mentioned another stock that began to squeeze. That stock went from $3 to brokers/SHFs buying them at a price of thousands of dollars per share within minutes, until FINRA/SEC freaked out and issued a U3 Halt, reversing the trades, and now Congress and other entities are working on a resolution and a large settlement this year, but that’s another story.

I have not seen those drastic moves with GME yet. For me to consider that we’re in MOASS, I want to see the S&P 500 tanking at least 20% in a day while GME is going up thousands of dollars per day every minute. The price right now is nothing.

Hedge funds were [documented](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/gVIeitXiZls) buying GME shares at this price back in January 2021:

https://i.redd.it/bn1b3ntzn45d1.gif

$5,124.5 per share in 2021, adjusted for inflation, comes out to $6,149.4 per share. That’s $1,537.35 per share post-split. There was no 25% of the float locked in January 2021, the company turnaround hadn’t started yet. We should be waaaaaaay higher than the price we have now. Way higher. Again, this is still NOT MOASS yet.

Reverting back to my main point here, Citadel’s fake run up was disrupted. There is FOMO, but no doubt SHFs are working extra hard to regain algorithmic control, and they may possibly try to make more money with options manipulation. Despite that, Keith Gill took advantage of this fake run up and made a significant power play that will change the course of GameStop no matter what happens to the price in the short term.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**§ 2: Keith Gill’s Power Play**

https://preview.redd.it/p5y1wuhan45d1.png?width=3092&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bf6314594e9eb5a15acaa0defd7283a7813c0c3

If you know me, you know I’m personally against options. I choose DRS over options any day of the week. This shit gets manipulated so much, and SHFs make bank from options premiums.

DFV is an exception.

Because DFV has accumulated so much wealth, by him turning the tables on SHFs and taking advantage of their fake runs like in May, he can quite literally now make hundreds of millions on his call options every future fake run. Even if MOASS doesn’t happen now, if another run up happens in September or next March, even if its small, because of the massive amount of capital he can leverage, he can literally keep adding hundreds of millions to his net worth ad infinitum, and ‘theoretically’ buy enough GME shares to lock the float himself

https://i.redd.it/q48oavg2o45d1.gif

There are some hurdles there, though, that I should note.

If he owns 5% of GameStop, [he has to file a Schedule 13D/13G](https://www.sec.gov/education/smallbusiness/goingpublic/officersanddirectors), and although he technically won’t be considered an insider yet, he will be subject to several regulations.

If he owns 10% of GameStop, he has to file more forms \[Form 3, 4, or 5\], and he will officially be considered an insider. At that point, he will face a wide range of regulations as well as heavy scrutiny from the SEC. It would be difficult to accumulate more GameStop shares after 10% because of this. Even making livestreams about GameStop may not be possible anymore. If you notice why RC and other insiders are so quiet, there’s a reason for it.

Even without being an insider, he’s already [under an SEC probe](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/gamestop-slides-as-reports-note-sec-options-probe-roaring-kitty-pushback) and being [investigated by the Massachusetts securities regulator](https://www.binance.com/en-NG/square/post/2024-06-05-keith-gill-s-trading-activities-under-investigation-by-massachusetts-securities-regulators-9051786168161) (no doubt they’re afraid of the massive amount of capital he’s garnered which can expedite the float lock process). Insider status would add to the regulatory scrutiny. Not to mention, he might need board approval depending on how many shares he wants to acquire after 10%. Unless he wants to give his brother money to scoop up another 10% of GameStop haha.

In any case, the way he can leverage his ownership through options can allow him to help us lock the float. A conservative estimate would be that he can secure 5-10% of GameStop. That becomes public record through the SEC forms, and the total insider ownership percentage adds up another 5-10%, helping us significantly towards locking the float. Right now, we have about 65% of all GME shares accounted for. If DFV were to secure 10% of GameStop and add to the [total insider ownership percentage](https://www.computershared.net/), it would bump us up to 75% of all shares accounted for, while also helping keep shares away from SHFs for rehypothecation/shorting.

DFV is a very powerful player in this, and I’m glad he likes the stock.

https://i.redd.it/ixmazc6xn45d1.gif

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**§ 3: RC is Closing the Walls**

In addition to DFV’s power play, there was a recent share offering from GameStop. GameStop issued and sold 45 million GME shares, raising [$933.4 million](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-completes-market-equity-offering-program-1):

https://preview.redd.it/chvlrybhn45d1.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7cf85058eb1abe026fefad611834e329029d12a

I know there was some discord between Apes on SuperStonk about whether or not this share offering was a wise decision, but to me, it was a strong decision by RC. If this company had billions in debt or something, I’d see this as debt spiraling, but GameStop has virtually no debt. They cannot go bankrupt; this share offering significantly strengthens their position in the long term. It helps us out tremendously in the long-term as shareholders. Allow me to elaborate with some math.

Prior to the share offering, GameStop had [305,873,200 GME shares outstanding](https://news.gamestop.com/static-files/94ea835e-3253-4e6f-aaac-cdd7c1057f90):

And prior to the share offering, the company had around[$1.08 B in cash](https://news.gamestop.com/static-files/f6d2bbd2-9283-42d1-b55b-28af5128faf9):

https://preview.redd.it/s8r2nz5kn45d1.png?width=766&format=png&auto=webp&s=91c4aa0b69744775deae2c65b7cbbd330f1b989e

If you do the math, prior to the share offering, GameStop's worth, on it’s cash alone, was at around $3.6 per share. That means that SHFs could never take GME under $3.6 per share, it would be technicality impossible. That’s like if someone has a $100 bill, and someone says, “no you have $90, not $100. It’s illogical. The company, on it’s cash/cash equivalents alone, put it at a $3.6 per share minimum limit at that time. That was the lowest price the price could theoretically reach at that time. If SHFs took the GME price under $10, they’d have a problem already. Under $3.6, and GameStop could theoretically lock the float themselves and start MOASS.

The share offering added a significant amount of capital \[over $900 million worth\], that put GameStop’s cash at hand at $2 B.

Yes, there were an extra 45 million shares that got released, and it will slightly hamper progress of locking the float, but in the long-term, this is still good news, because GameStop’s new cash/cash equivalents alone put it at around $5.7 per share minimum, meaning that it would be virtually impossible for SHFs to take the GME price under $5.7 now.

The walls really are closing in on SHFs.

Below I have a chart that illustrates the dilemma SHFs are facing:

https://preview.redd.it/gw4is7pmn45d1.png?width=1296&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d8c618134c63fdb9988672d60b96f12aa63e1aa

I still believe that there’s a critical margin level that SHFs like to keep the price under. I don’t know precisely what that level is \[I just have a general model for you guys\], but I know that as SHFs keep doubling down on shorts, with the borrow rates, increased liabilities, can-kicking, etc., they are ultimately [burning through their cash](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/v0zrni/burning_cash/) to keep the GME price down, meaning that their margin also decreases. With the profits from the S&P 500, as well as call options to hedge the increase of the GME price, I’m sure SHFs can mitigate the damage of the GME price going up like this, but the price being at these levels likely takes it above critical margin levels (SHFs are struggling more with algorithmic control). To avoid MOASS, they’re going to have to bring the price back down to more manageable levels and back to a downwards trend.

On the other hand, they can’t take the price too low. Anything below $10 makes locking the float incredibly easy (only $800 M required to lock the float at $10):

https://preview.redd.it/ic1nl35on45d1.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=7565b3d345fbe86f493b8f468931c50a0fbd667b

I should note that there has been [suspicious activity from the DTCC](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/18d2vuk/this_is_why_drs_numbers_are_stalling/), which leads me to believe the DTCC has been hiding the real number of DRS’ed shares. But regardless, at critical float lock territory ($10), it’s blood in the water for any higher net worth individuals ($100M+) to snatch up large chunks of GME shares which can potentially increase the total insider ownership percentage, not to mention retail taking locates away from brokers.

At $5.7 we now have a hard limit where, it’s virtually impossible to bring GME under now because of how much cash GameStop has. GameStop can lock up the float themselves at that price.

I personally believe RC foresaw fake runs, like in June 2021. Citadel accumulated tons of call options in a basket stock around April in 2021, a stock that later went up around 900% within a few months. That basket stock helped lift GME up as well in June, and RC took the opportunity to issue and sell GME shares at a higher price, which helped GameStop's turnaround. If  MOASS doesn’t happen this month, later down the line, if RC sees an artificial run orchestrated by Citadel and Co. in the future, and if he decides to issue and sell more shares at a higher price in the future, it would raise the hard minimum limit of $5.7 again, just like what RC did recently with the share offering:

https://preview.redd.it/eohm28tpn45d1.png?width=1304&format=png&auto=webp&s=56bdaae3bbc7f85416ca5bc7da8a97422ebf4ddb

Again, the share offering was good for GameStop, and I trust RCEO that he’s making the best decisions for the longevity of the company.

All in all, SHFs are unequivocally trapped in a cycle where they have no choice but to continue to short a company that indisputably cannot go bankrupt. If the price goes up too high, they’ll get margin called and auto liquidated. If the price goes to low, the float gets auto locked and MOASS initiates. The only thing they can do is keep postponing as much as they can until the walls fully close in and we reach the inevitable, because MOASS is and has always been inevitable.

Edit: With the recent news from GameStop of the possibility of selling 75 million shares in the future, I figured I'd add an update here. If GameStop does sell those shares at $40, the hard minimum limit would now exceed $11. SHFs wouldn't be able to take the stock below $11 again, which is remarkable considering the stock was under $11 about a month and a half ago!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1da7hpe/the_game_will_stop/,-einfachman-,2024-06-07 15:36:07,5143,Superstonk
"You’re buying based on gut feeling, selling on gut feeling. Why do you hate money? Technicals 101 for beginners.","**Not a trading advise.**

Hey there folks and congratulations if you haven’t blown up your account last week. Thanks to TA, mine **barely** survived. It is messy out there, making it very difficult to trade. Honestly, if you’re down, that’s understandable because these are not normal conditions. We just had a 12 month flash course on market behavior. What we’ve witnessed in this short time happens in the span of 3+ years, not months.

Bright side is, we learned a lot. Through pain and punishment. Turns out those lessons are the most kept. It’s like we are little puppies.

**So, what do we do?**

We do what seasoned traders have been doing for decades. We understand the basics of charts and practice technical analysis. It’s gonna be a long Sunday read but I promise, it’ll be an eye-opening one for most of you. Don’t worry. Basics are super simple and I won’t confuse you with pattern terminology.

If you’re not using these methods already, this post is going to improve the way you trade exponentially while minimizing losses if your trade begins going south. You'll be able to apply these methods on short and long term positions.

I received a PM from a fellow Redditor yesterday, saying his puts lost half the value. I’m sure those losses would not have been this big if TA was involved. We will get it back my dude. Read on.

**Resistance and support**. Two simple, magical words we’re going to cover today.

You’re gonna love the story behind this trade. Perfect example of how powerful technical analysis can be. Below is a **$7K buy-in, 0tde SPY 390 call** I traded on Friday. One hundred percent based on a known pattern.

I'd like for you to pay attention to time of entrance (**at support**) and exit (**at resistance**) then match those with order execution times which you will find on top.

https://preview.redd.it/d2nrriswrgo61.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=78703c09cfc24458b1d63ddde0c022038dd1f72f

**Back story**. Folks, I can't make this shit up if I want to. I'm two inches away from my screen, glued. Watching green candles pile up over support, printing...On the way to 390 resistance. I know if it breaks, we're going 391 easy..Last I saw was 389...Goddam power flickered, caused a reset on my modem. Panic sunk in.

About 45 seconds later, connection came back. I remember I kept saying please be above 390...please be above 390....I knew as a fact, when it hits that major resistance at 390, there's a fat chance of rejection, sending my greens to red in matter of fifteen seconds.

I saw 390.12 on screen. Smashed sell. Could've been a good trade gone wrong. My original plan was to sell half at resistance and sell the other half after a possible break out. Slightly above 391, those contracts were going for $1.50 per.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d0f493b8sgo61.jpg?width=519&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=61db8ae9c9f115ae33f5aacfbfd8f24e7cc3ddda

Let’s step away from day trading, apply support and resistance basics on longer term charts. After all, you need to be mentally unstable in some way to even consider day trading.

We’re gonna take General Electric as example. Starting with it’s 6 month chart, then zoom into weekly.

On **October 10th 2018**, GE closed at what seems to be a random, insignificant price. $13.28.

On **February 12th 2020**, it hit $13.26. Failing to close above $13.30 once again. Think about it. After millions of trading volume and after 16 months, it touched the same number and traded down the following days. Crazy accuracy, couple cents.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3tumqvxssgo61.jpg?width=1532&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=06512087a5ea457dabb354960c24c5d548f495e2

Clearly, what seemed to be chaotic, random price action is not chaotic and random. It follows rules and order of it's own. Just like everything else around us.

Stay with me.

**Drawing bearish and bullish channels**

Here's the GE weekly chart. Each candle represents one hour.

https://preview.redd.it/pwxrsx91ugo61.jpg?width=1532&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d0b6361605df5fe66cfdac3d6c6cbe2c15b1a44b

Super simplified. You take the bottom of the **lowest candle** (**A**) and draw a line until it touches the bottom part of another candle that's trending up **(B).**

Now, we repeat that on top portion. This time, starting a line at the top of candle **(C)** and ending at another candle that is trending up **(D).** Bullish channel is complete.

Using same principals, you can also draw a bearish channel. In that case, instead of pointing up, channel will be pointing down.

Next, we’re going to add to our chart what’s proven to be the resistance at $13.2x. Purple horizontal line.

Guess what price GE closed on Friday. 🤯

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ssi2kllbvgo61.jpg?width=1529&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6e6ac7bbb85f40bd35a4232c794b39f8f4d54cfc

**So, buying short expiry puts Monday on GE is free money? It failed to break resistance again and again.**

No. Analyze the chart below. Area I highlighted shows it actually did break the resistance intraday and held all the way to closing bell. There’s a big possibility that resistance is now a potential support. What we’re seeing on the highlighted portion could be the back test of said support, closing at $13.2x and not below it.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kma6obvoxgo61.jpg?width=1529&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a7be213dc070bc178a35316600bfa84a8f77ea4

&#x200B;

**As a case study, what do we look for Monday eod?**

We look for confirmation. If we see a strong green candle close above $13.50, in my book that’s a long buy (calls). Likely 13.2x resistance becoming support.

If we see a strong red candle finish below 13, breaking down our bullish channel, that signals resistance held once again and it will most likely continue to go down, once again. Puts galore.

**Here’s the part that matters for you the most.**

Do not buy calls near major resistance. Period. Buy the confirmed support. Sell the confirmed resistance.

We see paper handing comments all the time. “If I were to hold two more days, I could’ve doubled my money”.

Why would you sell when you see green candles making higher highs inside a bullish channel? Sell when it’s close to resistance.

**What about red candles inside the channel?** 

It's okay. Take a look back at the **0tde SPY 390c** chart. If I were to see red candles getting close to support, I would’ve sold and worst case scenario lose 10-15%.

**Buy at support, sell at resistance. Buy at support, sell at resistance and don’t look back.**

Apply these principals to your weeks, months out expiry contracts. Pull charts that each candle represents 4 hours minimum, one day candles ideally. TA is much easier and accurate when it's based on longer time frames. **I'm telling ya, damn thing closed at 13.2x two years ago!**

**Minimizing losses when trade goes south.**

This is the hardest part to execute. Denial, hope, what ifs... I lost $24K two weeks ago by not practicing what I'm about to preach.

I added red candles on our GE Chart to simulate a support break. Each candle represents four hours. Take a look. 

https://preview.redd.it/hzjczrif3ho61.jpg?width=1529&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8d1495016c42c920d0cf0754011f7d8a142cb5e6

At this point, it's pretty much gg. Even though we see a green candle at the end, due to time decay, calls are destroyed. Basically, it needs 3 perfect green candles just to get back inside and 3 more candles to start trending up in the channel. 4 hour candles, by the time that happens, 30-50% poofed. In this scenario, I bet bears would buy puts at first sight of support break which I wouldn't blame and definitely participate.

**I'd like to point this out again. Some charts I showed you guys as examples are short time-framed. You're better off applying these basics on charts that each candle represents one day, assuming your position is not expiring in 48 hours. Remember this as beginners, longer expiration, more data, better TA. More gains, less losses.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I’m anxious to see how next week is going to play out. We’re stuck, yo-yoing between support and resistance on pretty much all indexes and big caps. It’s simply not possible for me as an apprentice trader to speculate.

What I know is this. I’m not touching TSLA. I’m not touching AAPL or SPY or QQQ or any ticker that has been chopping up and down between support and resistance. Bunch of noise. Time decay. Not good for option contracts.

I want to see resistance break and hold for calls.

I want to see support fail for puts.

Don't know about you but I like my money. Not going to close my eyes, open a position and hope for the best. Buying based on gut feeling, selling on gut feeling. That’s gambling not trading.

I get the biggest kick when I see my people after Friday close saying, “Shit...What am I gonna do now for 48 hours?”

Well sir...You pull out crayons, draw some lines, look for opportunities. Add more layers to charts. Moving averages, bullish cross overs, RSI...It’s a treasure hunt.

This is the way.

I want to highlight one more player here because it seems like Ken Griffin is his idol.

HAP Trading LLC with Harsh Padia, with an gigantic retarded position of 1,279,700 shares in puts. Why is there a connection?

Now if you have made it till here, congratulations.

I have a challenge for you. Pick a stock where Citadel has a major position. Now remember the names I posted above. When you see that Citadel is long, check what side the above are on. Are they betting the same way or against?

TLDR? 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 A lot of speculation. A lot of yada yada. I like crayons, especially the green ones because they are healthier.

Real TLDR: Coincidentally, most HFs short are from Chicago and have ties to Citadel.

"Complied so much on a test, it stopped evil boss from profiling employees","**UPDATE AT BOTTOM**

**TLDR I ruined my boss’s personality test he pretended would be anonymous but we knew he was going to use it to profile employees he didn’t like.**

Story: Had an evil middle manager boss who eventually lost 1/3 of the team in under three months. I had been there longer than him, before his position was built out. He was a really gross one, like psychological abuse and also openly commented on a 16 year old celebrity being “hot” when was 36.

Anyway, when he was onboarded, he pretty quickly assessed which employees he couldn’t bully and started trying to make our lives harder.

He started doing some “anonymous” reviews and tests. Not surprisingly, some anonymous feedback was super negative for the people on his shit list even if we were high performing or project leads.

I finally had enough of attempting to talk it out head on. He always denied everything and even once actually asked me if I was on drugs (wtf) during a 1:1.

This was / is a HUGELY FAMOUS tech company.

Anyway, he decided it was time for another round of anonymous testing. This time a personality test.

I answered every question imagining I was him. Every single one.

To nobody’s surprise he was like “surprise we are going to all reveal and see which result we have on the screen now yay!”

I matched him perfectly. The only one. He got the absolute psychopath result but it also says like “entrepreneur and celebrity” so he would have been thrilled but-

He knew we were very different, yet somehow we had the exact same result. Out of like 20+ possibilities. When he pulled up the results on screen his face dropped. He stared directly at me, immediately breaking the character who was excited for sharing the “secret” results.

I watched him choke down his anger as he pretended to go down the list, now unprepared. Every other sentence out of his mouth suddenly was how unreliable these tests can be and that “you never know.”

As he dug his hole deeper, explaining backwards regarding this time wasting team wide meeting for his stupid exercise originally intended to single out some folks based upon a personality test, I finally found my opportunity. I smiled at him.

I smiled with eye contact.

No words, everything was said there.

I watched him die inside and he still had to fill 25 minutes of his stupid meeting or call it off.

I have another malicious compliance story about him (he was an absolute clown, I bet I have more if I think harder) but this is my fave quiet little moment where I ruined his total concept of self in one second by doing exactly what asked of me: waste my time to take his stupid personality test.

(ETA typos)

ETA 2 I may have joyfully shouted “yay \[boss name \] !!!! We’re twins!” when he pulled up the results.

**UPDATE**

Wow, hi! Didn’t expect anyone to read this! I haven’t been good at responding because I have movers arriving tomorrow and have been packing boxes. I wrote this pretty poorly after a couple exhausted beers before bed. Sorry for any confusion, I see some questions in comments.

Yes, he had us all take this personality test so that we could “reflect upon our strengths and weaknesses for personal growth” or something like that. But then he had a meeting where all the results were shared with the team. He was previously a Google manager, which (at the time) was known for churning out really toxic management. He was able to take a tight knit team and start pitting us against each other. He didn’t like the ones who wouldn’t participate in the social politics or jump bc when he said jump. He eventually lost 5 of us in a 3 month window.

Reasoning with him wouldn’t work. We tried.

I have another Malicious Compliance story about him, since some asked in comments.

**SECOND STORY:**

Our company always had a giant rager of a holiday party at the end of the year: renting multi story concert spaces with DJs, live band, celebrities, top shelf liquor, etc. However, he wanted us to also have a team celebration at the end of the day before our winter break. For some reason, I was tasked with this (I was working on a data trend and heuristics project so very weird I was put on party planning instead of an admin).

But, I love holiday and I loved my team so I was excited… Until he had his meeting with me about it. He gave me a tiny budget, a list of things I was not allowed to do for the party, and most importantly I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO SPEND ANY BUDGET MONEY FOR ALCOHOL. I was shocked. I asked if the beer fridge at work was what we were expected to use, since the company had contracted merchants that kept us well stocked. He said I also wasn’t allowed to use that and I wasn’t allowed to buy alcohol for the party.

I felt like he had done all this to set me up to have a failure of a party. Instead, I showed some other team members and they were also shocked by this list. We made a plan.

Well, I get this party all set up and it is about to get fun.

Boss shows up with bags in his hands and looks at the spread. He says in front of everyone, “OP, did you actually forget the drinks? Well, good thing I brought all this!” And triumphantly puts his bags of alcohol on the table.

But then I’m like, “No, you told me I wasn’t allowed to buy drinks.”

He pretended he would NEVER do that.

And then I said, “so, I didn’t. THEY did.” And pointed to a whole bunch of drinks the rest of the team was pulling out. He realized that not only would he not get to be the hero but that everyone involved had also seen his horrible list. Deer in headlights moment.

The cherry is we had a Secret Santa where I paired all the choices. I made sure I got him for my gift giving, so we open the gifts and I had gifted him a really nice flight of three high end gins (his favorite). My attention to detail and kindness towards him obviously made him so uncomfortable after what he just tried to pull. He looked so guilty and unable to enjoy it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/1cexi96/complied_so_much_on_a_test_it_stopped_evil_boss/,woolen_goose,2024-04-28 09:10:27,5020,MaliciousCompliance
I Trained Crows To Bring Me Quarters,"In college, I struggled to make ends meet.  Most of my meals consisted nearly entirely of ramen noodles, garnished with a scrambled egg if my finances were stronger than usual, combined with the weekly splurge of a candy bar and soda each Friday.  I worked a part time job, but city rent was expensive, my classes were too tough to work more than twenty hours a week, and my parents had cut me off the year before.

I was desperate, searching for any solution to bring in spare cash.  And eventually I found one.

It started as a joke among my friends.

""You know, Tony.""  Said one of my room mates, as I poured a sad portion of noodles and half a spice pack into boiling water, ""Even the pigeons in this city have better meals than you do.""

""Meals?""  Countered another one of my room mate, laughing, ""Hell, I bet they even have higher *savings*  in their bank accounts than him.""

They laughed, and I ate my soup with a frown.  But the idea stuck in my head, and that night I lay awake, pondering.

I'd often seen picked up spare change on the sidewalk on the way to class- nothing huge, a penny here, a dime there, maybe a quarter if I was lucky.  But that was just a small portion of the city- from end to end, there was likely a small fortune hidden in the labrynth, small rewards gleaming from cracks in the sidewalk and among the weeds.  I didn't have time to retrieve them, but *someone* did.

And that someone was test subject number one: Jeffrey the crow.

I'd made friends with Jeffrey the year before as he hobbled outside my apartment, pecking for food along the street.  His beady eyes had squinted at me as I walked to class, following me as I ate a granola bar for breakfast, a splurge I could justify since I had worked an extra hour that week.  

""Caw,""  He cried, flapping his wings to flutter just past my head to land on the path in front of me, ""Caw!"" 

""Get,""  I said, clutching the granola bar tight and trying to side step him.

His head tilted as he shuffled to stand directly in me and he cawed again. Expectant.  Waiting for me to pay the toll to use *his* path.

So I left him a tiny piece of the bar, and continued walking.  And Jeffrey never forgot my gift.

Every morning he waited for me outside and we developed a relationship, a one way tribute where I would share a crumb, a noodle, or some other minute piece of food on my way to class.  And over time, Jeffrey grew on me- plus, I realized just how smart Jeffrey could be for a bird.  For instance, after a month he learned I never left my apartment on weekends, so he stopped showing up outside my door on those days.  And after two months, he started giving me trinkets in exchange for the bits of food.

They were always small- a bit of string, a button, maybe a hair tie.  But every so often, maybe once every two weeks, Jeffrey would bring me a coin.  And now, with the idea fresh in my head, I'd decided to capitalize on that.

So every morning Jeffrey brought me a coin, I gave him twice as much food, plus a raisin which were his favorite treat.  For two months, Jeffrey failed to realize the trend, instead complaining on the days where he received his normal portions.  Then, on the third month, something clicked. And Jeffrey only brought me coins from that day forward.

At first, it was only amusing.  Using my collegiate level math skills, I calculated that Jeffrey was contributing about 60 cents per week on average to my net worth.  Enough to bolster my diet with two to three bananas a week.

But Jeffrey had friend crows, ones that had watched our interactions from the street but never approached.  And eventually, they too learned the pattern, until by the time I graduated twelve crows brought me presents each morning, a whopping $7.2 a week, equivalent to just over a pound of bacon at the store.  It became a running joke among my room mates, but their eyes still widened in awe each morning as the crows queued up each morning bearing gifts.

I was sad to have ended my project when I graduated- it had been fun, but I'd landed a job at a plant six hours north of my college, and this job brought home far more bacon than crows could.  So I packed my belongings into my car, feeding Jeffrey one last time as I prepared to move into my new apartment.  He squinted his eyes and hopped closer as I started the engine, and I frowned, sad to see him go.

So on a whim, I took Jeffrey with me.

He didn't seem to mind the ride, especially the boiled peanuts I fed him from the gas station at our first stop.  And he took a particular interest in the heating vents,fanning his wings out to absorb their warmth.

Civilization drifted away as we drove- less and less buildings appearing until we were deep in the countryside, forests taking over where I was used to streets.  And on arrival I released Jeffrey from my car as I unpacked into my new place, watching him hop after me with each trip until he eventually grew bored and fluttered off.

Each morning he still met me, quickly growing used to my schedule, and still bringing coins in exchange for breakfast.  And the other crows in the area were observant to this outsider, watching our exchange, until only ten days in they too started finding coins for me.  I smiled- it looked like I wasn't going to leave my project behind after all.

But each day, less coins showed up at my doorstep- in the countryside, there were far fewer coins to be found.  And Jeffrey started bringing other objects again, nudging them towards me for food, until six weeks in there was no spare change left to be found.  I felt bad for him, having drawn him away from his home, so I still paid him in full- two peanuts for each item.  Though now there were twelve crows that showed up at my door, and the number was growing each day.

And then, one day, Jeffrey brought me something different.  Standing on the path to my car, he dropped something small and white onto the ground.  Something hard that bounced, that made the hair on my neck raise as I recognized it.

A tooth.  More precisely, a molar- what looked to be a *human* molar.

""No, Jeffrey,""  I said, stepping backwards and pulling a quarter from my pocket, ""You have to bring me quarters.  Not... not this.""

""Caw.""  He said, insistent, and flapping his wings.  He tilted his head as I walked to my car, picking the molar back up and landing on the hood.  ""Caw.""

With a soft *tink* he dropped it on the metal, scratching at it, his eyes narrowed.  Swallowing, I reached forward and grabbed it through my mittens, then handed him a peanut out of guilt.  I suppose I should have expected him to bring something like this every once and a while, and I put the thought into the back of my head.

But the other crows had been watching the transaction.  And by the end of the next week, their numbers had reached two dozen.

Every morning they flocked to me as I waded through them, cawing and flapping, each searching for a reward.  And each with something new in their beaks.  They dropped it to the ground as I bit my lip, watching the small white objects come to rest on the concrete.

Teeth.  Twenty four of them, one for each crow.

And every day, they brought more.  Even after I stopped rewarding them they continued to show up on my door step, dropping the teeth in a mound, their eyes angry as I refused to give them payment but instead swept the teeth under my porch. Other crows still picked up on their behavior, and their number still grew larger as more teeth would be deposited. 

It's been three months since Jeffrey brought the first tooth.  I don't know where they find them, or how they can be so plentiful.  I don't want to know, because wherever they are getting them from, it must be nearby. 

But what I do know is that I now have five pounds of human molars under my porch.

**Should I sue my girlfriend for selling my stuff**

[Original Post](https://www.rareddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/qbr43e/should_i_sue_my_girlfriend_for_selling_my_stuff/)  **Oct 20, 2021** 

We are both in our early twenties and have been together for 3 years. It has been 2 months since we moved in together. When I was a teenager, I was obsessed with collecting pokemon cards; I had over 5000 cards in my collection. A lot of them are very crappy, worth 0.5c to $3, but some are worth up to 250$. Personally, I never intended to sell them or at least not in the near future. My girlfriend gave away my entire collection to her cousin 1 month ago without asking me since he asked her if he could have them when he visited us. She gave them away, believing that since I'm an adult now, I won't need them. As I was cleaning my room a few hours ago, I realized my collection box was missing and I went crazy looking for it. An hour later she came home after running some errands and told me what she did. I told her to get all of them back, and she has refused because it would be humiliating for her. What should I do? I have a recording of her confessing to it so I can easily get compensated for it in court, but I'm assuming that will effectively end the relationship. Though I love her a lot, I believe I would rather have my cards. It doesn't seem right to sue her for this, but I don't know how I can recover my collection. If there is a less aggressive way to handle this, please let me know. Advice? 

**RELEVANT COMMENTS** 

**OOP** 

>Edit: She gave them all away for 10$ 

**HGTAW** 

>>Do you have an estimate or the total value? 

**OOP** 

>>>5-5.5k in today's value 

**~** 

**Yugen903** 

>I’d agree this is a dealbreaker. What an ass. She’s more concerned with her EGO than fixing her mistake! Yes I saw he refused but she did not try hard enough. 

>HAS SHE EVEN APOLOGIZED? 

**DiscombobulatedTill** 

>>Bet she kept the $10 too. 

>>As for the cousin what an asshole. Obviously it runs in the family. 

>>OP I guess you have to go over and explain the collection wasn't hers to give or sell. How snotty you have to get depends on what they do about it I guess. 

>>Also most likely you'll have to give that snotty kid $10. 

>>Edited to say you will probably have to take your gf to small claims court since she doesn't want to embarrass herself. 

**~** 

**Princessss_xo** 

>Please update with the decision you made. 

**OOP** 

>>Defo contacting the police because apparently, I'm a manchild with ego problems who just wants to humiliate his GF in front of her family members. Like what. 

**~** 

**Vex08** 

>No you shouldn't sue your girlfriend. It seems like you are ready to break up over this, just insist on getting your cards back. Talk to the cousin/their parents directly if you have to. 

>That's a better option than paying thousands of dollars for the court to intervene. 

**booknerd381** 

>>Please upvote this. Court is not cheap and that better be the most impressive hoard of cards ever or you're never going to get anywhere near the value of the cards just to see a lawyer and have him tell you there's no way you'll get this to court. 

**OOP** 

>>>They are worth 5-5.5k in terms of today's value and more importantly, they have sentimental value to me and I'm pretty sure that's something. One other commentator suggested this is something the police would be able to handle so there is no need for any court so first I will try that and hopefully I get them back. 

>>>Thank you for mentioning how expensive that could be so I'll def keep it as a last resort. 

**OOP Also added** 

>>>The small claims court can only award me up to 1000$ (equivalent to my currency) which is not the monetary value of the cards. There is also sentimental value which is worth way more. 

>>>My sister is a lawyer and she said since the monetary value is huge, the police will get involved and treat it as a serious matter. 

>>>I have given her time to think about it but if she doesn't do anything I'll go and file an FIR against her and the cousin since I won't have any other option at that point. 

[Update](https://www.rareddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/rey2e3/update_should_i_sue_my_girlfriend_for_selling_my/)  **Dec 12, 2021 (2 months later)** 

Holy shit. Never thought this is how 2021 would end. A lot has happened since my first post. First, thank you for the support, some tips, and good luck. 

I'll start by clearing some assumptions. In my original post I said though ""Though I love her a lot, I believe I would rather have my cards"". This statement alone pissed some of you, so let me elaborate on that. My first ever 300 cards were from my father's collection. He died of hepatitis C. He was quite into gaming. My mum kept his cards for years and gave them to me when I was in my early teens and I got hooked. I grew the collection to 5000 cards. There was immense sentimental value attached to those cards. 

After my GF refused to talk to the cousin, he refusing to give me the cards when I asked, his parents being jerks to me, I took the legal route. Filed an FIR. Initially, I had trouble since the police didn't care about some cards but my sister, who is a lawyer (She is about to become a lawyer) told the police the estimated value and they got interested. We told the police 5 to 5.5k value of the cards. Things took time, but the police eventually confiscated the cards (4987) and got them appraised by a company. They came back with a value of approximately 6000$. I told the police the missing cards were also of substantial value since they were very old (Son of bitch sold the one my father left behind). Cousin told us who he sold to, and those people gave the cards back with no problems. Right now, the police have all the cards. The cousin who I knew had his eyes on my cards threw my GF under the bus. I know this because he wanted to buy those from me in the past, but I refused. He told the police he bought those in good faith. My GF also tried lying to the police, but since I had her on recording, she got into even more trouble. 

She got charged with grand larceny and also fined for lying to the police. 

I should get the cards by the end of this month or by early January. The police just said they need to finalize and file some reports and then I can have them. 

As for proof of all this, I had the cards photos front and back, along with some receipts. 

Some of you were also saying that I should take this to small claim court. This amount is too big for that, at least where I am. 

EDIT: I forgot to add my sister wants to sue all of them for emotional distress but I don't about that. Any advice on that? 

TLDR; She got arrested; the cousin got some ass whooping in front of me and I have almost got my cards back.

>>The cousin got nothing. He and his parents lied and my sister said not to say anything since we were getting what we wanted, which is the cards. I don't know what else to update. I should get my cards soon.

"Moonshots - I analyzed 3,000+ crypto's over the last 8 years to see if and how you should try to find moonshots : Here are the results.","All of us have at least once wished we had made a similar play to the one that [turned $17 into \~6M](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/21/05/21076574/he-invested-17-in-shiba-inu-now-he-has-almost-6m) or had gotten into the [right crypto at the right time.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/06/millennial-dogecoin-millionaire-on-being-paid-in-dogecoin.html) It’s not like we are alone in this thought process - there are more than 1.7 million people right now trying to find the [next crypto moonshot](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/). For those who are out of the loop, a moonshot is something that has a low probability of becoming extremely successful \[1\].

While it’s definitely nice to be the guy who made the correct play, what I wanted to understand is, how likely are you to pick the next big coin? After all, there are more than [2,400 dead coins](https://www.coinopsy.com/dead-coins/#other) that were part of someone’s moonshot not that long back. When a coin is dead, we would end up losing almost 100% of the capital that we invested in it thereby breaking the cardinal rule of investing.

>*Rule No. 1: Never lose money. Rule No. 2: Never forget rule No. 1 -* ***Warren Buffet***

While Warren Buffet might not be the best example for the crypto world, his advice holds true just as well in all investing spaces - Once you lose your capital, it’s game over. So in this deep-dive, let's see how the less popular cryptos have performed over the years, whether it makes sense to invest in them, and finally, would you have made better returns just by investing in the top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum?!

### Data & Analysis Methodology

All the data used in the analysis has been collected from coinmarketcap.com. Their data is available going as far back as 2014. I collected the price, market cap, and the symbol for all the coins listed in coinmarketcap on Jan 1st of every year from 2014 to 2022. There were only 67 listed coins in 2014. The list has grown to more than 3,000+ as of Jan 2022. All the data and my analysis are shared as a Rows sheet at the end.

The analysis is fairly simple and I have intentionally made the strategy straightforward so that it’s easy to replicate. We will be comparing the performance of the Top 10 Cryptocurrencies with the next 90 based on the total market cap of the coin.

[The end of 2017 was definitely some wild time to be in the Crypto space.](https://preview.redd.it/ie9owd9mylv81.png?width=895&format=png&auto=webp&s=4830cb8e014e559cb2754b8f514a90a7f1787ac1)

I have limited the analysis to the top 100 coins because of two reasons

1. Even now, close to 95% of the combined market cap of the crypto market is contributed by just the top 100 coins. Adding to this, it becomes more and more difficult/riskier \[2\] to invest in coins having low market cap due to platform and liquidity issues.
2. There are hundreds of new coins that are being launched every day. It’s almost impossible to keep track of all the coins and realistically do proper due diligence before investing. So for practical feasibility, I am limiting it to the top 100.

### Results

Before we jump straight into the return calculation, it’s interesting to see how the crypto market has changed over the years.

https://preview.redd.it/m0fng8moylv81.png?width=649&format=png&auto=webp&s=98fb3edb350696ab03e9136c7b2eaf3ab9f46336

In the first few years where crypto was becoming mainstream (2014 to 2017), the top 10 currencies dominated the overall market cap contributing close to 99% \[3\]. Also, during crashes, we can observe a massive shift in capital allocation from Altcoin to Bitcoin → 2017 was one of the best bull runs (barring 2021) where we can see that Bitcoin only contributed to \~39% of the market cap. But once the bear market set in (2018-19), the allocation to bitcoin proportionally increased until the 2021 bull run.

#### Creating a Crypto Index

To answer our initial question → Whether it’s better to invest in the top 10 most popular cryptos or the other 90 relatively lesser-known ones, we will be creating an equal-weighted index \[4\].

We have two people Alan and Charlie who want to get into the crypto market in 2014, but both are following a slightly different approach.

Alan will invest only in the top 10 most popular currencies. Every new year, he will go and check the top 10 cryptos by Market Cap and then equally invest between the top 10 cryptocurrencies. Charlie, on the other hand, will do the exact same thing with the only difference being that instead of the top 10, he will invest in the 90 next biggest cryptocurrencies.

They continue to do this over the next 8 years and now it’s 2022 and it’s time to see who has performed better.

[Returns shown here are till Jan 1st, 2022](https://preview.redd.it/5u10wctsylv81.png?width=628&format=png&auto=webp&s=aacb02399d50dbd1d1874aba631a97dc354dbaab)

Would you look at that! Alan who has invested in only the top-10 cryptos did vastly better than Charlie who went for the riskier play of investing in the not so well known currencies. The top 10 cryptos on average performed 5x better than the next 90 and 2x better than just investing in Bitcoin. What’s even more interesting is that Charlie would have done 2x better just putting his money in Bitcoin - Ouch!

#### Survival

If you are wondering why Charlie is getting the lowest return in spite of taking the most risk\[5\], it’s because you are forgetting Rule 1 of investing - To not lose your initial investment.

https://preview.redd.it/mmntwr9vylv81.png?width=714&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c69754b5cbf65bc865d87a11ea5116baf9f5a70

The probability of survival of a coin is extremely skewed towards the top 10 currencies. As you can see, over 80% of the top 10 coins from 2014 are still in existence today compared to only 26% of the rest. This trend keeps repeating over the years and your capital would have been decimated. Once it goes to zero, there is no way for it to come back up as any gain on $0 is still 0!

#### Moonshots

Finally, we come to what we are all here for! What are our chances of actually hitting a moonshot following this strategy?

[I have defined a 100x return as a Moonshot](https://preview.redd.it/j8oiifewylv81.png?width=404&format=png&auto=webp&s=fec161da3968b773bb1f96eca3da9c114da48cd9)

Well, your chances of hitting a moonshot are also much higher following the top-10 strategy. Overall, you had a 1 in 10 chance of getting a 10,000% return compared to the 1 in 30 chance of the riskier next-90 strategy.

The above chart also shows another interesting stat → Out of the 500+ cryptos that we analyzed, less than 4% of them ended up becoming a moonshot. Think about that for a min - Of all the cryptos you are likely to hear about (*as there is very less coverage if it’s not in the top 100*), only 3-4% of them end up giving you those insane returns. You have similar chances betting on a single number on the Roulette wheel.

https://preview.redd.it/23hva9qyylv81.png?width=391&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bf4c72e5515d1c77faa01aa82b29eaf590c6289

As you can see, of all our moonshots, Ethereum investment in 2016 ended up returning the most at a whopping 397,548%!

### Limitations

It’s important to understand the limitations of the current analysis before trying to replicate it.

1. **Data** \- As I discussed earlier, all the data is from coinmarketcap and I have assumed a coin is dead if it’s not listed in the following year’s data. This analysis is only as strong as the quality of input data \[6\]. I have done extensive QCs but feel free to play around with the raw data to see if I missed something.
2. **Base Effect** \- The market is considerably different now than it was in 2015-17. There is more awareness as well as penetration. So the future growth might not be as explosive as the one that we observed in the past decade, so you should be realistic about your return potential
3. **Intra Year Returns** \- The current analysis only considers returns based on Jan 1st of every year starting from 2014. If we pick another date within the year, we might get slightly different results as there might have been ATHs and ATLs within the year which we are not capturing.

### Conclusion

>*It's not whether you're right or wrong that's important, but how much money you make when you're right and how much you lose when you're wrong — George Soros*

I started the analysis thinking that investing in the not-so-popular currencies is bound to give better returns as it’s more likely they are undervalued due to lower publicity and hype associated with them.

But, as we saw from the data, in the case of crypto it’s much more profitable just to invest in the top currencies. It’s like the case where being in the game is much more important than trying to hit it big and striking out!

"GME Melt-up this Summer/Fall, learn to trade like RK","I've gone from 50k to 300k the last year with one big trade on tech stocks (magnificent 7), and have recently all-in'd into GME 1-2 weeks before RK made his reappearance, and have since become (briefly) a millionaire for the first time in my life. I've written this post to educate apes on the basics I used to do these trades. Nothing fancy, just the tried and true fundamentals. My inspiration was to try and learn to invest + trade like RK.

Let's go over the basics of identifying trends, learn about options, and prepare to trade on GME like RK. The goal is to buy as much shares as possible by maximizing the value of your cash with intelligently taken risks. Of course, the level of risk depends on your personality and risk aversion, so take that into consideration and enumerate a variety of options depending on your personal comfort level.

I've watched GME since the last melt-up scenario and have invested in the tech stock rally during GME's 3 year downtrend in order to generate a lot of money to make a big play on GME upon reversal. Our thesis is that eventually shorts will lose control causing a squeeze, so, at some point there must be a major trend reversal. I ended up buying in about 1-2 weeks before RK made his YOLO update in May after noticing an obvious trend reversal.

We will cover:

* Moving averages, simple moving average (SMA)
* Support and resistance levels
* Trends and Crossovers
* Relative strength index (RSI)
* Confluence
* Options, strike, premium, expiry, theta, IV, delta
* 🐱

If you want some resources to research these topics on your own, I highly suggest checking out Adam Khoo's free youtube videos. He covers all of these topics for free.

It's important to note these techniques are mostly useful for beginners. Once you become more experienced, often it's enough to simply glance at the chart. But, these techniques are very useful for confirmation before placing trades, or for learning purposes.

# Moving Averages

Moving averages show the average price over a span of days, typically 10 days, 20 days, 50 days, or 100 days. This is a lagging indicator, meaning it doesn't predict anything in the future with any probability - it simply shows you the average of the past.

Let's look at one of RK's charts showing moving averages of GME over the last few months.

[https:\/\/stockcharts.com\/public\/1778236](https://preview.redd.it/fzl1jpbtnz6d1.png?width=1083&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2611d0b701d5f44a5fe384fa928cc9e2e2b4de9)

RK has chosen to look at the 20 (blue), 50 (red), and 100 (green) day moving averages. These lines can show indications of trends and trend reversals.

# Support and Resistance Levels

The primary utility of moving averages are to illuminate [support/resistance levels](https://www.investopedia.com/trading/support-and-resistance-basics/), and to give signals about bullish/bearish crossovers. Briefly: support and resistance levels are psychological levels of price, and the price often bounces off of them.

Let's take a look at an example of support and resistance levels.

[https:\/\/www.fidelity.com\/learning-center\/trading-investing\/technical-analysis\/support-and-resistance](https://preview.redd.it/02rdwidvnz6d1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=813489ec447ad8663f0ed5ce2069b9965ac3bab2)

As the price rises and bounces downward multiple times at the same price, we can call this a resistance level. The inverse is a support level, where the price falls and bounces upward multiple times at the same level. Support and resistances are rather reliable and useful ways to look at stocks.

You don't need a fancy chart or to actually draw lines of charts to identify lines of support and resistance, and the lines don't need to be horizontal either (though they often are horizontal), and can also be slanted.

When deciding to place a trade it's common practice to always wait for price action to arrive at a previously established level of support. This adds some probability your trade will go as speculated. It's important to learn a variety of strategies to add rigor to your trade speculations, to build a confluence of indicators or observations.

# Moving Averages as Support/Resistance

Moving averages are often used as support or resistance lines. Let's take a look at another one of RK's charts, and pay attention to the blue 8-day moving average.

[https:\/\/stockcharts.com\/public\/1778236](https://preview.redd.it/wwqddp8xnz6d1.png?width=1094&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb3040f09a3cb347c38c9d1f1e9866cf1eb5d4ed)

We can generally see that during an uptrend in price the stock bounces off of the 8 MA during dips, and continues to rise thereafter. During downtrends we can see the stock typically bounces off of the 8 MA during rises, and continues to dip thereafter.

Here's an example during an uptrend during the late 2020 melt-up:

https://preview.redd.it/za0x0xwynz6d1.png?width=217&format=png&auto=webp&s=1eebbdce9ba297214f79d8539192a25dc30490f1

And here's an example during the 2022 downtrend:

https://preview.redd.it/pgz9sgwznz6d1.png?width=215&format=png&auto=webp&s=4886f6a4ed4ba7202b82cbdade370030f7254105

# Uptrends and Downtrends

Briefly, let's define an uptrend and a downtrend. For beginners it can be a little difficult to spot exactly where an uptrend begins or ends.

Uptrend: higher highs and higher lows.

Downtrend: lower highs and lower lows.

The stock market can never simply go up or down in a straight line, it always oscillates back and forth, like breathing. Breathe in, breathe out. Therefor we must look at the peaks and valleys to see if the highest highs are growing, or shrinking.

[https:\/\/phemex.com\/academy\/what-are-highs-and-lows-in-trading](https://preview.redd.it/rgf7pd71oz6d1.png?width=474&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb028aa871b2c6a061463f3a413eca95420de355)

# Trends and Crossovers

Trends do not persist indefinitely and frequently change. It's important to identify trends and when they are reversing. Generally speaking when a more short-dated MA crosses below a longer MA it signals a shift to a downtrend. Similarly, when a more short-dated MA crosses back above a longer MA it signals a shift to an uptrend. We can see this more clearly on a more stable security like SPY, as opposed to GME (since GME is very volatile).

https://preview.redd.it/v7qnj8c4oz6d1.png?width=1300&format=png&auto=webp&s=58c7cbaf7b5496d36a94f02e2591be620b2a23ea

The red line is the 200 MA, while the blue line is the 50 MA. Whenever we see the 50 MA cross below the 200 MA we have an obvious downtrend. Similarly, whenever the 50 MA crosses back above the 200 MA we see an obvious up-trend.

When looking at MA crossovers it's also very important to look at the slope of the lines. If the lines cross, but they are not all sloping downwards, this is a less effective indicator of a downturn. However, if they cross downward and are also sloping downward, this is confirmation of the trend. Similarly, if the lines cross back upwards and are sloping upwards, this is confirmation of an uptrend.

I myself made a massive options trade on the tech stock rally in May 2023 by simply using this technique on the SPY. I noticed the crossover was not quite bullish as the 200 MA was still sloping downwards. However, in mid-May or so the 200 MA started sloping upwards, signaling a good opportunity to buy-in and confirming the start of a new market-wide bull run. By using options this resulted in a 300% gain in my portfolio over the next year.

[The 200 MA and 50 MA began both sloping upward after a crossover, confirming the 2024 bull market](https://preview.redd.it/t4hrj0c5oz6d1.png?width=293&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2e90284cd97493116e7125d92b954d4b23d5da2)

Since MA's are lagging indicators you might miss out on a lot of opportunity if you only look at long-dated averages like the 50 or 200. This is why RK also looks at the 10 or 8-day MA. However, another indicator is very powerful to learn about in conjunction with MA's, that adds in some forward-looking predictive power.

# Relative Strength Index (RSI)

The RSI tells us, with some predictive power, how strong the rises are relative to how strong the falls are. It's best to pair this indicator with moving averages.

https://preview.redd.it/16gqpmn7oz6d1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=32d79f498aa2e26d48609e992cea8acf1acd2320

The RSI has an overbought region and an oversold region, as well as a mid-line. Generally, if the RSI is above the 50% point it means the strength of the stock is bullish. Another way of phrasing this: the rises are consistently larger than the falls. However, sometimes a stock will rise a little too quickly, signaling to traders a good time to sell, and the RSI indicates this quite clearly. Similarly, if the stock falls too quickly it will generally snap back to the trend, which is signaled by the oversold region.

We can apply our knowledge of moving averages and supports/resistance levels to enhance our trading success probability. Again, you probably don't need to actually draw lines on your charts, but as a beginner it can certainly help to do so! We could using moving averages, but, we could also use resistance lines like so:

https://preview.redd.it/62bxz909oz6d1.png?width=1050&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9dd9c4afd6e741a507896f9640b271726268778

It becomes very clear on the RSI chart the 50% point acts as extremely strong resistance during an uptrend. We can use this indicator to place bullish trades. Conversely, we can use the 70% line as an indicator of when to sell.

https://preview.redd.it/uqw86zvaoz6d1.png?width=1050&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c851edabaeb49a24cc06bae3d9ee39d06641527

This graph is just an example of the concept. Next we will apply this to GME.

# Confluence

When placing trades you should always look for a confluence of indicators that matches up with a variety of different ways to analyze a stock. When trading on GME you should look for:

* levels of support
* moving averages to identify the trend and reversals
* RSI to indicate trend, or reversals

You should be mixing these different strategies together. So how did RK identify such a good time to place his trades? It's quite likely he took advantage of/caused the May trend reversal. His chart shows things quite clearly:

[RSI bounces on the 30&#37; line showing excellent times for trades](https://preview.redd.it/v0f863cstz6d1.png?width=1112&format=png&auto=webp&s=ccddbb126eb03fcb61704b464fb3f61fe0c41f8b)

We can see RK clearly mark the $10 spot as a critical low in GME for the last 3 years. This was as low as the shorts could possibly get the price. Let us zoom in to the last few months.

[Bullish crossover of all the MA's, and upwards slopes for all MA's](https://preview.redd.it/9jflsif2uz6d1.png?width=1106&format=png&auto=webp&s=d00bec8d1b526e3c6e3f7100a1ebc2414a0058dc)

We can clearly see the price finally reach a low at 10, but, it also had repeatedly bounced off the 30% line on the 5-year RSI chart (weekly candles). This presents a great confluence of RSI resistance, as well as price action resistance. This signals a great time to make a huge bullish play to attempt to time/trigger a bullish reversal. If we also apply our knowledge of GME swap cycles and FTD cycles, this timeframe is likely where RK made many millions on an option trade. This situation is a majestic confluence, primed for a great trade.

The year-to-date (YTD) chart (the above image) shows the RSI on the daily candles. We can see that RSI spiked early May to the oversold region, which signals a potential trend reversal.

[Sustained RSI resistance above 50&#37; \(bullish zone\)](https://preview.redd.it/n7bf9uqooz6d1.png?width=380&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d2fe6522940233f0d0d73435b502d63c022a812)

[Sustained high-volume, indicating a continuation of the trend reversal](https://preview.redd.it/z2ulmf9qoz6d1.png?width=307&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b844d75e258de8577029809bc2b575b1dc31e35)

Since the price stabilized on the RSI chart above the 50% region, this indicates bullish presence and signals an uptrend. Additionally all moving averages crossed over and are sloping upwards. Finally, we can note that volume at this time skyrockets and sustains. All of these provided me with clear indications of an uptrend reversal, signaling myself to go all-in in May, 1-2 weeks before RK's public return.

# Options

Options are a broad topic, but I'll cover the essentials here. For a more in-depth education I recommend checking out Adam Khoo's free videos on youtube. This section will be brief - use it as a platform to launch into your own self-studies for options. I would even recommend considering buying an online course on options and trading if you can afford it.

We will cover:

* Expiry
* Strike
* Premium
* Theta
* IV
* Delta

An option represents a pack of 100 stocks. For a fee you can buy an option, which gives you control over 100 stocks. The price of options is cheaper than outright buying stocks. This provides a form of leverage, and multiplies the returns/losses as the stock price goes up/down.

Options have an expiration date. Eventually, upon expiry, the option ceases to exist. This means you can purchase an option to get leverage, but only for a short time. This makes options riskier than holding plain stocks.

As an option gets closer to expiry it loses value. Eventually the premium (a fee paid for purchasing the option) goes to zero. How sensitive an option is to this decay is called ""theta"". You can view the theta of an option quite easily in any broker/app.

When you purchase an option you have the opportunity to buy the underlying 100 shares at the *strike price*. Each option has a strike price. Who is obligated to sell you these shares? Whoever wrote the contract (sold it originally) is obligated to sell 100 shares at the strike price. This gets into terms such as in-the-money and out-of-the-money. To learn more on these I highly recommend youtube or ChatGPT.

IV stands for implied volatility. It's simply a predictor of how volatile the stock is, as in how likely it is to make large price-swings. Higher IV means the option itself is expensive. Lower IV means the option is cheap.

The delta measures the sensitivity of an option's price to changes in the price of the underlying stock. It maps stock price changes to option price changes. Delta hedging is when the option writer (the original seller of the option, often a market maker) buys stock after selling an option in order to anticipate the likelihood of an upward swing in price.

# Trading on GME

To wrap things up, quite simply, all the indicators we've covered so far clearly show GME is in an uptrend reversal. This is confirmed by support/resistance levels, moving average crossovers, RSI on the daily/weekly candles, as well as a clearly observable and sustained uptick in volume.

My recommendation would be to try and ignore all the short-term noise. It doesn't matter if GME dilutes, or if there's a merger, or some negative news articles, a billion reddit bots logging in and FUD'ing, if this guy or that guy puts a banana in his butt, if the moon turns blood red, or if christ returns. We can clearly see over the course of weeks/months GME is very likely to experience a major melt-up scenario.

https://preview.redd.it/5nq7lxsguz6d1.png?width=214&format=png&auto=webp&s=b33f29426ce481b2d80432acde449af7e4af82e4

We can see the melt-up took about 6-months to complete back in 2020. However, if we look at current day trends we can see indicators the process is faster now:

* Volume picked up quicker
* RSI spiked higher, faster

How exactly can a melt-up occur? Honestly, it doesn't really matter, as there are many ways. The basic concept is that if bulls are in control of the stock for long enough then *something will break*. The longer GME uptrends the more likely for *something to break*. This could be a failure of market maker manipulation algorithms, a gamma squeeze, or a plain-old short squeeze where some shorts capitulate/get liquidated. Any number of things can happen behind the scenes, and we likely won't know which of them occur for many years after the fact, if not ever.

My recommendation would be to expect, this summer/fall, a large lurch upwards in GME's price. Far dated options such as LEAP's would be an excellent thing to pick up, or perhaps some CALL options for August/Oct. If you're more confident and risk tolerant you can try using the trading techniques discussed here for more short term trades on spikes/dips as the melt-up scenario unfolds.

If you're highly risk-averse, simply holding as much stock as you can afford and making your purchase sometime before a melt-up occurs would be wise. I'm personally targeting anytime this Summer/Fall, as opposed to Winter/Spring like in 2020-2021, mainly because of these factors:

* Higher volume
* RSI spike from low-to-high
* Large # of shares DRS'd
* GME is in a way better fiscal position
* Swaps are likely expired/expiring
* Violent bounce off the $10 resistance
* Bounced off of $60 resistance level
* Spikes in bot/shill activity
* RK YOLO again
* RK share count homage to the 2020 trend reversal triggered by RC's initial purchase

Do you really want to bet against RK, the best trader of our age?

Top 5 Tips Every Noobie Trader MUST Know.,"Been awhile since I made a post educating you retards, throwing pearls before swine. I've been disheartened by some of the comments I've read recently and just wanted to provide some tips for the genuine noobies/retards among us. If you already know this shit, congrats, move along sir.

Take a look at my previous, more advanced guide to some theta gang theory for those looking for something a bit more in depth: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iz68r4/how\_to\_consistently\_outperform\_the\_sp500\_using/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iz68r4/how_to_consistently_outperform_the_sp500_using/)

Without further ado... TOP 5 TIPS Every Noobie Trader MUST Know.

# 1) You MUST understand Implied Volatility.

I made this the first point because it is the gigantic mistake I see noobies here making again and again. I'm talking to you, people who bought calls on PLTR at $30.  **If you learn anything from this post, you MUST learn this.**

You see a stock make a massive move either up or down. Your immediate response is ""this is a great opportunity to buy calls/puts on a volatile stock!"" Right? WRONG!

In fact, when a stock has just made a massive move in either direction, that is perhaps the WORST time to purchase options in EITHER direction. Options are not stupid. Options are designed to price in the fact that a stock is moving wildly. This is called ""implied volatility."" They become more expensive as a stock makes more dramatic moves, to price in the volatility you and everyone else is expecting.

It's quite possible and even likely that you buy an option on a high IV stock, and the stock moves in your direction, and yet you LOSE money, because it didn't move as dramatically as was expected by the implied volatility. **This is called ""IV crush.""** It only takes one or two experiences with IV crush for most traders to learn this lesson for life. If you understand this concept before you lose a ton of money, all the better.

**So, what should you do if a stock is highly volatile and options are expensive due to IV?**

There are two choices: Trade actual shares, or SELL the options rather than buy them.

If you are bullish on a high IV stock, you can take a bullish position by SELLING a cash-secured put rather than buying the call. If you are bearish on a high IV stock, you can take a bearish position by SELLING a call rather than buying a put (although this entails greater risk and will typically require higher options trading level by your broker).

# 2) You MUST have patience.

It's a tale as old as time. A noobie investor does some research, reads some DD, and is convinced a stock is going to rise over the next couple years. So he buys in. A bad day or two hits and the stock tanks. He panics, and sells. The next couple days the stock rises and appears to stabilize. So he buys back in again, because he still believes in his thesis. The stock drops again, and he panic sells again.

In reality the stock is just trading sideways, but this idiot keeps buying on green days and selling on red days. This is perhaps the most idiotic, suicidal strategy anyone could ever employ. Buying on green and selling on red is a surefire strategy to lose money consistently over time.

This is why you MUST remove your emotions from your trades, because your emotions will usually tell you to buy on green and sell on red, literally buy high and sell low. As the boomer Warren Buffett once stated: **""The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.""**

Here is a better approach. Set up your entire trade BEFORE you make the trade. Have a set price you will sell at if things go south. Have a target price you will sell at if things go well. Once the dust settles you can learn from any mistakes. Were you too aggressive, or too conservative in your targets? What emotions directed you to make those mistakes? Too much greed, too much risk aversion, too LITTLE risk aversion? Make every trade a learning opportunity.

# 3) You MUST understand ""Reversion to the Mean.""

In general, stocks will tend to revert to their trendlines.

This thesis is fairly simple. If a stock moons 10% in a day, the most likely event is a drop the next day. If a stock tanks 10% in a day, the most likely event is a rise the next day. This is because humans are emotional creatures. First, they overreact to big news. Next, one of two things happen: When the stock is way up, people see it as a profit taking opportunity, so they sell. When the stock is way down, people see it as a buying opportunity, so they buy.

I don't have any hard data to back up this thesis, but I'm sure there's a bunch of nerds out there with hard data that proves exactly this, as well as trading algorithms specifically designed for a ""reversion to the mean"" strategy that are consistently profitable.

Obviously there will be exceptions, as well as times when a big move signals a shift in the trendline. All I am saying is in the MAJORITY of cases, reversion to the mean will occur. Don't go chasing stocks that have made massive short-term swings in a single direction unless you have strong reasons (not just hopes) to believe the trend has changed.

# 4) You MUST not YOLO your account more than once (or twice).

This is going to be controversial for some of you. But it's just straight math. If you keep betting your entire account, or close to it, on single trades, **it's only a matter of time before you go broke. That is a mathematical guarantee.**

Let's say you are one of the most skilled, intelligent, informed investors on the planet (doubtful). So skilled your plays are 90% correct. If you bet your entire portfolio on each trade, you are still expected to go completely broke after around 10 trades.

Let's say you aren't a brilliant stonk gambler. Let's say you are just average and your trades are a coin flip (which is generous for a lot of you retards). **If you bet your entire bankroll on each bet, on average you will go completely broke in just 2 trades.**

Again, there is a lot of complicated math we can go through to predict account explosion times and optimal bet sizing and so on, but that isn't necessary here. Professional gamblers such as poker players have refined bankroll management theory, which usually means at the least they aren't putting more than 10% of their cash on the table in one sitting, usually closer to 5%. (Take a look at the ""Kelley criterion"" for an interesting read: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly\_criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion))

I know a lot of you are broke with no life prospects and hoping to get rich quick. I don't fault you for that, I get it. The problem arises when you see the people who got insanely lucky with guessing 10 coin flips in a row who turned $1000 into $1,000,000, and hope to do the same... **but for every one retard with a record like that you've got hundreds more who lose it all and have nothing to show for it.**

I won't fault anyone for making a gigantic, life-changing bet a single time. That is your choice to make, and it just might pay off. But if you think you are going to do that again and again and survive, you are delusional.

# 5) You MUST be Skeptical... of EVERYTHING.

Fools and their money are soon parted. Don't be a fool.

Your first instincts when hearing ANYTHING should be skepticism. Your friend has a hot stock tip? Start with skepticism. Some online DD on a meme or penny stock online sounds convincing? Start with skepticism. A highly respected financial or government agency gives future guidance on whatever... again, start with skepticism.

There are a million people out there trying to take advantage of you, to pump and dump you, to scam you, to trick you into spending more money on whatever.

There are times when being a conformist pays off, like when markets rally for months straight. There are times when being a contrarian pays off, like when markets tank and sectors collapse. Don't be a consistent conformist nor a consistent contrarian. Be skeptical of every thesis and every hypothesis you hear, or even the ones you invent yourself.

When you take this approach honestly and still become convinced of a thesis, you have a higher probability than most of being correct.

**Seek out opinions that contradict your biases, not opinions that confirm your biases.** This is incredibly difficult and goes against human nature, but if you can achieve this ideal, you will out-trade 90% of the public.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/s/NuWwDMJbpn): **December 29, 2023**

Sorry, this is gonna be a long one.

I (27F) have been with my boyfriend (28M, Jay) for 5 years.

We’ve both been very close with each other’s families, and we’ve even talked about marriage. However, one touchy subject is children. Whenever we discuss it, he gets kinda stand-offish. He doesn’t really dismiss the idea though, it’s just that he doesn’t seem invested. I’ve always wanted kids, and he just always says he’s fine with whatever makes me happy. Ever since, I’ve been content with this situation.

However, things escalated during this holiday season.

Our setup has always been that Jay spends Christmas Eve and dinner with my family, then I spend Christmas Day with his family. This was the first Christmas I’ll spend with my first and only niece (2F, Ana, she spent her first Christmas in the hospital due to her health condition, but she’s okay now), so I made sure to spend a lot of time with her. We played a lot, we opened gifts together, and I even reenacted Ana’s favorite storybook using her favorite doll. We even had matching outfits!

My sister (30F, Amy) thanked me for giving her and her husband some relief from childcare the entire day. However, Amy also said she noticed that Jay, who was just either sitting on the couch watching me or helping my mom with the dishes, was kinda distant with Ana. I told her I’ve also noticed that before, and I just chalked it up to maybe Jay was hesitant and awkward to play with Ana because he feels he’s “just my boyfriend.” Then Amy said she won’t mind, since she and her husband already treat Jay as part of our family.

I then went back to Jay and encouraged him to play with Ana and help us set up her new dollhouse, but he said he’s not feeling too well. He ended up drinking a few more beers and stayed on the porch by himself, scrolling on his phone. I didn’t press harder and thought he might really just be feeling under the weather. I just want to add for context that Jay isn’t an alcoholic. He’s a sweet, wonderful, funny man who’s sometimes broody and deep in thought, but he’s never abusive, manipulative, or moody, and he only drinks on special occasions.

The next day, on Christmas Day, we had lunch with Jay’s family. Afterward, I volunteered for cleanup to help Jay’s mom (62F, Mary) and brother (31M, John). Jay’s family was the best any significant other could ever ask for. They’re very sweet and supportive of us, but they’re never prying. They always check up on us, but they never overstep. So, as we were cleaning up, Mary asked me how my sister’s baby was (they helped with the bills when Ana was hospitalized last year). I told them that Ana’s in great condition now, and that she already spent the Christmas at home. They were very delighted upon hearing this.

Then, I shared with them the thing I noticed about Jay. Initially, I thought maybe Mary could just give me advice on how to approach the issue with Jay since he’s clearly not the playing-with-kids kind of guy, but then John casually said something like “Oh, because of Rosie,” then Mary quickly shushed him. Rosie was the daughter of Jay and John’s eldest sister, Beth (35F). I never knew the actual details because everyone was very secretive about it, but all I knew was that Rosie passed away when she was just 3 years old and Beth and her husband moved away afterward. I never met them in person.

So, later that night, when Mary, John, and the other family members got a bit more drunk and Jay was already sleeping in the bedroom, they told me the story (I didn’t force them or anything). Apparently, Jay, being the youngest of the siblings, was really close with Rosie back then. Jay was just around 14 years old when Rosie was born, so he became the super fun uncle (like I am now with Ana). He was actually Rosie’s best friend. Then, on summer of 2012, Jay was playing with Rosie outside (he was blowing bubbles and she was chasing and popping them) when a speeding car, driven by a woman who was distracted on her phone, skidded into the yard toward Rosie’s direction. Jay reacted quickly and was able to reach and grab Rosie so the car actually hit him, but the impact of the crash caused Rosie’s head to whiplash as Jay hugged her. Jay was in a coma for 3 days and had multiple severe injuries and internal bleeding, but Rosie didn’t make it.

Everything was caught by the neighbor’s CCTV so everyone knew that Jay was a hero for trying to protect Rosie (it was even covered by the local news), but Beth, who was understandably in grief, resented Jay for not being able to save her daughter. Beth and her husband then decided to move to another country to cope with their grief and start a new life, and they’ve had minimal contact with the family ever since. Jay, meanwhile, took the loss really hard. He blamed himself for not being able to save Rosie and not being able to attend her funeral since he was still at the hospital at that time. Mary said that Jay was never the same after that. He never went near kids, and he became a lot colder, quieter, more reserved, and antisocial. He also had anger issues, but it thankfully went away (I haven't had any issues with this). We also live in an area where people don’t believe in therapy, so Jay never received professional help.

After learning all of this, I bawled my eyes out because I never knew Jay was carrying such a heavy burden. The whole incident became a taboo family secret that no one mentions in fear of Jay breaking down or doing something he might regret (although to be fair, he’s never had violent or self-harm tendencies ever since, so this was just a precaution). They also never told me before because they assumed Jay would be the one to tell me, but I told them that he never did, and that I never really asked him. I then thanked everyone for letting me in on this, and I told them that I’d talk to Jay about it when the time is right. They understood, and they said I could just ring them up if I need help or support in any way. For now, I just want Jay to enjoy the holidays and his remaining vacation days from work.

Now, I don’t really know how to start with him. I know seeking professional help to process all the trauma and grief, even if it’s been over a decade ago, would be the top priority, but I don’t know how to bring it up to him. I don’t even know when is the right time to bring it up. I just want him to know that I love him no matter what, and that I’ll support him in every step toward his healing, especially if we’re to form a family of our own.

**Relevant Comments**

**lovinglifeatmyage:** Jay is amazing, what a shame his sister blamed him, but I guess that’s what grief does to you.

I hope he gets the therapy he needs

> **OOP:** From what I gathered from Jay's family, Beth never really voiced out that she blamed Jay for Rosie's passing. However, she became cold toward him to the point of almost ignoring him during family gatherings before they moved. Of course, everyone knew what it was all about.

**CynicallyCyn:** Holy crap I think we were all thinking that he had the worst intentions in the beginning. But that couldn’t be more wrong. This man was a hero and unfortunately his family has turned it into a dirty secret. I feel for you both so much. I don’t really have any advice. I just want you to know that you are both incredible people and I hope your love finds a way and you’re able to raise a beautiful family together, if you choose.

> **OOP:** It's really sad how the family handled it, but I can't really blame them because I grew up in the same area. We live in a provincial, non-progressive city, and their family even lives in a more rural community where everyone knows everyone. If there's any ""scandal"" that potentially tarnishes the family name, it's swept under the rug.
> 
> I guess the ""heroic"" part of the story is something the family could have been proud of, but the trauma, anger issues, lashing out, and antisocial behavior that Jay developed, as well as how Beth left the community afterward outweighed everything, so the entire thing just became the family's dirty secret.

**FruitcakeAndCrumb:** She died as he was hugging her, I. Can't imagine the grief he went through.

> **OOP:** That's also something bothering me a lot. Of course, I'm just assuming here, but knowing how much of an overthinker Jay is who hyperfixates on what ifs, I know he has replayed that moment in his head a million times, overanalyzing every little detail.
> 
> One of the worst things he could possibly be thinking is that maybe he was the one who killed Rosie, because it was the whiplash and not the actual crash that impacted her the most. It's bad enough that he lost his niece and best friend, but for her to die in his arms and thinking that it was him who might've accidentally killed her instead of saving her is absolutely horrible.
> 
> That's the ""what if"" I fear he's thinking the most. And just to be clear, no one actually blames him.

**NoshameNoLies:** Why are they so hard pressed on forcing him to interact with a child more than he wants to? Instead of letting him get comfortable in his own time, you're all forcing him to do it right now. I'm very uncomfortable with children but given time I'll come around, I just need to get over the anxiety and panic about hurting them by accident. If somebody and their family were this insistent I'd just be more uncomfortable.

> **OOP:** I don't think anyone is really forcing him though. In the 2 years we've welcomed Ana into this world, no one has forced Jay to interact with her just for the sake of it. I've been interacting with Ana every time our family gets together, and Jay has been distant but fine overall, and we just let him be because it was never an issue. We all just accepted that he wasn't comfortable around kids. Also, when I was encouraging him to interact more during Christmas Eve, it was more along the lines of ""Hey, you know you're welcome to help us with this dollhouse, you know? I know you're judging my lack of craftsmanship here lol""
> 
> Amy's intention of bringing this to my attention is just to make Jay feel more welcome in our family. Again, it was me who assumed that maybe Jay was just awkward with Ana because he might've felt like an outsider and he didn't want to overstep. My entire conversation with Amy was rooted more in including Jay in our family and making him feel comfortable enough.
> 
> However, given everything I've learned, I'll make sure that everyone is more sensitive with this subject around him.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/s/rFm1I2iQzT): **April 19, 2024 (almost 4 months later)**

Hi, it’s been a while since my first post. I have some major updates for anyone interested. You may check my profile for my previous post.

Also, I took some time to organize my thoughts first to make sure I don't miss anything pertinent. It's kinda long as a lot have happened since, so I've divided this into sections to make it easier to follow.

QUICK RECAP

My boyfriend (Jay) and I have been together for 5 years. Throughout our relationship, I noticed that he's always distant with kids, including my niece, Ana. During Christmas, Jay's family revealed that it was because of an incident over a decade ago. Turns out, Jay was really close with his toddler niece, Rosie. One day, when they were playing outside, they were hit by a distracted driver. Jay tried to save Rosie. He sustained severe injuries, but Rosie still didn't make it. Beth (Rosie's mom and Jay's sister) acted cold toward Jay after this, then she and her husband moved to another country after a few months. From then on, Jay's personality changed, becoming cold and antisocial, and he never received professional help. All of this has become Jay's family's ""dirty"" secret. 

PART 1: THE CONFESSION

Since learning about Rosie and posting here on Reddit, I’ve been so conflicted about what to do. A lot of you had opposing opinions, and all of them had merit, but knowing Jay and how he’d most likely react, I chose to keep it a secret until I find the perfect time.

What I didn’t anticipate was that the perfect time would come in the form of a pregnancy scare. Back in January, I had a false positive. Everything happened so quickly within a day. I had a rollercoaster of emotions, but bottom line was that I’m not pregnant after all. When Jay got back home that night, I knew I had to tell him everything. I told him I had a pregnancy scare, but he has nothing to worry about since it ended up being negative. At that moment, I saw all the blood drain from his face, and he became so pale that I was worried he was going to faint. I was holding his hand, and he became so sweaty and cold and shaky. He rushed to our refrigerator to get some water, and it was obvious he was spiraling really hard. That was when I told him I knew about Rosie. 

I came clean because I knew that was what he was panicking about. I assured him that I’m by his side, and he could react however he wanted to. I repeatedly apologized for disrespecting his trust and lying to him for weeks. I also asked him to please not be mad at his family because they meant well when they told me. Throughout all of it, I couldn’t really read Jay’s expressions. I wasn’t sure if he was about to scream out of anger or burst into tears. I told him that we don’t have to talk about it any further if he doesn’t want to, but I’d be willing to listen and support him whenever he’s ready.

His only response that time was him asking me if I wanted to break up with him, which confused me. I told him of course not, then we hugged, then he said he needs some time to process everything before we discuss it, which I respected. For the rest of the week, we tried to interact like nothing happened, but everything was awkward since there’s this huge thing hanging between us.

PART 2: THE TALK

The following weekend (which was 8 days after), we finally sat down and talked about everything. He started by apologizing for not telling me sooner, but he revealed that his last girlfriend dumped him after he told her about Rosie. He said he was so relieved after I reassured him that I wouldn’t do that. He then told me that it was something that’s been weighing him ever since, and he’s confirmed that he never sought or received professional help. However, he said he’s very much open to doing that, but he didn’t think he’s ready yet. He also said he’s afraid to go down that path because it might release some inner demons and drag me down with him.

Another thing Jay told me was that ever since Rosie was born, he felt an instant and deep connection and a sense of responsibility for her, even when he was just a teenager that time. He said that having Rosie in his life made him realize how much he wanted to be a father when he's older. However, since the incident, he’s afraid of messing things up again, so he never really considered having kids from then on despite really wanting to do so. I then reassured him that we’re on the same page on this. Although I also want to have kids with him in the future, I don’t want to force it on him when he’s not yet ready.

He also said that whenever he sees me with Ana (my niece), he gets kinda jealous because he wants to join us every time. However, he constantly reminds himself to keep his distance just to be safe. I told him he doesn’t have to worry about that, and that he’s more than welcome to join us if he wants to. I also told him that my sister and the rest of my family actually considers him a part of our family, just to reassure him more.

Jay tried to lighten the mood by joking and saying now that I know everything about him and still didn’t break up with him, I could finally expect a proposal anytime soon. We both had a good laugh, but we agreed to wait for his recovery first before getting engaged or discussing our future family.

PART 3: BETH

During our discussion, Jay also had another heartbreaking revelation. He said that during the height of the pandemic, Beth’s husband (Brian) reached out to him. Brian said that Beth had COVID and was confined in a hospital, and that he was already running low on funds due to bills and unemployment. He also said that Beth had been almost catatonic since Rosie’s passing. She had been resistant to any outside and professional help, but she was institutionalized for about a year after a self-harming incident. For the past decade, she’d been cold, distant, and withdrawn from society.

Apparently, the rest of Jay’s family also knew about all this, but again, they just swept it under the rug. To be fair, they had been helping Brian by sending financial aid to support Beth, but their version of the story was that Beth had just gone low contact since they moved. 

Also, to be very clear, Jay said that Beth never blamed him for what happened to Rosie, although he initially felt that way when he was younger. It was more of their parents interpreting and spinning things a certain way to avoid tarnishing their family’s reputation, but when Brian reached out to him directly years ago, he started to understand better. However, he still hasn’t processed everything, and he still partly blames himself for the whole thing.

PART 4: OUR CURRENT SITUATION

For now, what we’re exploring is couple’s therapy so we can discuss our mutual issues in a safe and pressure-free space, and hopefully, kind of ease him into the world of therapy. We’ve already found the perfect therapist to help us, and we’ve now had 6 sessions with her. From what I can tell, Jay seems a lot happier and less burdened. We’ve also had “homeworks” from our sessions, and Jay was even the one reminding me to do them.

Right now, I’m just hoping that he becomes ready enough to open up about Rosie so he can heal and recover from his trauma. Not for me, but for his mental and emotional well-being. No rush though, all in his own time.

Also, Jay has no social media, but I showed him the original Reddit post I made. He spent like three hours reading through all the comments. It was the first time I saw him get teary-eyed because he never expected so many people giving him support and saying kind words to him. He was extremely overwhelmed by everyone’s kindness, so we’re both grateful to all of you for that. We also saw some TikTok and YouTube versions of the story, and you bet Jay browsed through all of them. He’s still baffled why the TikTok versions have Minecraft or cooking videos in the background, but I just told him it’s a trend haha

So, there, if you've made it this far into our story, thank you for your time! I have a good feeling that Jay and I are going to be fine. We still have a lot of challenges ahead of us, but here's to hoping for the best!

EDIT: So Jay and I now kinda share this account. He might reply directly from time to time (this is his first time on Reddit, so please be kind to him. I had to explain to him what OP and a lot of the other lingo mean haha). Yeah, but we're both reading everything! Again, thank you for being so kind!

**Relevant Comments** 

**Daemon48:** I hope Jay continues healing, and eventually Beth somehow gets out of the mental hole she’s in. Both them went through something horrible that no one who hasn’t been in that situation can comprehend. Thoughts for both of them

> **OOP:** Thank you for your kind words. As for Jay, I can see that he's already making some progress, even though it's more like baby steps. Nonetheless, it is still progress. As for Beth, I can't even begin to imagine what she's going through. I just pray that she finally finds some peace eventually.

**OOP on why Jay’s family chose to keep this as a secret**

> **OOP:** I won't make excuses for them. On a human, personal level, they are extremely lovely, generous, and kind people. They have welcomed me as a part of their family, and they even extended help when my sister's daughter, Ana, had congenital health problems. I have met different relatives of my exes before, and in comparison, Jay's family has been the most wonderful and welcoming.
> 
> However, I would say that they are a product of the very traditional, nonprogressive area in which we live. We are a Catholic community, and most activities revolve around our parish. Reputation is everything, yet town gossip is still very rampant. I understand that this may sound backward-thinking in our modern times, but that is the reality of our lives (I also grew up in the same area, so I fully understand their behavior).
>
> Although I agree with you that everything that happened and how they reacted to it had been unfortunate to say the least, and Jay and Beth got the brunt of it.

**OOP on how Jay’s sister, Beth, is dealing with the grief process and if she has received therapy to deal with her daughter’s death in better ways**

> **OOP:** Beth has recovered from COVID, so she's physically fine now. However, she's still mentally detached and has gone back to her almost catatonic state. Jay suggested couples therapy to Beth's husband after experiencing it firsthand, but we don't have an update on it yet.
> 
> Also, thank you so much for your insights. You said a lot of sensible things that we never knew (both Jay and I were clueless about therapy and psychology in general), so we actually learned new things from what you said. Jay says he appreciates you and is extremely grateful, and so am I!

"For the youth, just broad strokes what I've learned after 20 years investing.","#DON'T PANIC

(This was my response to a young investor here. Thought I might just post it, I like to lurk but whatever. Some edits have been made.)

For what it is worth this is my advise:

SAVING IS HARD. Unless you were born to wealth it is hard. Sometimes even saving $5 is hard, and as you climb up in life there are always new things you will see to spend your money on. 

#1 if you see money laying on the ground PICK THAT UP. IT'S FREE MONEY. People throw money down because they don't know what money is really worth or what money can do. PICK IT UP AND POCKET THAT. NEVER THROW MONEY DOWN, NOT EVEN A PENNY. Damn, I hate seeing money on the ground. Even that penny was some time or labor earned, dont disregard that time and labor. 


::
# I cant believe I have to edit this, but some idiot brought it up: If you find a large some of money laying on the ground take it to your local police station. Check your local laws to determine what the minimum amount would be for your state/jurisdiction most are between $500 and $10,000. If you find it in a bag with drugs... well, you do you. 

::

I was really just talking about pocket change 

Try to use your money earned to make you happy, but put some back. Even if it is only $5 this week, but you wanted to go out and have a good steak. 

If you did not grow up with a family that knows how money works you need to educate yourself.

This is NOT thought [edit: or taught] in school. 

You either need family to teach you or you will have to learn on your own. Go to your library and read finance books, subscribe to some financial magazines, and watch YouTube, or go to broker sites and go through their online education stuff. TDA (not that I'm a fan of them or anything), Fidelity both have some good reading and watching. 

My grandfather was born in the great depression to a pretty poor family, joined the navy, became a cop and spent 1960 (he was 30 when this got intresting to him) till the day he died, investing and trying to learn this shit and tried to teach me what he found out, and I have spent the last 20+ years doing it too. I've gotten pretty good at what I can find and I'm 41, still think I'm not all that good at it, but I could still just say F it and retire today if I wanted to. Make no mistake, if you do not have generational support you have a lot to do, make sure you pass on what you learn. I try to educate my friends and family that will listen, but I feel like a blowhard sometimes. 

Go to seminars, or online live stuff. Learn the financial products and how to use them. Learn how to read company financials and how to interpret it. 

None of this takes a huge amount of time. Spend 5 or 10 hours a week doing this instead of watching tv, reading fantasy, playing games (or working, fuck the man).  

In 1 year you will be ahead of 90% of others. 

Don't believe what financial media is telling you, by the time you hear it from them it's already over and the big boys are looking for bag holders. You have to learn how to do your own due diligence. Never believe anything you can't verify.  Pretty sure CrMer was shouting to buy lemanbrothers in 2008... that worked out well?

Broad market ETFs are seeming more and more like those bundled loan securities pre 2008. Looks like we might see more losers than winner soon, but I could be wrong.... do your research. 

I like managed funds. Vanguard and Fidelity have their reputation for a GOOD reason, and they have their own clearing houses. 

Pick a solid broker, read above. 

#Get a ROTH and max it before anything else, then standard IRA, then brokerage. Try hard as hell to get 6 months or 1 year of savings to cover basic expenses. 

Don't be afraid to gamble a little every now and then, but don't make a r/WSB yolo 90% of your portfolio. Unless that's your risk tolerance... investing really is ALL ON YOU. (You can [and I have] make good money on a meme stock, but pIck an entry and exit; you do NOT need a 1000% gain, a 10% gain is PROFIT, AND PROFIT: IS PROFIT.)

Start with managed ETFs, mutual funds, then maybe some passive ETFs that track indexes. Then, Once you  have your feet wet, and have some cash in savings (don't forget that inflation will take cash out of your pocket, but a market correction could take more [it's a balancing act]) Try some stock picking.

After you have set yourself up  try picking some stocks. Look long term, 10+ years. I like inovationers or solid old companies that just truck along and pay dividends. Healthcare, biotech, chips, multifamily REITs are what I'm in. Go global too. 

Maybe after you are set long term, try short term picks. It really is all about risk and risk tolerance. 

After you have a little bank roll sell some options. Sell cash covered puts for stocks you like or own and want more of for a lesser price. Sell covered calls on stocks you have, and this can lower your cost basis.  

Don't do naked calls, dont short sell. Avoid Infinite risk, but know what your risk is and go for it if you think you might have a win. 
If you bet $500 on a play that could get you 5k I call that an ok gamble, IF you can take a $500 risk. 

If you are not from a family already rich now, its about getting rich in 10, 20, or 30 years. Save now. Learn how this works, have capital for down turns (buy dips and crashes), and ride the waves. This is a lot easier if you are young and have the time to ride it out while you wage slave. 

Look at any chart of any index over 20 or 30 or even 100 years, guess what ..... stocks go up.

Don't try to out think the market. Go with the flow. Follow the waxing and waning. Markets move through rotations just like tides in the sea. Move with it, not against it. 

#DONT PANIC. 

Don't trade with emotion, do your due diligence and analysis, and. stick. to. your. plan.

Learn how to make a budget and include your investments into it.

Buy 1 or 2 realestate properties. Everything you invest after purchase price is considered a loss and can offset your tax burden (even if it adds value).


Learn some hedges. I take a 1% stake against my positions with 1yr puts or calls every year. If I'm down in a year I'll take a 1% value call option. If I'm up I'll take a 1% put a year out. Its like insurance. And believe me, it CAN and WILL save your ass. 

Time in the market vs timing the market ... time in always wins, but having bad timing can set you back a long time. 

Anyway, at the end of the day... just do something. 

Do not disregard other avenues of investment either. Realestate, income property, land, art, farms, cattle (it's a big one where I'm from), antiques, clasic cars (but that might be over after all the boomers are gone [I'm gen X and still remember the smell of them (and that is a real thing kids)]. 

Try not to fall into investment fads.

When I was a kid these collectors thought these stupid bennie baby things and pogs were for life.... if those dumb*sses would have bought $AAPL instead they wouldn't still have tubs of useless, multicolored, cute cotton, whatever animal like things they would have yachts. Those damb card games are another one, yes I do have some Magic gathering cards worth some money, but I didn't buy it as an investment, I was a geek who liked playing the game with my friends.

And buy some $GME. Even 2 shares. That shit is crazy, who knows what will happen.


*I am not a financial advisor, I'm just a dude on the internet sharing what he has learned. Nothing should be taken as any type of financial advise, but everyone should save some money and invest with using their own risk tolerance and the help of a certified financial adviser (not me).*

Let’s talk about vampiring,"So you may have seen the highly upvoted post of a man proposing to his girlfriend as she crosses the finish line of her marathon.

Most people seem to see it on the surface - happy couple getting engaged at a huge milestone moment. But whose moment is it really?

She trained for months, ran 26 miles, feels like she’s dying after completing a gargantuan physical feat *and as she’s finishing a race that pushes anyone to their limits, her to-be fiancé is LITERALLY kneeling on the finish line.*

He didn’t run from the sidelines to surprise her as she walked off, he positioned *himself* as the end goal and reward for her efforts. She had to even run past him and turn him around to finish her race 💀 And they stayed hugging on the finish line long enough for the video to cut to show another racer’s finish completely blocked by this guy’s choices. The fucking audacity.

I don’t know this couple; but the fact that he didn’t let her have her victory moment is a HUGE red flag.

Every time she is asked about that marathon, it’ll segue into HIS story about the proposal. Even on her running Instagram, images of this proposal are pinned first and receive the most engagement. 

He did nothing except kneel there; but he’s absorbed most of the social praise for her literal years of efforts. MAJOR narcissism fuel.

You can stretch the analogy further to see how ridiculous and inappropriate it is:

Imagine you’ve graduated from your Master’s and just as you’re mounting the stage to accept your degree and shake the Dean’s hand; your girlfriend approaches from the other side of the stage and kneels in front of the dean with a ring.

You still graduated; but everyone is talking about you getting proposed to EVEN MORE than your graduation because you have completed your feat; but now there’s such a bright future to look forward to with you two getting married *CONGRATULATIONS girlfriend, you’re so lucky to have such a smart fiancé.*

💀💀💀

It’s a more subtle form of emotional abuse; but those who have lived through narcissism know it well. Your achievements are either discredited and dismissed or flipped in a way that the narcissist can take credit for them.

I learned reading that thread that marathon proposals are becoming a bit of a thing. Because of how AFAB people are socialized, we may dismiss it and feel happy in the moment to welcome those we love into our achievement. Women’s achievements, especially physical ones are constantly downplayed and undermined. You can bet 99% of the time, it’s not a woman squatting on the finish line of her boyfriend’s marathon. 

Keep an eye out. Is anyone sipping from your self confidence cup?

"Sup, apetards! I've been DOING some fundamental ANALysis recently and diving DEEP into my most favorite stock of all time - which is surely GEEMEEE - and in the process it accumulated into a fking ULTIMATE ENDGAME GODTIER DD. Enjoy the read! [APEFRIENDLY] Part I 💎 🙌 🚀 🌕 🪐 🌌","I have to warn you, this is a super duper long read and it will take a considerable amount of your time as well as about 140% (several estimations state that the percentage might even be as high as 420-696.9%) of brain resources. However, it is completely worth it, I promise you - ape transcendence is imminent upon completing the reading.

My fundamental idea behind this colossal piece of work was to build a framework for myself (and other interested apes), as to be aware of where it all stands now, how it all got here, and the likely outcomes of this spectacular show you have all been observing and participating in. Furthermore, I tried my best to make the language as simple as possible, using **ELIA**s (**E**explain **L**ike **I**'m an **A**pe) where possible, and doing my best in elaborating on difficult financial concepts and terms for this intellectually limited individuals with extraordinary small brain capacity that you all are. This work is structured in such a way so that even with zero knowledge in the subject, you will be able to grasp all of the important concepts from the first go. It is especially important for the newcomers of this sub, influx of whom might happen should any major potential catalyst unveil (e.g. earnings next week). So, do not hesitate to share this even with 1/10 brain-wrinkled individuums. I believe in your mental capabilities apemeisters (though, I know that at this point it is a pure gamble).

And yeah, this a not a financial advice, and I am not a financial advisor. Just and ape with one and a half brain wrinkles.

The story addressed is as old as this world, and it involves greed, manipulation, exploitation, corruption and decay; as well as unity, bravery (abreast retardation), optimism, support and and creative forces. The eternal battle of good and evil, no matter how corny it sounds. Compulsory buckle up and eat a crayon apefriend, that's going to be a ride!

&#x200B;

# Chapter I. The Short, the Squeeze and the Ugly

&#x200B;

The story begins with a hedge fund (HF from here on), and there is really nothing particular about this HF. For general understanding of an ape that knows nothing: ""A **hedge** **fund** is an investment partnership - the marriage of a fund manager and investors who pool their money together into the fund, with the objective of earning active return."" - The **game** is that simple, thanks, Inve **stop** edia, you are always spot on! The HF might have been named by whichever name exists, it really does not matter for history. What is actually important, is the setting in which it operated, and the rules, according to which this HF played (and also exploited). In this particular case, the antagonist is called Melvin Capital Management LP (MC thereafter). However, I would encourage you not to get attached to names; but instead view the antagonist as a collective image, as an intrusive parasite, which appears as soon as a suitable environment exists for that. And where there is one parasite, there will come many.

&#x200B;

**""ButT wat did di Hedgehogs do so that ther is sO mutch indiEgnation boUt t?""**

You are asking the right questions here, my little ape-man fellow. Only the lazy haven't scolded the HF, and as a matter of fact there are solid grounds to do so. Briefly, the antagonists exploited the loophole (do not confuse with the loop hole in your head, apemeister) in the short selling mechanism, which effectively allowed them to severely manipulate the market for their benefit. Furthermore, the bad guys have been doing that for years and even decades. GME is a very indicative, even whistleblowing example of the wrongdoing being done. All of these issues will be Dug Deeper into and discussed in detail further on, but let me start from the basics for half-wrinkled beginner apes to catch up with us, one whole wrinkle elitists.

**SHORT SELLING ELIA.** You are a smart entrepreneurial ape, and you obtained the information that led you to believe that the banana market will be aplenty this year and as a result the prices will drop significantly. The ape progress is so advanced, that you are able to enter a contractual relationship with another apedividual. This guy is known to have a big bulk of bananas just laying around, so you use this opportunity to borrow those for a period of time and agree to give it back later with the premium. The other ape sees you as a credible partner (understandable, as you went to Apeuke University and received MBA there - Master of Banana Appreciation degree)  thus lending you 100 bananas for one ape dollar each. You then rush to the local ape banana market 'ooh ooh ahh ahh'-ing all the way in great cheer for what a businessape apemomma raised. You sell the goods for $100 and wait. Because your due diligence was apegod-tier, the plan worked and one banana now costs 0.5 ape dollars. You then buy 100 banananas back from the market for $50 and give it back to the apelender, as well as a small premium agreed upon previously. ???? **PROFIT!!!!** (of about 50 bucks)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qu370t0oaeo61.jpg?width=503&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0d39a211695b7ddc8d6b260a38759f0d406aaa56

However, the example above only illustrates the perfect world, where all apes are honest apes and the ape market does not have inefficiencies. The current problem with short selling is that at one moment GME had  [the highest percentage of float shorted in the world](https://www.investopedia.com/short-sellers-lose-usd5-05-billion-in-bet-against-gamestop-5097616), amounting to about 140% (and by many it is considered to be a rookie number, even currently). Yes, it does mean that more shares were sold short than shares existed. It is a big issue, let's discuss it in detail. One important point before we dive deeper, though. Lately I saw many honorable 'traders' (yes, used as an anagram here again) in comments criticizing short process as a whole, viewing it negatively and in some extreme examples even advocating the prohibition of it. At this point it is important to mention that short selling is an integral part of the markets for a variety of reasons. In addition to creating liquidity to help make a market, short selling allows people to benefit from a stock price going down (as explained in the bananas ELIA above) leveling the playing field for those looking to make all types of investments. Short selling is an essential component of market stability (as long as it is not exploited, surely): hence sometimes longs are blinded by euphoria and optimism and there’s no one to hold these companies feet to the fire, short sellers look at companies with a bit more of a critical eye than the average investor. Ooh, I'm starting to sound like a 🌈🐻, so forgive me permabullapes, as I have sinned, forgetting and ignoring the only **auti** postulate to live by here, and that is: ""STONKS ONLY GO UP"".  


**""k Shortz IMPOrTENT but hoW iZ 140% bananana sell? Ape iNfinit maniy go BrrrRrr?""**

Yeah, you caught it right, smoothie-brainie. The main components to that are so-called IOUs, settlement cycles, leverage, excessive borrowing, failures to deliver, and, most importantly:

https://preview.redd.it/mddcarby2do61.jpg?width=1902&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=55062b46247cc958f8f1dd66cb03a0200a60ccb3

I am sorry that your head exploded after looking at the words aforementioned above, I really am! But this is how the evolution works, and you just fell victim to it. Nevermind, just collect the shattered pieces of your brain (about two grams, should not take long), put it back into the empty vessel that your head is, and fix it with some duct tape, I dunno. Jokes aside, let's continue, and now I will explain the cornerstone concepts of IOU obligations (abbreviation of I Owe You) as well as FTDs (failures to deliver), as these will be prevalent through the entire discussion. Starting from the basics first.

**IOUs ELIA**. Your ape grandma lived a busy life and she has a lot of ape-dollars as her savings. She heard about the banana price increase hype as everyone's been talking about it, so she decided to buy some for her own. Luckily, there is a decent broker called Bananality, and because she feels like really shaking the old days, she YOLOs all her savings into the bananas of BanaNonStop Corp. So far so good? 🐻 with me. As soon as apema pays for the banana stock, the money and the bananas have to change hands, and this is called 'settlement'. In many ape countries money and bananas change hands two days after the trade, and that is called 'T+2'. Ideally, this processes have to take place simultaneously. But in the current ape financial system bananas are divorced from money, thus her money may settle independently of  bananas settlement. Before the trade settles, ape grandma will be holding banana IOUs on her account, and importantly these are IOUs for BANANAS, not for money. Furthermore, the system sees her IOUs as normal stock bananas. In the perfect ape world, the blockage clears up after T+2, and  Bananality is able to send the banana stock through the system and the IOUs are wiped out.

**Failures to Deliver (FTDs) ELIA**. Now let's imagine that apema was not so lucky in choosing her broker and ran into a crook, who wants to deliberately exploit the system of settlement and the broker is called Bananaked. The grandma enters the trade, the money settles, however, something blocks Bananaked from settling its shares through the system. And this something is nothing but a malicious intent, as all the the broker did was issuing banana IOU's with no real intention of covering it according to the rules. It might even be the case, that Bananaked never held those shares which he sold. If at the moment of T+2 settlement the IOUs are not covered by the banana stocks, it creates a deliberate, strategic failure to deliver. This is how the loophole is exploited, generally (still, not as bad as your hole is exploited, though). Well, fuck you, Bananaked, you will be dealt with later for messing up with apema, mark my ape word!  


**""My brraIn hurtz caN i go home PleZ?""**

Puts on your brain then. Just eat a banana, or a Crayon, you will be fine... Allrighty, you convinced me. Lets dive out of theory and discuss GAMEEESTOOOOP, finally! We will jump back to the concepts elaborated upon above as soon as the context is necessary for that. Here, Wen Moon got your back and he will cheer you up for your dedication in reading!  


[\\""Camon ape ya can do it, read and evolve!\\"" - Wen Moon.](https://preview.redd.it/z45wnj697eo61.jpg?width=461&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7f1f32bf4ea435f7ab3a02cdc597350da2e7a18c)

**""oKay i candO yit, fUkc mah braIn wit moore nowledge mtfakeRr!""** \- an ape.

That's the approach I needed. Remember about antagonist MC? No, not the one who performed at your ape party yesterday and did it pretty bad. I'm talking about Melvin Capital. So, the main story line begins in 2014, the year when MC started to short the stock that I like very, very much. Gabe Plotkin, MC manager stated that fact proudly himself, during the first Congressional Hearing. Let's take a look at the chart of GME.  


[GME Monthly Chart](https://preview.redd.it/nioeif5egeo61.png?width=1759&format=png&auto=webp&s=bba603499f76e15be530304345379043a7edf545)

As you may see, the chart covers a relatively long period of time, and the big red REKTangle here highlights the obvious steady downward trend. From the current outlook on things, it is obvious that MC made a correct financial decision, shorting the stock from its highs of about $45 a share, all the way down to about 3 dollars per share diapason starting in the middle of 2019. That is a whooping gain of more than ninety(90)!!! %, or more than forty dollars per share gain! Impressive numbers, aren't they? Yeah, you won: you were right betting against the company; you've mad shit tons of money; your wife's boyfriend accepted your dominance as an alpha 'trader' (anagram) ape and voluntarily left the family, now FIX YOUR FUCKING PROFITS AND CLOSE YOUR POSITION! Why did the shorters not cover when they had a perfect opportunity window for that LASTING SEVERAL FUCKING YEARS? Because of [the bankruptcy jackpot](https://finance.zacks.com/worthless-stocks-tax-deductible-4986.html).

As it was explained previously short selling is an important market instrument and it may deliver net decent profits for investors who effectively juggle the risk; the 'bankruptcy jackpot' is a rare occurrence which promises a much larger pay off if successful. And it is an extremely risky bet, the one that only the epic 'traders' are willing to undertake (so, to some extent it is possible to say, that MC belongs to WSB). The HFs were driven by the fact, that in the event of insolvency, any collateral provided to back up the shorted shares is returned to the short seller; furthermore, as it is no longer necessary to return the shares shorted, the shortist takes it all, the whole profit. Before the Ryan Cohen updates, the consensus and market sentiment on the greatest stock of all time was severely grim. So, why not go all in if you already won it all (MC reasoning)?

&#x200B;

So, they decided to YOLO...  


https://preview.redd.it/9t6r0s1sueo61.jpg?width=931&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e7f3826aefe16abb9ece9a4125387b2f57102180

And this is where a shitshow of an unimaginable scale begins to uncover...

\[Apetards, I found myself working on this post for two days in a row, investing my whole weekend into this beautiful memeful research, and I fucking regret nothing! However, as it is already 00:00 of Mon 22nd in my time zone and there is some work to be done tomorrow and through the working week, I decided to hurry up and intensify the narration finishing this post a little bit faster. Furthermore, I also see it to be necessary to split the story, which initially was intended to be a one bulky post, into several chapters and posts. Apeace!\]  


**""WhatT hapenT nExt telL meh pliz ya cheeKY wahnKerR!1?""**

When a general market sentiment changes from negative to positive, it is usually a bad idea to bet against it. Even WSB 'traders' understand this fundamental principle, and this is where you, Mr. 'Trader', started to outplay the 'Big Guys'. Literally, the HFs fell victim to their own relentless greed and stupidity, and the did it spectacularly. More precisely:

# Preface:

The game that is being played is not simply *just* a House of Cards. I’d argue that it's ***far larger*** *(no heat towards attobit, luv ur material, wouldn’t be here without it, truly <3).* The massive entities we call the Big Banks, the Market Makers, the Short dicked Hedge-funds, The Fed, etc, do not simply fall down over the course of a day. No...I’d argue that when they fail..they come crashing down from their **Castle of Glass.** One that has been forming cracks throughout its structure ***since the day it was conceived.***  A deteriorating castle which can **no longer be unseen, nor..undone. Only, replaced.**

Before we get to the **solution** though, you must first understand the **core aspect of the problem. To highlight this problem, I’ll be referring to a post that is an** ***absolutely essential read*** **so the second half of this post makes sense.** (You’ll find it below in a minute)

I’ll break everything down in the simplest way I can so you have an idea of what you’re walking into. Just know we’re going to be discussing ***everything*** **from the OP, his** ***name***, ETFs, RRPs, NFTs, and the glorious three words, which may very well tie them all together. ***Game on, Anon.***

So without further ado,

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part I: The Crux

This post is a follow-up to my previous. I had attempted to shine some light onto a DD that was flying far too under the radar for the God-Tier level of information contained within it. It was posted roughly a month ago. It was unlike any I had read before it and till this day, continues to be unlike any I have read since. I’m talking thermonuclear level of information here.

This is the case for a few reasons. I’ll outline them below so you have a brief understanding to start. (I’ll also be quoting/referencing myself from my other post a few times to save time, so if you see similarities, just know I’m a lazy fuk).

1. **The author:** The OP behind this DD went by the name, u/leavemeanon. Shortly after dropping this thermonuclear analysis on ***HOW*** the shares have been suppressed and ***WHERE*** they are most likely located. He vanished, but unlike the Avatar’s flake ass, his job was done.
2. **The Job:** ***exposing the primary methods of fuckery utilized by the short gang, the Big Banks, and even the Fed...down to the BONE.*** The depth of analysis here is ***still*** astounding, but that’s not even the kicker..its the fact he drops a God tier DD and makes a claim like this:

https://preview.redd.it/d8jzjtoabva71.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9ccf8a5566e11d5888fd341d6e166f7b7abd40e

u/leavemeanon's DD:   [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nt8ot8/rip\_uleavemeanon\_where\_are\_the\_shares\_part\_1/?utm\_medium=android\_app&utm\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nt8ot8/rip_uleavemeanon_where_are_the_shares_part_1/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

The profundity of the statement in yellow is something that you will ***only understand if you read his post.*** The likely realization you’ll come to once you do is that there is absolutely **no way that someone making** ***this claim***, drops a DD with this kind of analysis, then just goes off and deletes his account.

Self quote: “When asking myself, why tf would someone go this far into a DD analysis and delete their account shortly after? Along with going by the name u/leavemeanon, I found myself coming to the same conclusion each time:

***This. is. what. this. guy. does. He might as well be an unofficial whistle-blower who wanted no traces back to him, bc the info contained in his DD is PRECISELY what is occurring right now.”***

I wrote this statement on my previous DD just over a month ago. I want you guys to pay special attention to that last sentence because if you read through that post, you’ll realize one more thing.

**It’s not only** ***still*** **dead on, but becoming even MORE relevant in relation to the events it had described a whole-ass** ***month back.***

Now if you haven’t read the post for some dingle reason..I’ll provide you OP’s ELI5 to give a snippet of the **problem**, b/c if we do not understand the ***problem,*** **then the** ***solution*** **will not make sense.**

https://preview.redd.it/n5ip59aebva71.png?width=701&format=png&auto=webp&s=40195985c771721e9bee3991756ce5c50fc418ab

So where does the problem truly lie? Based on OP’s post. It’s none other, than **the fuckin ETFs.**  OP explains the inner workings of the ETFs in a way I’ve never seen anyone do before. He even links this video for us real special apes, to understand.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iX7fOx5G40A&t=323s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iX7fOx5G40A&t=323s)

So assuming you now understand the problem, here’s an idea of the **severity**, as disclosed within part 3 of OP’s post. Spoiler alert,

https://preview.redd.it/m5n89zofbva71.png?width=707&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca519452d537ca0351a7629bddd9999c5baad4c1

We’re not done yet, remember..only once you understand the ***full extent of the problem, will the solution make sense.*** So to add even more juice to the flame, here’s a video by **Charlie Vid’s**, which he released on July 10th. It shows how all those **RRPs**...you know..those multi-fuckin billion dollar funds being moved around on a **daily basis...are likely piled** ***right into the fuckin E T F’s.***

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhS5FgfO6Jg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhS5FgfO6Jg)

This video has only stood to further validate the point u/leavemeanon **made a whole ass month back.** The information he’s discussing is still pretty novel and needs more eyes, but the connection he makes in that video is hard to argue against. Even if you don’t fully grasp wtf that shit means, and let's be honest, most of us still don't b/c RRPs are the most absurdly convoluted thing on this planet. Nonetheless, the big picture is pretty evident. From this video, it seems almost entirely plausible that these transactions between the Fed and the other end of the parties involved (the Big Banks) are being done illegally at historic levels, to ***keep the entire market from collapsing.***

To provide a better idea of what *may* be going on here, I'm going to refer to someone who seems to have a far clearer grasp on these transactions than myself. I'm fine with speculating on most things but these RRPs though, I'm way too smooth-brained for that and the last thing I need is to be throwing a 69th definition of what they mean into the mix.

https://preview.redd.it/mekm0acibva71.png?width=1121&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8f9d7886b1e931915999abfb6c7122d45a71567

This may also explain why most of the rules released in relation to the derivatives market seem to have only slowed down recent events, but not much more. I'm saying this because the way some of those rules were written, they sounded like they would dice up the short's plan of approach completely. Though there does ***seem*** to be a clear impact on how GME has been trading since most of the rules were implemented, ***they haven't ended the game.*** To me, this likely means that the greatest source of fuckery held by Shortgang and Co. lies elsewhere.

The Married-puts, the dark pools, or whatever else method of manipulation these limp-dick cum-dumpsters have up their sleeves may be *some* of the better-known gears behind their scheme, but I'm willing to be ***it's the ETFs, which are the true source of their Fuckery.*** **These transactions described in the video above, and further theorized upon by the comment attached, are occurring** ***through the entire ETF market.***

# Part II - The Connection

Now that you understand the problem, we are *almost* cleared to move onto the solution. Before going further, I need to provide some context here.  My previous post, as mentioned earlier, was intended for a single purpose: Shedding light on u/leavemeanon’s DD. Shortly after dropping it though, I received a comment and message from a few users who sent me down one hell of a rabbit hole. As in that post, I was making some tin-foil hat connections to the meaning behind u/leavemeanon's username. Though this part may not necessarily even be linked, it's important I mention it because had it not happened, I would not have discovered what I believe to be the ***solution***.

Moving forward from here, we’re going to be **treading over some speculative waters** and more than likely, be testing that 4-hour erection window before you need to call your doctor. They might have to raise the bar on that one if the following of what I’ve found is ***even remotely correct.***

This part may sound absurd at first, but I only ask you to trust me until you reach part 3. For most of part 2, I'm explaining because I feel it important to clarify *how I came to my conclusions.* My thoughts in this section don't necessarily *have* to be true, and I wouldn't be surprised to find out if this ends up being the case in the future.

That being said, ***their relevance in this DD is that of an intermediate***. They are what helped me discover what I believe to be **the** ***solution for the problem described above.***

My speculative journey would lead me down an immense rabbit hole roughly a month ago. It would begin with a fascination with Anon's DD but soon evolved to also include **the method of its deployment (OP deleting his account shortly after dropping it), the technical but extremely concise language utilized, and the structure of its writing,** as I began to ponder the ***meaning behind OP's name***.

The now-deleted user, who went by the name of **'leavemeanon""** would ring a few bells for another ape, that would comment the following on my post:

It was at this point that I began to speculate whether there was a connection between Anon's name and the phrase above found on Gamestop's NFT website. Now I cannot state that there is a direct relation between the two, but I find it necessary to shed light on the connection I theorized (with the help of some amazing apes), regarding what ***I believed it to be.***

what if, the now-deleted OP's name was in reference to more than just 'leave me anonymous'? What if...OP's name was an attempt to send us a message about the material covered in his post in regard to the ETF market?

Here is the likely-to-be unlikely link: the word Anon is defined as ""soon, shortly"". OP went by the name LeaveMeAnon. I.e leave me '***soon, shortly'.*** So naturally, I went full tin-foil mode and chased the idea further down the hole. I made the following assumption in doing so, what if OP was telling us,

""the material I'm covering, the current ETF market as we know it, is to be ***left behind soon/shortly, and let me explain why""***

Whereas '**Game on, Anon',** a phrase located throughout Gamestop's NFT website, if used under the same pretense, could refer to ***""Game on, Soon/shortly"".***

So the link that would bring me to the absurdly coincidental connection that may, or may not have been fueled by an unhealthy amount of confirmation bias at the time:

Anon's post is created with knowledge equitable to damn near Burry himself, with the sole purpose of exposing where the ***true problem lies*** in the GME saga. He mentions married-puts, high-frequency trading, and ETFs in-depth to show this. Yet, it is the **latter most issue that gets the largest emphasis placed on it. Why do I believe that?**

**Primarily because the more I looked into this situation, the more I began to see that the institutions involved on the short side of GME aren't the Castle of glass, they simply** ***live in it***. The Castle itself...is the entire ***ETF market.*** A structure which throughout and within it have become increasingly prevalent by the passing of each day. They are quite literally, ***a legal method of naked shorting***.

Where Anon takes the time to reveal the problem, it's **Gamestop**, the company itself, that has quite literally been showing us the ***solution to this problem.*** All of which it has been doing through its ***actions, not its words.***

# Part III - The Solution

If you made it this far, just know I'm proud :')

Part II is certainly the most tin-foil section in this post, but as you proceed through part III, you'll soon realize why I found it necessary to provide all that information. This is certainly my favorite part. Stick through to the end and you'll see why we save the best, for last.

Moving forward right where we left off - If you go onto that same NFT website, copy the link which is posted on their NFT page, paste it into google, and open the first tab from the etherscan website and click on the ‘contracts tab’, guess what you’ll find there...

https://preview.redd.it/jxoamqoubva71.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cfd14b858ebc799988785f0d3027a396fa882c0

Still, think it’s a simple coincidence? It's alright, I mean ""it’s not it actually means anything…***” right Anakin?”.....\*zooms in closer\*.....” right..?\****

Lol don’t actually try to zoom in, there isn’t shit there if you do that. **But… third time’s a charm, right? what if there's more to that phrase than just some random ass meaning?**

To find out, I did some more digging around that term after finding the above which would lead me to find the following tweet:

[https:\/\/acceleratedcapital.substack.com\/p\/the-metaverse-index-](https://preview.redd.it/cd98leowbva71.png?width=553&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea0407b3e9d5604fc6ac1d7b60cbbb6fc87a9eb4)

That phrase...look familiar? Yeah...we’re about to enter solution territory...and for you “I only believe after a 4th, 5th, 6th coincidence” apes, don't worry. I’ll get there anon ;)

The link above will take you directly to the page they’ve shown. Upon finding this tweet, I looked into what exactly these guys were talking about. After reading in-depth about what exactly this ‘Metaverse’ is, as well as viewing some of the other links they have posted on their website, you’ll find information about its relation to **NFTs,** ***Blackrock***, and something known as the **Index Cooperative**.

Now, why exactly are these things all noteworthy? Well, if you don’t live under a rock and are a certified retarde like yours truly, you’ll remember **some hype going around with Gamestops NFT plans.** But before we get to that, let’s put this together in a cascading manner so you fully grasp what we’re looking at here.

What is the ***Metaverse*** exactly?

* Per Wikipedia: “***The Metaverse is a collective, virtual shared space, created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical reality and physically persistent virtual space, including the sum of all virtual worlds, augmented reality, and the internet”***
* It’s further described as a basket of 15 tokens that serve the purpose of capturing entertainment trends, sports, and business shifting to virtual reality.
* The next absolutely fascinating find in regard to the Metaverse index is one that requires you to zoom out and view the bigger picture. By doing so, you'll begin to understand ***what it's trying to change***.  An article that goes extremely in-depth on it would provide this insight:

[https:\/\/www.masterthemeta.com\/business-breakdowns\/into-the-void](https://preview.redd.it/7i3kzk8ccva71.png?width=706&format=png&auto=webp&s=3abb9f88659f7c106282ee174f6d2119e46d22c9)

This article above (absolutely excellent read btw) is what links our **topic of focus. N F Ts.**  Notice the **black-highlighted sections, primarily** ***the bottom one.***

This information takes us back to Accelerated Capitals website. Here we find a bit more relative information to ***virtual ownership via NFTs, gaming,*** ***virtual reality, and entertainment""***, as well as the **inclusion criteria it has before an NFT can be issued under it.**

[https:\/\/acceleratedcapital.substack.com\/p\/the-metaverse-index-](https://preview.redd.it/4i82x83scva71.png?width=519&format=png&auto=webp&s=08f4ec2da4a7b72dde074e547afa210db14cf240)

I highlighted the 3 month period because if I remember correctly...there’s a company out there that has something to do with gaming, which was supposed to go bankrupt..but didn’t..and similarly ***issued an NFT token a few months back...what the date on that?*** **4/07, now I'm not the best at math but roughly 3 months since then would be...😎 (s/o** u/LordoftheEyez for the help on clarifying the timeframe!)

But let's get a bit more specific, **wtf** ***is the Metaverse Index really?***

https://preview.redd.it/cjtmbdujm3b71.png?width=560&format=png&auto=webp&s=788ec0a8d53c88bbe46d0583a634abe9bb29bf9a

Oh boy, well now we’re getting somewhere. After looking into what exactly the Metaverse index was, I found myself directed towards something called the ***Index Cooperative (Coop Index).*** Think of this thing as the **very top of the cascade, it contains** ***other blockchain-based indices within it, such as the Metaverse Index.*** Upon visiting The Index Coop website, you get a pretty baseline idea of what it is to better explain:

https://preview.redd.it/436meh2xcva71.png?width=670&format=png&auto=webp&s=61641ee1db870b93b3903a256d58400ca888144d

Just a refresher on the cascade of terms here as I explained them a bit out of order, from the highest --> lowest level of priority. (also priority here isn't me saying least is worst lol, it's simply in relation to where they actually fall relative to one another)

**Index Cooperative > Metaverse, etc > NFTs**

&#x200B;

Because this cascade functions ***entirely separate from the modern-day stock market which includes modern-day ETFs as we know them, they play by COMPLETELY different rules.***

* **It’d be an absolute shame if a company that was** ***shorted to high-hell...decided to jump ship and hop into this thermonuclear fueled fuckin rocket,*** and light up all the dipshits who decided to bet against it..
* ***A shame for those dipshits, that is.*** Fkn dingles lmayo..alright back to semi-serious mode...

Going forward, I did some deep dives through other Reddit pages to learn more about this thing, and to my surprise, I got a damn good explanation of ***what EXACTLY is the Index Coop attempting to become. It is as follows,***

https://preview.redd.it/89gttgxzcva71.png?width=351&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1fe238d385556c96a94203ddafba6fa16c01475

""**OVERVIEW OF INDEX""**

""[Index Cooperative](https://www.indexcoop.com/) is a DeFi project that’s going after the multi-trillion-dollar \[ETF\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded\_fund#:\~:text=An%20exchange%2Dtraded%20fund%20(ETF,the%20day%20on%20stock%20exchanges)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund#:~:text=An%20exchange%2Dtraded%20fund%20(ETF,the%20day%20on%20stock%20exchanges)) (exchange-traded fund) market. At its simplest, an ETF is like a basket of assets (be it stocks, bonds, commodities, or crypto) that can be traded in a group. Companies like [Blackrock (under its subsidiary iShare) and Vanguard each have over a trillion dollars](https://www.etftrends.com/10-biggest-etf-issuers-of-2019-by-market-capitalization/) under management in the form of ETFs. ETFs have been so popular, that people like [Michael Burry ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Burry)(of [*The Big Short* ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Short_(film))) have called it a “[passive investment bubble](https://www.etfstrategy.com/passive-investing-a-bubble-says-big-short-investor-michael-burry-10449/)”.""

[***https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/j8i8wp/the\_index\_cooperative\_defis\_first\_index\_fund\_now/***](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/j8i8wp/the_index_cooperative_defis_first_index_fund_now/)

Two things should stick out to you off the bat:

1. “Own the ***Blackrock*** of DeFi” while stating ***Ethereum ETFs as being a business with a multi-trillion dollar upside.***
2. *""Index Cooperative* ***is a DeFi project that's going AFTER the Muti-trillion ETF market”***

Putting these two together took a minute, I found myself asking, how tf Blackrock was thrown into the loop? so I started scavenging through a few more articles through Accelerated Capitals page and found this:

**TA:DR/conclusion:**

Let's bring all this together now, because if you've made it this far, then you're likely still taking all this in. I know, it's a lot to take in and I also understand that some of my conclusions are speculative. In the end, **this is truly all we can do until the elephant in the room gets so big, that it is no longer possible to ignore or deny it.** For this reason, I ask each and every one of my fellow apes to dig into every piece of information I've provided above and **reason these things out for themselves. Follow the evidence, question the data, question the logic, and deduce the flaws. Only then can you truly justify to yourself that the investment you've made in this stock, was done so out of confidence, and genuine Due-Diligence.**

We began by introducing the problem, because, like any other problem you wish to solve, you must first **understand the problem.** The more complex and/or convoluted that problem is, oftentimes the longer it can take to ascertain the necessary information in ***properly*** learning about it. This is something we covered in part I, in which section I introduced you to the **elephant in the room, the ETF market, or as I like to call it, The** ***Glass Castle.***

In part II, I provided insight into what I like to think of as the ***intermediate,*** between the **problem and the** ***solution.*** Though I do not have high expectations for those connections to be outright true, they did not need to be. Their purpose was served the moment they led me to find everything I wrote about in part III.

Within this final part, I described to you ***the solution***. IF I'm right in my thought process here, THEN the actions being taken by RC and Gamestop are quite literally, ***pointing in a single direction***.

**Changing the game and giving the** ***power back to the players*** **isn't just about changing the company, no...It's about shifting the ENTIRE damn landscape of how the modern-day economy functions.** This change, the NFT initiative currently being taken by GME is with damn near certainty moving towards one goal..before we describe that goal, let me provide one last refresher, but this time with analogy's so there is not a single ape left behind.

1. At the very top, you have the largest basket: the **Index Cooperative** (**think of this as the new blockchain stock market)**
2. Within this large basket, you have multiple medium-sized baskets: The **Metaverse Index, Defi-Pulse index, etc.** **(Think of this like the SP.Y)**
3. And within individual *medium-sized* baskets, you’ve got **NFT’s** **(think a jet-fueled gaming company ran by a fuckin 69D chess master)**

Imagine an economy where there is no longer a middle man, by which I mean the modern-day banking system as we know it. Ask yourself, if you had the ability to choose a completely different system, where the ***power of decision-making and investing potential lies in your hands, and not in that of some middle-man who would rather use it for his own personal benefit at the cost of YOUR losses, would you use it?***

Unlikely, I'd say. Unless you enjoy getting hoed by greedy scumbags, but you probably wouldn't have made it this far in this post had that been the case. This leaves us to the ultimate question, *what exactly is RC doing?*

Based on everything I've shown you, **He's planning on cutting out the middle-man.** These modern-day Big Banks and pretty much every other financial institution from the SEC to the Fed have been laying in bed together for decades. In doing so, they thrived within their castle while the rest of humanity continued to struggle, often unable to make even our most *basic* ends meet.

Yet in the end, it was *this* greed that blinded them. *This* greed allowed their own naivety to consume them. Most importantly, it was their unending hunger for power and wealth that created a facade so great, that they could no longer see that karma isn't a bitch. Karma is a f**uckin mirror.** This is the true cost of their ""opportunity"".

And those cracks? Each day that passes, they spread further and deeper. Its flaws can no longer be **unseen, nor can they be** ***undone.***

**Only, replaced.**

I'd argue the game isn't *about* to change...but rather,

I'd argue, **it already** **has.**

P.S Larry Cheng, GME board member, and  Matt Finestone, Blockchain guy.

None of this is financial advice, I repeat, I still do not know how to walk on all two's. Thank you for your time.

EDIT: There's a pretty fancy pants wrinkly-brained ape down in the comments who did a solid job of providing a description of the kind of changes I had envisioned while writing this DD. I didn't get around to including most of the things he's stating, but they are certainly on the same track of thought process. So, it's only right I add his comment for all apes to see. I've described the process, this is what the results, I believe, will look like,

**EDIT 2:** This post was partly inspired by this ape, I had shared my previous DD onto the post containing the video which tied the RRPs to the ETFs. Upon further conversing with this ape last night, he provided me with, what seems to be a hint and I believe, this is what he's getting at. I'm at my 20 image count but this was his statement:

""I'll drop this Easter egg on you.""

""Simplicity. Complexity is meant to hide complexity in the markets. Also meant to distance simplicity in relationships. The most complex situations are usually handed over a simple old fashion between friends...or foes. Game on Anon""

**My response, after pondering these words:**

""simplicity...simplicity in a complex situation, is leaving the complex situation entirely. Their system and all of its cracks, cannot be unseen, nor undone. To replace a system that is so evidently flawed with its complexities requires a simple solution\*, leaving it behind entirely, and creating something new.\*

""This is my take on your wise words. Game on Anon""

**TIT SLAPPIN EDIT 3:** Holy fucking. **shit. Apes, I need all eyes on this.**

**Please correct me if I'm wrong as this is out of my field.....but tell me this doesn't fuckin read the way** ***I think it reads...***

**EDIT 4:**

**Here's some insight from a pretty-wrinkled brain mode over from** ***DDintoGME***\*\*. Truly appreciate this insight, the words of the prospectus still need to be pondered upon, but this apes assessment sounds a few steps ahead of mine, please reference his post for a better idea until we can get conclusive insight!

I've crossed my assessment out but you'll still find it below, as I deem it important that any changes made or updates provided, ***are done so with complete transparency.*** This is, at the end of the day, ***what truly strengthens our resolve to hodl!***

"Are we on the verge of a new financial crisis? The GameStop case, the signals of Hedge Funds and the rise of cryptocurrencies (translated from Italian)","Hi everyone,


The other day in the post ""Italian News Article Tells of Incoming US Market Chaos"" fellow Ape u/Nixin83 posted a very interesting article that has unfortunately gone unnoticed; we thought was worth bringing it to the attention of everyone so we could have a look at it.


To give you an overview, it talks about how we might be heading towards a new market crash, GME, the signals from the Hedge Funds, liquidity and cryptocurrency.

The interesting part that sets it apart from many articles we often read, is how they acknowledge the Squeeze is still an ongoing matter that could actually fire in the next months and why according to them.


I translated it by hand as the original piece is in Italian and didn't want to risk losing anything in translation; looking forward to hear your thoughts, here it is:

#Are we on the verge of a new financial crisis? The GameStop case, the signals of Hedge Funds and the rise of cryptocurrencies

by Nicola Sindaco


##Is there a link between the GameStop case, the surge in cryptocurrency prices (primarily Bitcoin), and the recent bankruptcy of the American fund Archegos? The overexposure of financial players, made possible by the quantitative easing policies of central banks in the Covid era, and the lowering of the level of credit risk, in a context of increasing deregulation and non-regulation of the Shadow Banking sector, is increasingly attracting financial actors with a high propensity to risk, with the imminent risk of triggering a new, devastating financial crisis.


#The roots of the last crisis (and the next one?): deregulation and non-regulation


The financialization of the world economy promoted by American President Bill Clinton with the signing of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act in November 1999, which went down in history with the journalistic epithet deregulation, turns out to be the key to shedding light on the origin of latest recent global financial crisis. The deregulation repealed the Glass-Steagall Act which previously prohibited so-called BanCorp (bank holding companies) from controlling other financial institutions, marking a boundary between commercial, investment banks, Hedge Funds, other investment funds and insurance institutions, and standardizing made the enlarged banking and financial system under a single risk model.


Previously, slackening tendencies had already been in place since 1997 with the decision of the then President of the Federal Reserve (FED) Alan Greenspan to keep the derivatives market and Shadow Banking completely deregulated (i.e. the sector of investment funds and large financial institutions that act as banks without being de facto). In addition, the relaxation of the equity rule approved in April 2004 by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), repealing the text of the same 1975 law, allowed large financial institutions (with capital exceeding 5 billion dollars) to simply submit their exemption file to the SEC in order to decide autonomously its own net capital, or rather its net liquidity buffer to be used as a guarantee of solvency of the investment portfolio.


The non-regulation of Shadow Banking and the deregulation of the global financial system meant that speculative instruments such as Credit Default Swaps (CDS) could be used as balances (_hedge_) against credit risk without the parties involved having anything to do with the stipulation of the original credit / debt contract and therefore without necessarily having to own the debt instrument (share, bond or derivative). As a result, the volume of CDS increased a hundredfold in the decade 1998-2008 and the trend had already been noticed in 2003 by the famous investor Warren Buffett, the Oracle of Omaha, leading him to define the derivatives ""financial weapons of mass destruction"".


The financial crisis rooted in the aforementioned legislative choices then found fertile ground in the creative work of BanCorps, in particular in the form of subprime mortgages and derivatives such as _Collateralized Default Obligations_ (CDO) and the aforementioned Credit Default Swaps. The swelling of the American real estate bubble, the easy access to credit for banking institutions and their customers, added to the attitudes that can be placed in the grey of the law and the fraudulent attitudes of the actors involved, led the entire system to experience peaks of financial euphoria. results in overleveraging (excessive exposure to the risk of default) and subsequently in the collapse of the entire house of cards.


If deregulation has acted as a systemic catalyst, the American real estate bubble can be seen as the spark and overleveraging should be understood as an amplifier of the spread of the fire. The domino effect was such as to lead to the collapse of the American economy first and then the world one within 18 months (from the first bankruptcy due to subprime in April 2007 to the collapse of Lehman Brothers and Bear Sterns in 2008), recording in the first quarter of 2009 a violent decline of the major world stock exchanges equal to 9.8% for the Eurozone, with peaks of 14.4% in Germany, 15.2% in Japan and 21.5% in Mexico.


The decade 2010-2020 then subsequently experienced the aftermath of the global financial crisis, seeing the European debt crisis worsening (2009-2012), preceded by the collapse of entire national financial systems such as the Icelandic one and real defaults such as the Greek one, as well as register an unemployment rate of 10%.


#Between creative finance and expansive monetary policies


The new decade did not start in the best way for the planet, and not only from an economic-financial point of view. The advent of Covid-19 has forced governments to apply extreme measures to a total national lock-down in an attempt to contain the pandemic expansion. In March 2020, the markets responded to the Covid factor with a vertical decline very similar to that recorded eleven years earlier due to the financial crisis, but the important _Quantitative Easing_ measures implemented by the major global economic powers meant that the markets restarted quickly. and reached the highest peaks ever reached in the first quarter of 2021.


Despite the apparent recovery, some values ​​are altered and the impact of these alterations does not seem to have yet been quantified at a macro-economic level, although it is not known to date whether the problem has been faced behind closed doors in the halls of power. of the world economy and finance. All that remains is to ask questions and try to suggest answers pending further data, details and official confirmations.


Since the beginning of the pandemic, governments around the world have been preparing to launch aggressively expansionist policies to cauterize the wound suddenly opened by Covid-19; but at what price? Although journalistically and morally evaluated as a commendable effort, the constant stimulus packages directly paid by the States into the pockets of citizens, the transversal injections of capital that have made the entire economic-financial fabric more liquid (from private companies to credit institutions) and the relaxation of lending and repayment policies have exponentially increased the working capital, leading to fears of the advent of hyper-inflationary waves, as well as increasing the systemic risk in relation to credit exposure.


In reality, inflationary peaks have not occurred, especially in consideration of the fact that generally these are recorded in situations where there is a convergence of three factors:

* excess liquidity;
* full employment;
* high speed of circulation.

The pandemic has practically acted as a barrier to inflation, preventing the fulfilment of points 2 and 3 just listed. At the same time, the surge in stock markets after the collapse of March 2020 is to be considered financed more by these liquidity injections into the world economy than directly proportional to the growth of gross world product.


#The Bitcoin boom and the new digital asset economy


A good idea on the subject is provided by the surge in the prices of cryptocurrencies as an asset class, obviously headed by Bitcoin. A necessary digression is needed to give context. Ten years after its appearance, Bitcoin appears to be the asset with the best performance, that is, with the best economic return (ROI) in the world. To give an example, HowMuch.net (financial education site) calculated that 100 $ invested at the beginning of 2009 in today's best multinationals (such as Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook) would have produced the following results:

* Facebook 520 $ = + 420%
* Microsoft $ 1,000 = + 899%
* Apple 2.400 $ = + 2.345%
* Amazon $ 3,300 = + 3.156%

In the same period (January 2009 - December 2019), $ 100 invested in Bitcoin would have recorded the following growth:

* Bitcoin $ 9,200,000 = 9,150,088%

Obviously, the number is calculated on the values ​​of December 2019, when 1 Bitcoin was available for purchase for $ 7,500. Today, in April 2021, 1 Bitcoin is equivalent to approximately $ 57,500, a further + 750% compared to the above figure of $9.2M. Without wishing to go into the merits of the use-case of Bitcoin and the innovative concept of blockchain, the Bitcoin case serves the purpose of demonstrating how the surge in prices in the last twelve months or so is dictated by the excess of new printed currency.


Intrinsic features of Bitcoin are network security (non-hackability of the system), scarcity (there is a finite number of Bitcoins and once in circulation no more can be produced) and the democratized supply system. These characteristics, [read through the lens provided by ""Metcalfe's law""]([https://dcresearch.medium.com/metcalfes-law-and-bitcoin-s-value-2b99c7efd1fa](https://dcresearch.medium.com/metcalfes-law-and-bitcoin-s-value-2b99c7efd1fa) have allowed many economists and mathematicians to make really ambitious predictions for the price of Bitcoin in the future. Originally presented in 1980 by Robert Metcalfe to describe the impact of telephony in an exponentially proportional manner to the increase of telephones in society (_compatible communicating devices_, the theory was later refined by George Gilder in 1993 and applied to Ethernet. In its basic form, the law states that the value of the telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of users connected to the system (n²), where n equals the number of nodes.

https://www.futurimagazine.it/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sindaco1.jpg

To put it simply, the value of a network is proportional to the number of participants in the network squared. This law applies to the growth of Bitcoin to perfection, showing perfect correlation between the increase in the number of Bitcoin addresses (wallet addresses) and the increase in the price.

https://www.futurimagazine.it/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sindaco2-1024x633.jpg

This correlation has led to multiple projections and forecasts, the most famous of which is that of PlanB (where B stands for Bitcoin), a Dutch institutional investor with an academic background in quantitative law and finance, which through its Stock-To-Flow Model (S2F) elaborated and published in March 2019 had predicted a value of $ 55,000 for Bitcoin by 2021, or a market capitalization of $ 1 trillion (at the time of the forecast, Bitcoin was valued at $ 4,000 and in its ten-year history it had reached $ 20,000 per coin just once, at the peak of December 2017).


Bitcoin was designed by Satoshi Nakamoto in the famous white paper of October 31, 2008 and the first Bitcoin was mined on January 3, 2009 and its open source code was made accessible to the world on January 8, 2009; as described and envisaged in the white paper, Bitcoin not only has a predefined maximum quantity - Hard Cap - but is ""mined"" block by block, Proof-of-Work after Proof-of-Work (PoW), through mining (""extraction ""). Every 210,000 blocks - approximately every four years - the amount of ""mineable"" Bitcoin halves in a process known as halving.


The PlanB model tracks the past, present and future value of Bitcoin in correlation with increasing scarcity:

* Stock = is the quantity of existing product/currency/commodity (in this case of Bitcoin);
* Flow = is the annual production of the asset in question;

The following tab will serve as an example:

https://www.futurimagazine.it/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sindaco3.jpg

Gold records a stock-to-flow (SF) of 62, implying that it would take 62 years of production to reach the quantity of product existing today; for silver it takes 22 years and this makes both assets excellent reserves of monetary value.

In the following graph, the regression line drawn to better plot the entered data confirms the impression that one has with the naked eye: a statistically significant relationship between SF and market value (note that the model is based on production halving - _Halving_- as shown on the right and the value is calculated on a logarithmic scale as shown on the left - covering 8 orders of magnitude).

It turns out to be quite interesting that gold and silver, while being completely different markets, are in line with the values ​​of the Bitcoin model regarding the SF.

https://www.futurimagazine.it/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sindaco4.jpg

The then visionary forecast was then followed by another equally ""reckless"" one, which estimated the market capitalization of Bitcoin at around 5.5 trillion dollars, or $ 288,000 per coin before the advent of the next Halving (April 19, 2024).

https://www.futurimagazine.it/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sindaco5.jpg

To date, Bitcoin seems to follow PlanB's S2F Model to the letter.

https://www.futurimagazine.it/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sindaco6.jpg

In fact, the speed with which Bitcoin reached the value of $ 55,000 ($ 1 trillion Market Cap) was found to be excessive according to many analysts and led to the conclusion that the value of Bitcoin and the stock market in general are extremely inflated, this is precisely because of the recent capital injections by governments around the world.

According to a survey by Mizuho Securities on March 15, 40 billion dollars of the 380 ready to be injected into the American economy will be allocated for investments and two out of five people (40%) said they would prefer to bet on Bitcoin rather than invest in traditional assets.

#A new crisis on the horizon


The liquidity injection recorded in the last twelve months in the United States alone has seen the amount of dollars in circulation (2 trillion) increase by an incredible 40%, accelerating the devaluation of the currency. This devaluation may not be immediately recognizable in the real economy, as the lock-down measures have significantly slowed down the speed of circulation and the pandemic has generally aggravated the unemployment rate; but the symptoms are definitely noticeable in the financial market, with the peaks recorded by all the assets in circulation: commodities, cryptocurrencies, stocks, bonds.


How are these signs indicators of a possible dire future? The thesis we support is that of the overvaluation of all markets, deriving from the over-exposure of financial actors (_overleveraging_) a situation made possible by the policies of quantitative easing, injections of currency at zero interest by central banks (FED in primis) and the lowering of the level of credit risk (i.e. an easier access to credit for large financial institutions in order to “Pumping” liquidity into the economy across the board). These circumstances, added to the deregulation and non-regulation of the Shadow Banking sector, have attracted more and more financial players with a high propensity to risk, as their success is calculated purely quantitatively following the ""Two and Twenty"" law:


* 2% of the managed capital (_Asset Under Management_) is the commission received regardless of the results;
* 20% of profits is the commission received upon completion of a successful transaction.

This rule, juxtaposed with the very nature of Hedge Funds, ie their being ""resource aggregators"" (coming from the fund's investors / financiers) and mere ""managers"" of the latter, together with the lewd climate from a legislative and expansive point of view, as well as from a monetary point of view, they are triggering a credit overexposure mechanism that could risk a real _systemic failure_ if you do not act in time.

Hedge Funds are high risk / return vehicles of speculation and operate with short-term maneuvers in order to maximize the return; among the strategies most used by these funds is _levering_, debt-based investment and short-selling. The expansionism recorded in the last decade of monetary policies, the extreme _quantitative easing_ of the last twelve months to cope with the pandemic crisis, added to the zero interest rate policy by central banks, have created a liquidity tsunami that has led to a very risky relaxation of the credit sector. It should be noted that the institutional financial system is the de facto lung of a country's finance and economy. The zero interest decided by the hyper-expansionary monetary policies poured liquidity into the financial and credit sector starting from the credit institutions, then expanding like wildfire towards insurance institutions, pension funds, Hedge Funds and, due to the (_trickle- down effect_), flooded the financial market and the world stock exchanges.

The mechanism is quite elementary: credit institutions are incentivized to accumulate interest-free liquidity from central banks; the operators, or the bankers, earn commissions, that is a percentage of the money lent, therefore they are incentivized to give loans; and the greater flows of credit capital are required by investment funds, which in turn use the available capital to obtain deeper lines of credit and at the same time earn 2% of the assets managed (resulting in an extremely incentive to credit exposure) . Obviously, all these institutions use insurance institutions to protect their operations in the event of a default / bankruptcy of one of the creditors, and these institutions in turn tend to mitigate their default risk through debt collateralisation and Credit Default Swaps.

It goes without saying that as long as the market wind blows in the direction of the big investors, profits are calculated in billions of dollars and the system thrives; the problem begins to arise when the market becomes almost impracticable even for these subjects despite being highly specialized, equipped and financed.

#The GameStop case: Hedge Fund vs. Wall Street Bets

When at the end of January 2021 the GME title of the video game retail chain GameStop reached $ 483 in value on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the world did not notice and few knew the story behind the surge. the price; even today, very few know what is happening and it is our intention to shed light on one of the potentially most important events in the financial history of the last ten years and which could perhaps mark the future of the economy and finance by forcing the American legislator (and many others to follow) to change the rules of the game.

A dutiful preamble: the GameStop company has been living its third age for years and its business model based on stores and sales of consoles and video games is going in the same terminal direction as that of a giant of the past that has failed today: Blockbuster. GME stock has for years mirrored what Wall Street thought of its archaic business model: the tendency to bankruptcy. The value of the stock has performed in a range between 4-5 dollars for years with no movements whatsoever, almost waiting for the coup de grace. Even before the pandemic, many financial players (in particular Hedge Funds) took advantage of the weakness and corporate immobility to speculate on the failure and consequential de-listing of the stock from the stock exchange. This speculation took place in the form of short selling: this is a common practice in finance, which is equivalent to a bet ""against"" the performance of a company, or by making the investor gain the more the company is in bankruptcy.

In April 2020, when the panic generated by the lock-down measures hit the world stock exchanges, the stock collapsed to an all-time low to touch $ 2.60 and indirectly confirming to investors that they had aimed against the company's survival. that their assumptions were well founded, incentivizing them to double their shorting positions assuming that the lock-down would deliver the final coup de grace. Meanwhile, other investors around the world have assessed the company's future differently, in conjunction with the fact that the new consoles are still producing slots for reading CDs and DVDs and therefore total digitization seems to be still far away, as far as the horizon is concerned. Investors such as Michael Burry (CEO of Scion Asset Management and the first ever to predict the American real estate bubble) and Ryan Cohen (CEO and founder of Chewy, the world's leading e-commerce company in the sale of pet products) have read great potential in the company and certainly in the GME stock, considering it undervalued.

Their considerations throughout 2020 were then adopted by some small investors (retail investors) headed by the Youtuber ""RoaringKitty"", known on the Reddit platform under the pseudonym of u/ DeepF — ingValue, born Keith Patrick Gill. By the end of 2020, Cohen had bought 13% of the company's stock while the stock had risen from $ 2.60 to around $ 20. The situation was hot for many Hedge Funds, who found themselves overexposed in their shorting strategy against a stock that had seen its value multiply 7.7 times its lowest price (far from bankruptcy!). Meanwhile, the r/WallStreetBets subreddit, on which Gill continued to post his analyzes, comments and evidence of his investments, had adopted the title in a sort of protest against finance, like an Occupy Wall Street 2.0.

This protest, combined with genuine consideration of the potential of the GME stock and the GameStop company to transform with Cohen's entry into the board of directors, has resulted in a bulk purchase of the stock on every online trading platform accessible to the small investor. The stock jumped from $ 20 to $ 483 in just a few days, reducing some Hedge Funds almost to the streets, the most affected of which was undoubtedly Melvin Capital (to which the Citadel Securities fund with 2.75 billion dollars had to come to the rescue. and Point72 with 750 million bailouts). The surge triggered a sudden Short Squeeze, or the rush to buy back shares by those actors who had bet on the fall to contain the losses resulting from the surge; buyback that combined with the pressure of the surge itself tends to exacerbate the volume of purchases by inflating the value of the shares in question: the catalyst was the discovery by the ""people of Reddit"" that the shares subject to shorting were more than 100% of the number of existing official shares, implying that the shorters were applying the technique of Naked Short Selling (the practice of selling ""shares short"", or the sale of a security without having possession of it, not receiving it on loan or even making sure that this loan possibly possible) and ""producing"" ""synthetic"", ""derivative"" actions and placing oneself in the condition of being subject to squeeze.

In the following weeks, the stock fell in what initially appeared to be the deflation of the bubble, or the natural _post-squeeze_ regression of a stock towards its real market value (as happened in 2008 for Volkswagen stock). In fact, due to the non-regulation of Hedge Funds and the fact that short positions are not subject to quarterly disclosure to the SEC, the small investors who meet in droves daily on Reddit and discuss the topic have continued (and continue to date) to speculate and argue that the squeeze has not yet occurred and the fall in the share price is only the result of market manipulation. In January, the value of the stock was held back by the work of the actors most at risk, namely Hedge Funds and online trading platforms. During the hectic stages of the takeover, small investors were cut off from buying shares and found the purchase functionality blocked on their trading apps (the shares could only be sold). Platforms such as Robinhood have been accused of collusion with big funds by small investors who flooded Twitter, Reddit (r/WallStreetBets; r/Gamestop ; r/Superstonk) and the message boards of the same trading platforms with messages of revenge and threats of class action.


The chaos generated by the deflation of the stock, which reached $ 38.50 in February, combined with heavy accusations of collusion and financial manipulation, forced the American Congress to request a [hearing on the matter](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/17/business/gamestop-hearing.html?) in which all the actors in question were called to testify, including Youtuber “Roaring Kitty” Gill. Starting from the hearing, the stock has regained ground and between the end of February and the beginning of March it touched up the $ 350 in a tight growth without hint of a slowdown (a symptom that the squeeze is still in progress), so much so as to force operators on the other part of the market (the shorters) to use whatever means at their disposal to stop the price surge (_ladder attacks, naked short selling, married puts, synthetic longs, discardable deep in the money calls, dark pools_, etc. are all tactics existing that it is only possible to speculate have been implemented as they are of dubious legality and there is no certain evidence of their use). The stock's value plummeted again in late March to $ 120 and at the time of this analysis it is hovering between $ 140-160.

The question that arises spontaneously is whether and in what way this saga can be relevant for a broader macro-economic discourse. The stock has now stopped moving in parallel with the company and the extremely positive news that is perceived of an imminent transformation (starting with the appointment of the new board of directors). Today the stock seems at the mercy of far more powerful forces, even higher than the power of Hedge Funds who would like to see it collapse completely. The forces in question represent the real tip of the balance in an attempt to prevent the dreaded systemic failure. The work of these forces would also coincide with the most important and violent interference of the American legislator in the affairs of the free market while these are still in progress, with all due respect to the ""invisible hand"" of Adam Smith.

#Change of course or change of the rules of the game?

At the top of the American market sits an independent government agency completely disconnected from the traditional executive, acting under the aegis of special statutes and accountable for its work in Congress, which can request ad hoc hearings and appoints the top. The agency in question is the SEC, established in the 1930s following the Collapse of '29 and the subsequent Great Depression. The work of the SEC is supported at system level (not by statute) by the Depository Trust &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC), a private company that provides clearing and settlement services to the financial market, or which acts as an arbiter of all transactions financial statements so that these are respected and all the suspended ones are covered up to the point of establishing themselves as the ""ultimate guarantor"" in order to ensure compliance with each transaction. Established in 1999 with the function of integrating the work of the Depository Trust Company (DTC) and the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC), DTCC is now ranked among the top 500 companies in the world by Fortune magazine.

These entities have repeatedly found themselves embroiled in thorny litigation, receiving heavy accusations from small listed companies and legal offices for having constantly closed their eyes to the work of Hedge Funds in the field of _Naked Short Selling_. To the harsh criticism, the DTCC has always responded that the problem was not so extensive as to warrant regulation and, while the SEC acknowledges the existence of the problem, it has in turn always supported the DTCC in case of legal proceedings.

The GameStop case is changing the rules of the game en passant, or at least causing this change of course. Since the request for a hearing by Congress, the SEC and the DTCC have had multiple meetings behind closed doors to address the problem and find a solution that reduces the systemic risk of default. To date, the DTCC has produced important legislative changes to the procedures in place, with particular attention to the issues of _failure to deliver_ (FTD, i.e. the impossibility of repaying a debt, honouring a contract or returning a previously loaned security) and Naked Short Selling. As can be seen from the following graph on the [SEC website](https://sec.report/fails.php?tc=GME), the FTD against the GME stock is now standard and, as later documented by Bloomberg in a [spicy article on the subject](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-17/sec-data-show-359-million-of-gamestop-shares-failed-to-deliver), over 358 million dollars in shares in January 2021 were not returned resulting in FTD.

https://www.futurimagazine.it/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sindaco8.jpg

Clearly, [fines are foreseen if FTD is incurred](https://www.lawinsider.com/clause/penalty-for-failure-to-deliver-common-stock), but by now it seems that Hedge Funds prefer to incorporate the latter as a ""management cost"" to stay in business rather than worrying about acting according to the law and avoiding the infringement: the reward, obviously , is exponentially more attractive than any fine to be paid. To this distortion, the DTCC responded last March with a [plan]([https://www.finextra.com/pressarticle/86649/dtcc-proposes-three-point-plan-for-derivatives-trade-reporting-data-harmonisation) for the harmonization of data communication concerning derivatives and numerous [new rules](https://www.dtcc.com/legal/sec-rule-filings) are awaiting implementation that tighten the circle around the derivatives sector and the work of the most reckless. financial actors.

These new rules seem to demonstrate that the DTCC is clearly aware of the distortions initially considered ""irrelevant"" or ""little branched"" in the system; moreover, since DTCC is a private company, it knows very well that it is the ultimate guarantor of all financial transactions on the American market; ergo knows very well that in the event of a short squeeze and possible bankruptcy of large financial actors, a nefarious domino effect would be triggered which would lead to a series of insurance liquidations and margin calls (i.e. the forced liquidation of the entire investment portfolio of a debtor to ensure that the creditor can recover the capital lent totally or partially) as happened to the Lehman Brothers bank and to the AIG insurance company in 2008, which in the event of default would see the DTCC forced to stand as the last ""debtor"" towards the market (since precisely the ultimate guarantor).

#The Archegos case: has the domino effect already begun?

Awareness of the excessive systemic risk caused by the overexposure of large financial players is convincing the DTCC and SEC to work together to ensure that from a legislative point of view they are not ultimately footing the bill for what could be the largest party. expensive in the history of American and world finance. But time is running out.

The recent bankruptcy of the American fund Archegos Capital Management has exposed the risks of the investment banking and shadow banking sector. When Archegos found himself unable to respond to margin call requests from his creditors at the end of the first quarter, all he had to do was declare bankruptcy. Where does the international media apprehension about the affair derive from? From the fact that Archegos has recorded the largest loss by a single company or fund since the days of Lehman Brothers: 20 billion dollars in two days. [Operators such as Credit Suisse]([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-08/credit-suisse-tightens-hedge-fund-limits-amid-archegos-fallout](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-08/credit-suisse-tightens-hedge-fund-limits-amid-archegos-fallout) and Nomura, overexposed in the granting of loans to Archegos, had to record exorbitant losses at the end of the first quarter and suffered a further double blow with the loss of ground on the stock exchange of their respective stocks (11% and 14%) and with the loss of important capital by other large investors who preferred to migrate their liquidity to safer and less stormy shores (in the most classic of panic runs).

What is worrying is not only the colossal loss generated by the Archegos bankruptcy, the turmoil caused in the market by the forced sale of the shares held by Archegos and used as collateral payment to creditors, and the concatenating losses of investment banks such as Credit Suisse and Nomura; what worries further is that a fund sponsored by the major Wall Street and international brokers (GoldmanSachs, JPMorgan, Nomura and Credit Suisse) was almost non-existent in the SEC's EDGAR database (_Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval_), or the inherent data collection public disclosure of financial transactions. The DTCC and SEC are hard at work trying to change the rules of the game in an attempt to protect the system (and themselves) from the excessive risks that the Archegos case has laid bare.

#Conclusions: The Game Stops?

On the one hand we have the frenzied race against time of the institutions to change the legislative fabric so that the system is more protected and can better absorb bankruptcies of the size of the Archegos fund should they unexpectedly reappear (and given the low propensity to disclose information, it is expected that such bankruptcies continue to occur ""without notice""); on the other hand we have the GameStop case which shows no signs of deflating and still seems to be positioned for a [_violent Short Squeeze_]([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/we-should-see-the-gme-short-squeeze-continuing-s-3-partners-174542296.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/we-should-see-the-gme-short-squeeze-continuing-s-3-partners-174542296.html) (the Melvin Capital fund declared losses equal to 49% of its capital at the end of the first quarter).

The next two months will be among the hottest ever for the stock, all investors (on both sides of the market) and supervisory agencies. What is most worrying at the moment is the possible result of an uncontrolled squeeze, a scenario that we hope the institutions are considering in order to create a legislative structure around it that can support the pressure and defuse the risk of a systemic crisis. It goes without saying that the investors who back GameStop and aim for the squeeze (because they are fans of the company, because they are mere speculators, or because of a desire for revenge against Wall Street) are looking forward to seeing the stock fly on the stock market and see it fail and declare bankruptcy. Hedge Funds that bet against them. However romantic the happy ending of David defeating the financial Goliath of our times is, it is important to understand the repercussions of a possible fall of these funds on the global financial fabric and how to organize the chessboard so that the system comes out unscathed whatever it is. the outcome of the dispute.

What DTCC and SEC are trying to understand is how to stem a 2008 crisis-style domino effect, where a hedge fund's margin call could result not only in its bankruptcy but in an excessive loss of capital for its creditors as well (banks of investment) and the insurance institutions that act as guarantors of the operations. And given the risk balancing practice that sees banks exchanging Credit Default Swaps and insurance companies do the same, these ""protective"" practices against a possible collapse of one of the parties would act as a true link and common thread that could trigger the downfall of all. the domino pieces. More margin calls, more bankruptcies of funds, credit institutions and insurance companies would trigger a financial crisis greater in size than those of the subprime (2008), the Nasdaq(2000) and the Great Depression (1929) with the financial panic that would ensue, branching off in a widespread manner and seriously affecting all sectors of the economy, including households and savings. We would see the fastest collapse in the history of financial indices given the large number of existing online trading platforms; assets considered as a store of value such as gold, silver, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies would generally experience unprecedented exponential growth (also placing these markets at bubble risk, but that's another topic). The short squeeze of GME stock could be the catalyst of the crisis and DTCC and SEC are extremely aware of the situation.

Creating a legislative structure around the squeeze is the only conceivable solution at the moment, considering that the company's official shares are about 70 million and that the total number in the market is much higher (although not officially quantifiable) in the form of synthetic shares (final product of the practice of Naked Short Selling), making the squeeze difficult to avoid. And time is running out, as GameStop has announced its annual shareholders' meeting for June 9th and the recount of the shares will start from the sixtieth day before the meeting, and the feeling is that starting from this date there will be a sort of curfew and all overdrafts must be covered and the shares re-entered for the counting officer.

Archegos served as an alarm bell for the system to wake up and act to protect itself; GameStop is adding momentum for this to happen quickly. As outside observers, we are confident that the agencies involved will be able to untie the Gordian knot and ensure the security of the system. Our conviction derives from the awareness that these agencies are extremely resilient and when their very survival is put at risk they pull out their claws and there is no outside interest that cares: only their survival counts; luckily, their survival to date is directly linked to ours and that of the global financial system.

Seeing lots of chatter about Aladdin. Do you want me to write a full DD on it?,"I've been working on the hurst exponent stuff in my free time, but I can change gears to focus on blackrock and the aladdin portfolio management software.

From what i know off the dome, Aladdin is an acronym:

Asset

Liability

And

Debt

Derivative

Investment

Network

&#x200B;

What does aladdin do:

Aladdin is a software that runs a statistical model called a Monte Carlo simulation (named after the casino...)

Taken directly from wiki ""Monte Carlo methods are mainly used in three problem classes:[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method#cite_note-1) [optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization), [numerical integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_integration), and generating draws from a [probability distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution).""

The algorithm works to identify trends in the market (hurst exponent), and then trade ahead of those trends. This is done by randomly analyzing data points and some complex math. One of the core functions of the software it so identify RISK.

Everyone that has access to Aladdin knows what the hell is going on with GameStop.

&#x200B;

So, more DD?  Do some of you want to see the math that is behind the model?   Engineers around here should be able to digest most of the math, but I bet it will get pretty heavy into some probability distribution Markov style shit.

thoughts?

I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,"What's up everyone. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

[I just found out why my boyfriend never holds my toddler niece](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18tjfzh/i_just_found_out_why_my_boyfriend_never_holds_my/)**, Posted December 29th, 2023.**

Sorry, this is gonna be a long one.

I (27F) have been with my boyfriend (28M, Jay) for 5 years.

We’ve both been very close with each other’s families, and we’ve even talked about marriage. However, one touchy subject is children. Whenever we discuss it, he gets kinda stand-offish. He doesn’t really dismiss the idea though, it’s just that he doesn’t seem invested. I’ve always wanted kids, and he just always says he’s fine with whatever makes me happy. Ever since, I’ve been content with this situation.

However, things escalated during this holiday season.

Our setup has always been that Jay spends Christmas Eve and dinner with my family, then I spend Christmas Day with his family. This was the first Christmas I’ll spend with my first and only niece (2F, Ana, she spent her first Christmas in the hospital due to her health condition, but she’s okay now), so I made sure to spend a lot of time with her. We played a lot, we opened gifts together, and I even reenacted Ana’s favorite storybook using her favorite doll. We even had matching outfits!

My sister (30F, Amy) thanked me for giving her and her husband some relief from childcare the entire day. However, Amy also said she noticed that Jay, who was just either sitting on the couch watching me or helping my mom with the dishes, was kinda distant with Ana. I told her I’ve also noticed that before, and I just chalked it up to maybe Jay was hesitant and awkward to play with Ana because he feels he’s “just my boyfriend.” Then Amy said she won’t mind, since she and her husband already treat Jay as part of our family.

I then went back to Jay and encouraged him to play with Ana and help us set up her new dollhouse, but he said he’s not feeling too well. He ended up drinking a few more beers and stayed on the porch by himself, scrolling on his phone. I didn’t press harder and thought he might really just be feeling under the weather. I just want to add for context that Jay isn’t an alcoholic. He’s a sweet, wonderful, funny man who’s sometimes broody and deep in thought, but he’s never abusive, manipulative, or moody, and he only drinks on special occasions.

The next day, on Christmas Day, we had lunch with Jay’s family. Afterward, I volunteered for cleanup to help Jay’s mom (62F, Mary) and brother (31M, John). Jay’s family was the best any significant other could ever ask for. They’re very sweet and supportive of us, but they’re never prying. They always check up on us, but they never overstep. So, as we were cleaning up, Mary asked me how my sister’s baby was (they helped with the bills when Ana was hospitalized last year). I told them that Ana’s in great condition now, and that she already spent the Christmas at home. They were very delighted upon hearing this.

Then, I shared with them the thing I noticed about Jay. Initially, I thought maybe Mary could just give me advice on how to approach the issue with Jay since he’s clearly not the playing-with-kids kind of guy, but then John casually said something like “Oh, because of Rosie,” then Mary quickly shushed him. Rosie was the daughter of Jay and John’s eldest sister, Beth (35F). I never knew the actual details because everyone was very secretive about it, but all I knew was that Rosie passed away when she was just 3 years old and Beth and her husband moved away afterward. I never met them in person.

So, later that night, when Mary, John, and the other family members got a bit more drunk and Jay was already sleeping in the bedroom, they told me the story (I didn’t force them or anything). Apparently, Jay, being the youngest of the siblings, was really close with Rosie back then. Jay was just around 14 years old when Rosie was born, so he became the super fun uncle (like I am now with Ana). He was actually Rosie’s best friend. Then, on summer of 2012, Jay was playing with Rosie outside (he was blowing bubbles and she was chasing and popping them) when a speeding car, driven by a woman who was distracted on her phone, skidded into the yard toward Rosie’s direction. Jay reacted quickly and was able to reach and grab Rosie so the car actually hit him, but the impact of the crash caused Rosie’s head to whiplash as Jay hugged her. Jay was in a coma for 3 days and had multiple severe injuries and internal bleeding, but Rosie didn’t make it.

Everything was caught by the neighbor’s CCTV so everyone knew that Jay was a hero for trying to protect Rosie (it was even covered by the local news), but Beth, who was understandably in grief, resented Jay for not being able to save her daughter. Beth and her husband then decided to move to another country to cope with their grief and start a new life, and they’ve had minimal contact with the family ever since. Jay, meanwhile, took the loss really hard. He blamed himself for not being able to save Rosie and not being able to attend her funeral since he was still at the hospital at that time. Mary said that Jay was never the same after that. He never went near kids, and he became a lot colder, quieter, more reserved, and antisocial. He also had anger issues, but it thankfully went away (I haven't had any issues with this). We also live in an area where people don’t believe in therapy, so Jay never received professional help.

After learning all of this, I bawled my eyes out because I never knew Jay was carrying such a heavy burden. The whole incident became a taboo family secret that no one mentions in fear of Jay breaking down or doing something he might regret (although to be fair, he’s never had violent or self-harm tendencies ever since, so this was just a precaution). They also never told me before because they assumed Jay would be the one to tell me, but I told them that he never did, and that I never really asked him. I then thanked everyone for letting me in on this, and I told them that I’d talk to Jay about it when the time is right. They understood, and they said I could just ring them up if I need help or support in any way. For now, I just want Jay to enjoy the holidays and his remaining vacation days from work.

Now, I don’t really know how to start with him. I know seeking professional help to process all the trauma and grief, even if it’s been over a decade ago, would be the top priority, but I don’t know how to bring it up to him. I don’t even know when is the right time to bring it up. I just want him to know that I love him no matter what, and that I’ll support him in every step toward his healing, especially if we’re to form a family of our own.

**Relevant Comments:**

*Jay is amazing, what a shame his sister blamed him, but I guess that’s what grief does to you.*

*I hope he gets the therapy he needs*

> From what I gathered from Jay's family, Beth never really voiced out that she blamed Jay for Rosie's passing. However, she became cold toward him to the point of almost ignoring him during family gatherings before they moved. Of course, everyone knew what it was all about.

*Maybe you guys can start couples counseling?*

*Jay has been living with his guilt, sadness, and anger for SO long. He might not be receptive to individual therapy. But maybe if you go together…it can open the door to healing and communication. Maybe with your love and support in couples consulting it will propel him further.*

*But the last part of your post is all you can do OP. Show Jay how much you love him and how much you crave to listen to all that he has to share. Be his safe space, his partner. ✨🥹💗*



*I will join this opinion with huge approval. Even though you really love Jay, it's most likely he will have a hard time opening up about it, and even if he says he's okay, do you know if he ever saw any therapist? This is the kind of thing that I feel would give PTSD to anyone.*

*Also, remember that he does not know that you know and might take badly the fact that the family revealed it to you, so make sure to remind him not to get mad at them, that it was a slip of the tongue and they had to explain. He seems like a wonderful person, but as you said yourself, grief can make you irrationnal sometimes, and it definitely doesn't look like he processed it all.*

*In any case, he is a wonderful man, and I'm glad he found a partner that is attentive and empathetic. You two take good care of each other, have a wonderful new year and lots of love. You deserve it.*

> I'm currently leaning toward waiting for him to bring it up himself, but of course I hope that it happens kinda soon so the grief and trauma don't consume him more than they already have.

> Thank you for your kind words!

*Holy crap I think we were all thinking that he had the worst intentions in the beginning. But that couldn’t be more wrong. This man was a hero and unfortunately his family has turned it into a dirty secret. I feel for you both so much. I don’t really have any advice. I just want you to know that you are both incredible people and I hope your love finds a way and you’re able to raise a beautiful family together, if you choose.*

> It's really sad how the family handled it, but I can't really blame them because I grew up in the same area. We live in a provincial, non-progressive city, and their family even lives in a more rural community where everyone knows everyone. If there's any ""scandal"" that potentially tarnishes the family name, it's swept under the rug.

> I guess the ""heroic"" part of the story is something the family could have been proud of, but the trauma, anger issues, lashing out, and antisocial behavior that Jay developed, as well as how Beth left the community afterward outweighed everything, so the entire thing just became the family's dirty secret.

*Sadly, that anger never went away; it's sadness now. Be understanding, and make sure your family understands as well.*

> Yeah, I'm trying to figure out a way to tell my family to be more sensitive about the subject around Jay without outright telling them the story because it's not mine to tell.

> Thank you!

*(This comment was downvoted) Is it just me or do I feel like Beth is a total piece of shit for how she treated Jay?*

  
*It’s easy to say that as an outsider. Grief really REALLY fucks with someone’s thought process.*

*I don’t blame anyone in this situation, Beth probably was looking for someone else to blame for her daughters death.*

> Yeah, the only person I blame is the distracted driver. I don't normally curse, but fuck her. She didn't just kill a baby, she destroyed a loving family. From all his family's stories, Jay seemed to be a very upbeat, warm, and sociable guy before the incident.

> I don't really blame Beth for how she reacted and processed her grief. As I mentioned in another comment, she never outright blamed Jay, but the family assumed she did for how she treated him afterward (again, we don't live in a very progressive area). She lost her daughter, and she was also young back then (she was just around 24) when it happened. Even if I never knew her, I wish Beth nothing but peace and healing throughout all this.

*She died as he was hugging her, I. Can't imagine the grief he went through.*

> That's also something bothering me a lot. Of course, I'm just assuming here, but knowing how much of an overthinker Jay is who hyperfixates on what ifs, I know he has replayed that moment in his head a million times, overanalyzing every little detail.

> One of the worst things he could possibly be thinking is that maybe he was the one who killed Rosie, because it was the whiplash and not the actual crash that impacted her the most. It's bad enough that he lost his niece and best friend, but for her to die in his arms and thinking that it was him who might've accidentally killed her instead of saving her is absolutely horrible.

> That's the ""what if"" I fear he's thinking the most. And just to be clear, no one actually blames him.

*Why are they so hard pressed on forcing him to interact with a child more than he wants to? Instead of letting him get comfortable in his own time, you're all forcing him to do it right now. I'm very uncomfortable with children but given time I'll come around, I just need to get over the anxiety and panic about hurting them by accident. If somebody and their family were this insistent I'd just be more uncomfortable.*

> I don't think anyone is really forcing him though. In the 2 years we've welcomed Ana into this world, no one has forced Jay to interact with her just for the sake of it. I've been interacting with Ana every time our family gets together, and Jay has been distant but fine overall, and we just let him be because it was never an issue. We all just accepted that he wasn't comfortable around kids. Also, when I was encouraging him to interact more during Christmas Eve, it was more along the lines of ""Hey, you know you're welcome to help us with this dollhouse, you know? I know you're judging my lack of craftsmanship here lol""

> Amy's intention of bringing this to my attention is just to make Jay feel more welcome in our family. Again, it was me who assumed that maybe Jay was just awkward with Ana because he might've felt like an outsider and he didn't want to overstep. My entire conversation with Amy was rooted more in including Jay in our family and making him feel comfortable enough.

> However, given everything I've learned, I'll make sure that everyone is more sensitive with this subject around him.

[UPDATE I just found out why my boyfriend never holds my toddler niece](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1c80gmj/update_i_just_found_out_why_my_boyfriend_never/)**, Posted April 20th, 2024.**

Hi, it’s been a while since my first post. I have some major updates for anyone interested. You may check my profile for my previous post.

Also, I took some time to organize my thoughts first to make sure I don't miss anything pertinent. It's kinda long as a lot have happened since, so I've divided this into sections to make it easier to follow.

QUICK RECAP

My boyfriend (Jay) and I have been together for 5 years. Throughout our relationship, I noticed that he's always distant with kids, including my niece, Ana. During Christmas, Jay's family revealed that it was because of an incident over a decade ago. Turns out, Jay was really close with his toddler niece, Rosie. One day, when they were playing outside, they were hit by a distracted driver. Jay tried to save Rosie. He sustained severe injuries, but Rosie still didn't make it. Beth (Rosie's mom and Jay's sister) acted cold toward Jay after this, then she and her husband moved to another country after a few months. From then on, Jay's personality changed, becoming cold and antisocial, and he never received professional help. All of this has become Jay's family's ""dirty"" secret.

PART 1: THE CONFESSION

Since learning about Rosie and posting here on Reddit, I’ve been so conflicted about what to do. A lot of you had opposing opinions, and all of them had merit, but knowing Jay and how he’d most likely react, I chose to keep it a secret until I find the perfect time.

What I didn’t anticipate was that the perfect time would come in the form of a pregnancy scare. Back in January, I had a false positive. Everything happened so quickly within a day. I had a rollercoaster of emotions, but bottom line was that I’m not pregnant after all. When Jay got back home that night, I knew I had to tell him everything. I told him I had a pregnancy scare, but he has nothing to worry about since it ended up being negative. At that moment, I saw all the blood drain from his face, and he became so pale that I was worried he was going to faint. I was holding his hand, and he became so sweaty and cold and shaky. He rushed to our refrigerator to get some water, and it was obvious he was spiraling really hard. That was when I told him I knew about Rosie.

I came clean because I knew that was what he was panicking about. I assured him that I’m by his side, and he could react however he wanted to. I repeatedly apologized for disrespecting his trust and lying to him for weeks. I also asked him to please not be mad at his family because they meant well when they told me. Throughout all of it, I couldn’t really read Jay’s expressions. I wasn’t sure if he was about to scream out of anger or burst into tears. I told him that we don’t have to talk about it any further if he doesn’t want to, but I’d be willing to listen and support him whenever he’s ready.

His only response that time was him asking me if I wanted to break up with him, which confused me. I told him of course not, then we hugged, then he said he needs some time to process everything before we discuss it, which I respected. For the rest of the week, we tried to interact like nothing happened, but everything was awkward since there’s this huge thing hanging between us.

PART 2: THE TALK

The following weekend (which was 8 days after), we finally sat down and talked about everything. He started by apologizing for not telling me sooner, but he revealed that his last girlfriend dumped him after he told her about Rosie. He said he was so relieved after I reassured him that I wouldn’t do that. He then told me that it was something that’s been weighing him ever since, and he’s confirmed that he never sought or received professional help. However, he said he’s very much open to doing that, but he didn’t think he’s ready yet. He also said he’s afraid to go down that path because it might release some inner demons and drag me down with him.

Another thing Jay told me was that ever since Rosie was born, he felt an instant and deep connection and a sense of responsibility for her, even when he was just a teenager that time. He said that having Rosie in his life made him realize how much he wanted to be a father when he's older. However, since the incident, he’s afraid of messing things up again, so he never really considered having kids from then on despite really wanting to do so. I then reassured him that we’re on the same page on this. Although I also want to have kids with him in the future, I don’t want to force it on him when he’s not yet ready.

He also said that whenever he sees me with Ana (my niece), he gets kinda jealous because he wants to join us every time. However, he constantly reminds himself to keep his distance just to be safe. I told him he doesn’t have to worry about that, and that he’s more than welcome to join us if he wants to. I also told him that my sister and the rest of my family actually considers him a part of our family, just to reassure him more.

Jay tried to lighten the mood by joking and saying now that I know everything about him and still didn’t break up with him, I could finally expect a proposal anytime soon. We both had a good laugh, but we agreed to wait for his recovery first before getting engaged or discussing our future family.

PART 3: BETH

During our discussion, Jay also had another heartbreaking revelation. He said that during the height of the pandemic, Beth’s husband (Brian) reached out to him. Brian said that Beth had COVID and was confined in a hospital, and that he was already running low on funds due to bills and unemployment. He also said that Beth had been almost catatonic since Rosie’s passing. She had been resistant to any outside and professional help, but she was institutionalized for about a year after a self-harming incident. For the past decade, she’d been cold, distant, and withdrawn from society.

Apparently, the rest of Jay’s family also knew about all this, but again, they just swept it under the rug. To be fair, they had been helping Brian by sending financial aid to support Beth, but their version of the story was that Beth had just gone low contact since they moved.

Also, to be very clear, Jay said that Beth never blamed him for what happened to Rosie, although he initially felt that way when he was younger. It was more of their parents interpreting and spinning things a certain way to avoid tarnishing their family’s reputation, but when Brian reached out to him directly years ago, he started to understand better. However, he still hasn’t processed everything, and he still partly blames himself for the whole thing.

PART 4: OUR CURRENT SITUATION

For now, what we’re exploring is couple’s therapy so we can discuss our mutual issues in a safe and pressure-free space, and hopefully, kind of ease him into the world of therapy. We’ve already found the perfect therapist to help us, and we’ve now had 6 sessions with her. From what I can tell, Jay seems a lot happier and less burdened. We’ve also had “homeworks” from our sessions, and Jay was even the one reminding me to do them.

Right now, I’m just hoping that he becomes ready enough to open up about Rosie so he can heal and recover from his trauma. Not for me, but for his mental and emotional well-being. No rush though, all in his own time.

Also, Jay has no social media, but I showed him the original Reddit post I made. He spent like three hours reading through all the comments. It was the first time I saw him get teary-eyed because he never expected so many people giving him support and saying kind words to him. He was extremely overwhelmed by everyone’s kindness, so we’re both grateful to all of you for that. We also saw some TikTok and YouTube versions of the story, and you bet Jay browsed through all of them. He’s still baffled why the TikTok versions have Minecraft or cooking videos in the background, but I just told him it’s a trend haha

So, there, if you've made it this far into our story, thank you for your time! I have a good feeling that Jay and I are going to be fine. We still have a lot of challenges ahead of us, but here's to hoping for the best!

EDIT: So Jay and I now kinda share this account. He might reply directly from time to time (this is his first time on Reddit, so please be kind to him. I had to explain to him what OP and a lot of the other lingo mean haha). Yeah, but we're both reading everything! Again, thank you for being so kind!

**Relevant Comments:**

*I hope Jay continues healing, and eventually Beth somehow gets out of the mental hole she’s in. Both them went through something horrible that no one who hasn’t been in that situation can comprehend. Thoughts for both of them*

> Thank you for your kind words. As for Jay, I can see that he's already making some progress, even though it's more like baby steps. Nonetheless, it is still progress. As for Beth, I can't even begin to imagine what she's going through. I just pray that she finally finds some peace eventually.

*I'm so happy with this update, that now Jay knows that you're on his side and is getting professional help. What happened to Rose was a tragedy and wasnt his fault at all. My heart hurts to think of the weight he must be carrying for all this time.*

*Wishing you two all the best!*

> Yeah, he's starting to open up more about his internal struggles and burdens, but he hasn't touched on the subject of Rosie yet. The least I can do for him is to let him know I'm here for him.

> Thank you for your kind words!

***Deleted Comment.***

> I won't make excuses for them. On a human, personal level, they are extremely lovely, generous, and kind people. They have welcomed me as a part of their family, and they even extended help when my sister's daughter, Ana, had congenital health problems. I have met different relatives of my exes before, and in comparison, Jay's family has been the most wonderful and welcoming.

> However, I would say that they are a product of the very traditional, nonprogressive area in which we live. We are a Catholic community, and most activities revolve around our parish. Reputation is everything, yet town gossip is still very rampant. I understand that this may sound backward-thinking in our modern times, but that is the reality of our lives (I also grew up in the same area, so I fully understand their behavior).

> Although I agree with you that everything that happened and how they reacted to it had been unfortunate to say the least, and Jay and Beth got the brunt of it.

*Im so sorry for asking but im really baffled here.*

*Jay was a victim as well. He was in the accident. So what kind of reputation was to be saved? And why did they let Jay feel like it was his fault? What town gossip can possibly be there from this awful accident?*

*I cant wrap my head around this. I truly hope Jay can find his much deserved peace, especially Beth & Bryan. And you, you are an angel!*

> I'm honestly just as confused as well.

> I don't think the intention was to make Jay feel he was at fault. I think the intention was to just not talk about it at all and make it seem like it never happened. Like a family secret never to be brought up so the bomb doesn't go off or something.

> Being rational definitely wasn't a priority, and unfortunately, it was Jay and Beth who suffered.

*You're being an amazing partner to him, im happy he has you 🥺❤️*

> yeah she's pretty wonderful. lucky to have her in my life. -jay

*Please tell me that woman who was driving is STILL in jail.*

*Thats the update i want so bad. Justice. Everyone out here suffering - wanna make sure she didnt just grt community service / slaps on wrist*

> She did 1 year jail time, 5 years probation (not sure how much was really served)

*Is his sister physically ok now, after COVID?*

*I really hope they both are able to get the help they need, they deserve the peace and I’m pretty sure that the little girl wouldn’t have wanted her uncle and her mommy to live in so much pain and suffer. I truly wish both of them the best.*

*And to Jay personally; Laugh for her. Play with Ana, teach her stuff, have fun, enjoy life and don’t be so hard on yourself. If this would have happened to some strangers and you’d read it in the newspaper, would you blame the boy who tried everything he could to save this little girl? From what I can read in this post, but especially between the lines, you’ll be a great dad one day. Will you be able to always protect them, to never let them get hurt, to always be there, ..? No. But you will do your best. You’ll do everything you can. You’ll love this/those beautiful human being/s with every fibre of your being. This is everything you have to do. Love them. You can’t have the control over them or the things that can happen, and this is not your fault. You’re only human. And you deserve to have the life you always dreamed of, to feel free and to be yourself. Your true self.*

*And as someone who suffers under complex PTSD: You think once you open this box, everything will rush all over you. It will consume you, you’ll lose the little control you have, you’ll get sucked in and everyone and everything around you too, your world will go down and you’re not strong enough yet to keep it together. - That won’t happen. It’s hard work and it hurts like hell. Yes. But your brain will give everything to protect you. Piece by piece. There’ll be days where you feel like you’ll never see the light, but there will be also days you’ll feel so free and loose, at peace with yourself, that things lift and you’re able to breathe again. And you’re not alone. And you won’t pull your woman down with you. Don’t forget that she wants to be there, that she loves you and she wants to carry this bag with you. And it’s much easier to carry weight when you do it together. As a team. You’re stronger than you think. Take a look in the mirror. Look into your eyes and take a moment to truly realize that you’re still here. You’re alive. You found a woman who truly loves you, a family you can build on, a future ahead of you. You’re still here.*

> Beth has recovered from COVID, so she's physically fine now. However, she's still mentally detached and has gone back to her almost catatonic state. Jay suggested couples therapy to Beth's husband after experiencing it firsthand, but we don't have an update on it yet.

> Also, thank you so much for your insights. You said a lot of sensible things that we never knew (both Jay and I were clueless about therapy and psychology in general), so we actually learned new things from what you said. Jay says he appreciates you and is extremely grateful, and so am I!

*Happy for you both and sending energy your way for the growth and healing you need. I would think individual counseling would be a good option for you guys as well just because with trauma like this it can be very helpful. My heart goes out to Jay and am so happy you two found eachother.*

> Yeah, that's the plan. Once Jay becomes more comfortable with therapy and feels ready enough to do it on his own, he'll have individual counseling so he can focus on his healing. I'll be right here supporting him in every step. Thank you!

*I have a rule that I won’t hold a baby unless it has been at least 48 hours since I dropped anything. It’s pretty rare that I succeed*

> maybe that should be my rule too -jay

*Jay, I think it’ll help you to start playing in the house with Ana with OP right there. Try it for a few minutes. If you feel overwhelmed, you can also step away. OP can take over. It’ll help you to desensitize. Try it again later on and see if you can increase the duration, even if it’s just for an extra minute.*

*When my niece was a toddler, she loved playing with me. She’d be on the floor and I’d be sitting with her or on the couch. She’d spend hours with her play phone, telling me that the monsters were over here and then she’d hand me the receiver of her play phone, telling me to call the police. So then I’d pretend to call the police. This would go on for hours. Literally hours. LOL! But it’s a wonderful memory.*

*As for holding babies, you can try that step when you’re feeling more confident. When I’m holding a baby, especially for the first time, I’m sitting on the couch. It makes me feel more secure. And with this, again, you can try it for a few minutes. If it feels like too much, you can hand the baby back to the parents.*

*It’s all about taking baby steps. You’ll get there.*

> Hi, thank you for your suggestion. We've also discussed this already. However, Jay still doesn't feel like he's ready for such a step, however minor it may be. When I brought up the idea of him maybe joining us whenever I play with Ana, he had such a huge smile on his face, but then he started sweating and hyperventilating. For now, we'll settle for a more hands-off but still thoughtful approach by preparing a gift for Ana's 3rd birthday (she's in her mermaid phase, so Jay's designing a mermaid tail that we'll both create as best we could haha).

> We still have a long way to go, but I'm hoping we'll eventually get there.

[My friends tell me (28F) that I’m in a toxic relationship with my bf (28M), but I don’t think I am. What do I do?](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1f2l28t/my_friends_tell_me_28f_that_im_in_a_toxic/)**, Posted August 28th, 2024.**

Sorry, this is going to be a bit of a long one. TLDR at the end.

I (28F) have been in a relationship with my boyfriend Jay (28M) for 6 years.

Last Christmas, I made a huge discovery about Jay’s life. Long story short, his 3-year-old niece died in his arms when he was just 17 years old. They were extremely close, and they were playing in their yard when a car hit them. He tried to save her, but he eventually couldn’t. He blamed himself for it, and his family covered everything up. Jay never received any support or professional help. Also, his sister (his niece’s mom) had become catatonic following the incident, and she moved to another country with her husband. Everything resulted in Jay being uncomfortable about the topic of kids, even though he actually wanted to have his own, due to his unresolved issues.

Fast forward to January. I found out that I had an early miscarriage that led to a false positive pregnancy test. I was lucky that I had my sister with me throughout the day when all this happened, but then when I came home, of course I had to tell Jay. He then spiraled and had a full-on panic attack, but this eventually led to us confronting his trauma and us getting therapy.

We’ve been in couples therapy since late February. Everything was going smoothly, and our goal was to slowly ease Jay into therapy, then when he feels ready, he’d have individual sessions to address his issues surrounding his niece’s passing. That started last June. We’ve been having a couples therapy session once a month, then he’d have individual sessions 3x or 4x a month. There were times he even had to go 2x a week. I won’t go into too much detail anymore, but it has been extremely difficult for us. I can only imagine how painful and difficult it is for him.

I’d like to preface this by saying that ever since I met Jay, he had been extremely kind, sweet, gentle, and caring. I’ve never heard him curse, and he’s always the peacemaker when we chance upon conflicts or commotions (in restaurants, stores, etc.). He’s usually reserved and brooding, but he also jokes around a lot. We have a running joke of out-punning each other in the grocery store for various products and brands we see. He’s also never raised his voice. If he’s mad or annoyed at me, he just gets quiet and sleeps it off, then we’d discuss it in a civil manner the next day. I’ve never seen him actually get angry at me or anything for that matter.

However, when he started with his individual therapy sessions, I noticed that he started getting more irritable, neurotic, and easily triggered by a lot of small things that never bothered him before. He’s also been cooking less and less (he says that cooking has always been his happy place before), and we’ve been ordering in a lot more. I can feel him almost always being restless, like there are always a million things going through his mind and he wants to say something, but somehow couldn’t? There were also times when he wakes up at night and just sits by our window staring at nothing, like he’s in deep thought or something. I tried to talk to him once during those times, but it was as if he couldn’t hear me.

Also, he’s been less endearing toward me. Like, he’s not cold or harsh or anything. It’s just…he doesn’t seem to be as sweet as before? In our past 5 anniversaries, he had these elaborate plans that always led to an extremely sweet and memorable experience (a romantic dinner at a celebrity restaurant, a video greeting from all my friends and family, a concert of our favorite band, a musical show that I love, and a meet and greet with my favorite author). This year though, he totally forgot our anniversary. He then tried to make up for it by buying me a nice dress, which isn’t even the correct size.

Last week, Jay and I were invited to a housewarming party of one of my best friends. The two of us were originally supposed to attend, but he suddenly didn’t feel well, so he just dropped me off and went home. There, my best friends had some sort of intervention for me. They said that they’re all worried about me because they’ve been noticing how Jay has been treating me lately. They said that he’s been somewhat neglectful of me, and that he doesn’t treat me like how I deserve. They notice that he’s been leaving me alone a lot, flaking out on a lot of gatherings, and had been generally distant toward me and everyone else. They were even concerned if Jay had been abusive toward me, which I categorically denied since he had never ever harmed me.

Lastly, my friends said that Jay had not been providing me with the emotional support I need. The past months, I had been venting out to them about various things, including my job, some family problems, and my miscarriage. They said Jay should’ve been the first person I share these things with, but I just told them that I couldn’t. Of course, I couldn’t tell them about Jay’s trauma and everything else going on in his personal life. They even theorized that maybe Jay is cheating on me, which I can confidently refute. They then advised me to break up with him if he doesn't shape up and treat me right because they said that I deserve better.

Right now, I just don’t know what to do. I love and respect Jay a lot, and I know that his personality change is caused by his trauma and therapy. Our therapist warned us that this might happen because of the severity of his trauma, so I was somewhat prepared and I still know that he’s still the Jay I love and care for. However, I had no idea that to outsiders, our relationship already looked and felt toxic. I made a commitment to Jay that I’ll be with him throughout his recovery process, and I fully believe he’ll get through this, however long it takes.

Despite everything, I still love him. I just…I don’t know how to reach and connect with him now. Maybe I should also go into individual therapy myself? I don’t know, it’s now kinda out of our budget and his trauma seems higher priority than what I’m going through right now. Maybe I should just wait it out? Or maybe I should listen to my friends and consider taking a break from our relationship? I really don’t want to do that because Jay needs my support, but is it the right move for me?

TLDR: My boyfriend is undergoing therapy to resolve severe trauma over 10 years ago. This has caused some personality changes in him, which my friends thought made our relationship toxic. However, knowing the full context of his issues, I couldn't bring myself to break up with him (as advised by my friends). What do I do?

EDIT: Additional context that Jay and I were not planning on having a baby when I had the miscarriage. The pregnancy was unexpected (I didn't even know I was pregnant), and the miscarriage was even more so. Nonetheless, it all still affected me mentally and emotionally, even up to this day.

The Alternate Universe Ending Theory: A complete log of all the evidence,"(This is long, but I promise it's worth your time. If I had to place a $500 bet on any AOT ending, I'm going all in on this. Thanks for reading!)

Having been on my university break for quite some time now, I have spent my time arduously attempting to figure out the finale of Attack on Titan. I have created document after document, chatted with other fans, scoured forums; many people have devised some strong theories. However, there is one manga panel that is rarely mentioned and it is one I cannot move past: '**Goth' Mikasa and 'Nerd' Armin (from the Attack on School Castes) appearing in Chapter 120 of the main story.**

&#x200B;

[Here is the panel I am referring to. This shows Eren's PAST memories. Notice the shard in the very top left corner? ](https://preview.redd.it/q1nbd68apwg61.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c812a299881c74a4e263375b25860f3ef9a6333)

[When we zoom in, we can see that this is 'Goth' Mikasa and 'Nerd' Armin. Take note of Mikasa's hairstyle and Armin's glasses...](https://preview.redd.it/7fsn4qicpwg61.jpg?width=361&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0f8dd811f26bb70cf1b3890d540106716850eeb1)

&#x200B;

[See Mikasa's hairstyle and Armin's glasses?](https://preview.redd.it/b2kwptrfpwg61.jpg?width=463&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e7fa63b186b9db1cfdad06707ad6aae6a1e0a986)

For those who are unaware, the 'Attack on School Castes' is an alternate universe where the characters from Attack on Titan live a simple, peaceful life and attend high school. They are included alongside the official manga as 'previews,' and are published at the end of each volume, starting with Volume 21.

Though there are clear comedic purposes to these previews, there are important events that take place in this alternate universe. I will now summarise these quickly, as they serve as the foundation for this theory:

1. In this alternate universe, Eren is seen as a 'nobody,' and is very **bored** with his life. 'Goth' Mikasa and 'Nerd' Armin befriend Eren because he 'protected' them.
2. One day, Eren has a dream that he was fighting a zombie apocalypse at his high school. He woke up from this dream **crying**.
3. After this dream, Eren continually mentions that his life is boring; he wishes that his dream was real, just so his life would be more interesting. He wishes to become a 'threat to all of humanity' just so 'something interesting would happen.' (I'll post this panel below, as I believe it is important).
4. Then Ymir Fritz is on the scene, and she is worshipped as a God. Eren is the only one who can see her.

&#x200B;

[Eren in the Attack on School Castes wishes to become a 'threat to all of humanity' because he is tired of a life where 'nothing happens.' ](https://preview.redd.it/cxarrk5jpwg61.jpg?width=765&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=78d9a149ce01ae8e536d6a4d6f8ac51d47bb4a9d)

Many have brushed off the memory shard of Goth Mikasa and Nerd Armin, stating instead that it's most probably an easter egg. I thought that too, until I stumbled across [this](https://www.snknews.com/post/186889347382/2525-kawakubo-the-initial-draft-isayama-sensei) interview with Isayama:

&#x200B;

>Reporter: What's your favourite fake preview?  
>  
>Isayama: Definitely the High School Caste AU. Even though there are only two pages each time, I spend about five pages worth of time and energy to complete them.  
>  
>Reporter: What’s the appeal of that AU?  
>  
>Isayama: **If possible, I want to draw something that is linked to the original manga’s universe. That’s how I’m approaching it now.**

&#x200B;

The interview was conducted on July 20th, 2019. Chapter 120, where Goth Mikasa and Nerd Armin appeared in the past memory shards, was published on August 9th, 2019 - only a few weeks later. This suggests to us that this memory shard was no mere easter egg - but **may potentially open up the possibility of alternate universes in Attack on Titian**. (I also want to emphasise that this interview took place during the Attack on Titan Finale exhibition; whereby fans could get hints for how the manga will end).

&#x200B;

This brings me to the next piece of the puzzle: One of Isayama's [primary sources of inspiration](https://twitter.com/AoTWiki/status/1186777262701441025?s=19) for Attack on Titan is **Muv Luv Alternative**. In fact, he even stated that the [ending](https://comicbook.com/anime/news/attack-on-titan-ending-inspiration-jurassic-park-manga/) was similarly inspired by Muv Luv. Here's the kicker: The Muv Luv franchise is based around **alternate universes.**

So, to investigate further, I watched various Muv Luv play-throughs and scoured their wiki. I discovered that the similarities between Muv Luv and AOT are striking, for example:

* Both stories involve mindless giants; in AOT these are Titans, in Muv Luv these are BETAs (which are aliens).
* Both stories involve 3D manoeuvring gear.
* Both stories have similar arcs.
* In Muv-Luv, there are certain characters who obtained powers as a byproduct of science mishap, and though they are very powerful, they suffer headaches as a result of this; parallels with Mikasa and the Ackerman powers.

However, the most crazy similarity of all is the beginning of Muv Luv Alternative and AOT; both main characters wake up from a dream crying:

&#x200B;

[In Muv Luv, the main character wakes up from a dream crying. This was in reference to waking up from an alternate universe. ](https://preview.redd.it/2cq7lgplpwg61.jpg?width=1439&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=535d929b1fcebf905b30ce57da4c5e7f7f92db3e)

&#x200B;

[In Chapter 1 of AOT, Eren wakes up in a similar way; having experienced the 'longest dream' and also crying. ](https://preview.redd.it/v1pwgm3opwg61.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5a1b458093651a3d7bac7f79c803a8e20af8fdaa)

&#x200B;

[Interestingly, Eren had the exact same experience in the Attack on School Castes previews. ](https://preview.redd.it/qhj7pf5rpwg61.jpg?width=734&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=08e5d952b3ce86841a6d3bcfbba0b680bdb6df16)

So, knowing all of this, **I devised a theory, linking AOT, the Attack on School Castes and Muv Luv:**

* The memory shard of Goth Mikasa and Nerd Armin was in the past. This means Eren was living in the Attack on School Castes alternate universe first.
* In the Attack on School Castes alternate universe, Eren was tired of his boring life and wanted 'something to happen.' He wanted to destroy humanity. This was his wish.
* In the Attack on School Castes, he made a deal with Ymir for this to come true.
* Everything we have seen from the moment Eren woke up in Chapter 1 of the AOT main manga is a result of Eren's wish being fulfilled. This parallels the plot of Muv Luv, the game we know Isayama took great inspiration from.

I then re-read the manga and re-watched the anime in an attempt to either prove/disprove this theory. My verdict is: **it made more sense.** **Way more sense.** I will attempt to explain the plot of AOT (simplified) through this new lens, and this forms the basis of my evidence for this theory:

&#x200B;

1. In the beginning of AOT, Eren expressed the same boredom and desire for [something to happen.](https://imgur.com/wd4EvBA)
2. Then something did happen; the titans. Humanity was being destroyed, just as Eren in the previous High school Universe wished for.
3. Just as in Muv Luv, Eren's memories of a past, alternate universe would have been wiped (which as a side note, would parallel nicely with the implied memory wiping that the 145th King conducted on Eldians). Because of this, Eren believes he is fighting titans, saving humanity, and is none the wiser.
4. Until, however, he kisses Historia's hand. We still don't know all of what Eren saw. However, if this theory is correct, then I am willing to bet he saw that all of this destruction **was his wish from the start** in a past alternate universe. (And I mean, his [face](https://imgur.com/SQsiWOC) doesn't look too happy).
5. This explains the [panel](https://imgur.com/Wm8FqSz) where Eren is talking to Ramzi perfectly. Eren expresses regret over what is to come (ie. The Rumbling) with the words **'I wished for it. I wanted to wipe it all way.'** Wished = past tense. Wanted = past tense.
6. It also explains this [scene](https://imgur.com/Ia5XRSo) where Eren reflects on kissing Historia's hand retroactively. He says 'even if this was set in stone from the start,' and 'even if this is what I wanted.' Again; wanted = past tense.
7. It similarly explains the [scene](https://imgur.com/w7earKQ) with Hange, where Eren seemingly begs them for 'another way.' However, as mentioned before, there is no other way. This was set in stone from the start due to Eren's wish to destroy humanity. All he can do is to keep moving forward.
8. Since kissing Historia's hand, Eren knows this is all his fault. This is why his attitude and demeanour changes drastically since that occasion. It's why he tries to push away his friends. This regret and shame is foreshadowed in the Attack on Castes [panel](https://imgur.com/aqFzW7B), where Eren says (rather grimly) 'it's all because I wanted to destroy the world.'

&#x200B;

So, if Muv Luv led me to discover these parallels, then **can the plot of Muv Luv Alternative similarly predict the ending of Attack on Titan?** (And let's recall, Isayama himself said the ending of AOT is inspired by Muv Luv).

In a nutshell, the ending of Muv Luv Alternative depicts the main character leaving the alternate universe of destruction for his 'previous world'. He loses all of his memories, and everyone will similarly forget him and what he did.

To translate to Attack on Titan:

* Eren won't stay in the current universe of destruction (what we know as the current world of Attack on Titan).
* Everyone will forget him and what he did, and he will travel (most probably) to the Attack on School Castes universe where he previously resided. Presumably, the other characters will 'travel' too.
* In this universe, I believe there will be two options: Eren will 'wake up' as the same age he was in the Attack on School Castes previews, and the last chapter will *also* include a timeskip that shows Eren as an adult; OR, Eren will 'wake up' in this universe and time will have passed (Eren in Chapter 1 was 10, Eren in Chapter 139 will be 19/20; so 10 years will have passed). Eren depicted as an adult is an important detail (and this will be discussed further below).

&#x200B;

The concept of the AOT characters leaving this universe for another has been heavily foreshadowed before (it's just that most of us didn't think to interpret it literally). As shown below (some examples of many):

&#x200B;

[Mention of a 'world we don't know about yet.' ](https://preview.redd.it/uldgbvxvpwg61.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8de0f6ca6d3da2100569d34ea0fdb521a60baa62)

&#x200B;

[This heavily aligns with the theory that Eren wished for this world of destruction, or 'pain and suffering,' yet another world exists. ](https://preview.redd.it/742tgltxpwg61.jpg?width=752&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b544854b13f8458f2fc3294e7b5403d2764cbb71)

&#x200B;

[This panel is excellent foreshadowing if correct; 'if only those kids could've lived normal lives.' ](https://preview.redd.it/exvnv9yzpwg61.png?width=2037&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9da4059d3b6256aa719c16091883444980fa8c1)

&#x200B;

[Here is further foreshadowing of the characters living 'long, happy lives.' Interestingly, though Eren's motivations have long been confusing - his desire for his friends to live 'long, happy lives' has always been made clear. If we also note what Hange said when talking to Levi about running away, she emphasised that even if they returned to Paradis, the 'Jeagirists control the land with the Spinal Fluid.' So, with only 3 chapters left, the only feasible way I can see the AOT characters living 'long, happy lives' is an alternate universe. ](https://preview.redd.it/88m2bu62qwg61.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0b3ec544f2a8fc56315bc5718ee2594e3848bd8)

&#x200B;

[This is an image that was shown during the Season 3 ending scene. Many have suspected that these are the young Tybur children in a few years time. However, given the current fashion trends seen in Attack on Titan, these uniforms seen far too modern. So instead, could this foreshadow the Tybur children in the alternate universe \(which we know is set in the 21st century?\)](https://preview.redd.it/6hh041e5qwg61.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f076efe6f4551d93837ce3dcd3266748d9dcfc6a)

&#x200B;

[EDITED TO ADD: A user in the comment section also pointed out that in the Akatsuki no Requiem MV \(which appears to foreshadow the ending of AOT\), there is a lot of imagery of a character leaving one world for this city \(seen above\) in an elevator.  Also, if you flip this image to the right side up, the character is actually travelling downwards to this city; parallels nicely with the previous image that says 'underneath this world full of pain and suffering exists another world where light cannot reach.' ](https://preview.redd.it/2fgs5wb7qwg61.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b671166d5172654ace30a80007144a5c3bf512b3)

&#x200B;

However, probably the most striking evidence of all is what Eren says to Ymir in Paths, 'Lend me your strength, I will put an end to **THIS** world.' Grammatically speaking, usually one will say 'I will put an end to THE world,' or 'I will save THE world.' Eren saying he will put an end to THIS world, implies the existence of MORE THAN ONE WORLD.

&#x200B;

[Eren says 'I will put an end to THIS world' rather than I will put an end to THE world. ](https://preview.redd.it/0a9mv1e9qwg61.png?width=533&format=png&auto=webp&s=21b1158cb50544542fc32ba2da47c6c65c2bf14e)

This is also similar to Eren's phrase 'because I was born into **THIS** world.' In fact, when Zeke asks Eren why he is betraying him in Paths and going ahead with the Rumbling, Eren just replies 'because I was born into THIS world.' That's an incredibly vague and weird justification for annihilating the planet - unless you put it into the context of this theory; that Eren is going ahead with the Rumbling because he has no other choice, THIS world of destruction was his wish from the start.

&#x200B;

[Again, born into THIS world, rather than born into THE world. ](https://preview.redd.it/hzzmwiibqwg61.jpg?width=411&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=57ebaecb02a5a0146dccc16d17eaf5ef608a22cc)

&#x200B;

Incase you still weren't convinced, take a look at the [Season 4 **opening** song](https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/My_War#English_). First thing to note, the cover art for this song is of a modern-day classroom. (**Edit**: As of the start of the month, the official art for the Season 4 song 'My War' was released; it depicts [Ymir Fritz in a modern-age classroom](https://imgur.com/JT5HdQJ), further solidifying this theory). Further, the lyrics of this song seem to parallel perfectly to the occurrences in the **previous** Attack on School Castes universe, right as Eren made a deal with Ymir to destroy the world. See some of the notable lyrics below:

>""Let's **start a new life** from the darkness""  
>  
>""**Destruction** and **regeneration**. **You are the real enemy**.""  
>  
>""Time to leave **school**, stepping in others shadows. When I noticed, I was alone at dawn.""  
>  
>""It's okay to **cry** for now. I have to get ready for **tomorrow**. I have to **do my homework and go to bed. My war.**""

&#x200B;

Contrastingly, the [Season 4 **closing** song](https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/Shock#English_) appears to foreshadow the ending, whereby Eren and his friends will return back to their previous alternate universe, losing all memories and proof that they ever existed in the universe of destruction (what we see in Attack on Titan); see some of the notable lyrics below:

>""Someone please disperse  
>  
>The **proof that I existed here**  
>  
>Even if my **bones turned to sand** and **disappeared**  
>  
>**I'm alive**.""

&#x200B;

Finally, I want to point out two **'bonus' puzzle pieces.**

&#x200B;

* The **first** puzzle piece is a key detail that many overlook: the story about the miner in Episode 25 of the anime. You can read [Part 1](https://imgur.com/QOHbRrK) and [Part 2](https://imgur.com/liVUjUp) here.

To **summarise** this story that appeared in the anime intermission: There was a miner that originally dreamt of a better life and as such, wanted to dig his way into Wall Sina. He was an expert at digging, doing so for **20 years.** One night, he finally attempted to dig to a better life; but no matter what he did, it was no use. On the brink of giving up, his friend instead insinuated he should accept and be happy with 'his lot in life.' It was then revealed that the miner suddenly disappeared without a trace, even the pit he had dug had disappeared. His friend also vanished, never to be seen again.

As a parallel, Eren Yeager is currently 19 years old. His birthday is March 30, which is directly before the release of the final chapter of Attack on Titan (April 9). Symbolically speaking, Eren will be **20** in the last chapter of the series. This correlates to the 20 years mentioned in the story of the miner; Eren has been trying, fighting and battling for **20 years**, and though it is theorised that he caused this mess in the first place, he too is striving for a **better life** (as he often refers to '**that scenery.'**) That **better life** can be found in an alternate universe, which is why Eren and friends will similarly disappear without a trace (just like the miner and his friend); they will be finally free from the destruction that Eren wished for.

&#x200B;

* The **second** puzzle piece is that the Attack on Titan manga will end with Chapter 139.

This is rather strange, considering that almost all AOT volumes have included 4 chapters and concluded with an even-numbered chapter. Yes, this could simply be a coincidence or an over-sight. However, it's interesting that when looking at [Numerology](https://angelnumber.org/139-angel-number/), the number 139 represents 'the end of a cycle; it is not a 'real' death, but just the end of one period, and therefore the beginning of another.' This perfectly aligns with Isayama's [own words](https://twitter.com/AttackOnFans/status/1347926278914142208?s=20), as when he was asked about the ending of Attack on Titan, he simply replied **'it's just the beginning**!'

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now I know what you may be thinking; 'what about the infamous [final panel](https://imgur.com/ksfRDXH)? How does that work with this theory?' This could go a number of ways, but I think a huge clue is the **parallels between Grisha and Eren's love interests.** I will break it down:

* Grisha first married Dina, who is of royal blood.
* They birthed a child, Zeke. This child of royal blood  was born to be utilised as a weapon; arguably not 'free.'
* Grisha, then on the brink of death, was given a second chance at life behind the walls. He then married Carla.
* They birthed a child, Eren. This child wasn't raised to be a weapon, and appears to have an innate desire to achieve freedom (even if that restriction and destruction was implemented by him in the first place).

&#x200B;

So, if this theory is correct, let's look at how this parallels with Eren:

* Eren and Historia appear to be allied together at the moment (a whole separate host of evidence for this, but if I digress this theory will be too long). Notably, Historia is also of royal blood; parallels to Dina.
* It is likely at this stage that Eren is the father of Historia's child (again, also has evidence but too lengthy for here). Unless the titan curse is broken in the next 3 chapters, or so as long as the people of Paradis are considered 'subjects of Ymir,' this child will **not** be born free (and the popular reincarnation theory similarly dictates this to be so); parallels to Zeke.
* However, if Eren and the other AOT characters 'wake up' in the Attack on School Castes alternate universe, where presumably time has passed, it is likely that Eren will have a 'second chance,' similar to Grisha; however, this time with Mikasa. (And for further proof, [this panel](https://imgur.com/YawdvDM) in the Attack on School Castes previews shows that Eren clearly has romantic feelings for Mikasa).
* If Eren and Mikasa have a child together in this alternate universe (where again, presumably time has passed), this child will be truly free - as it was not born in THAT world of destruction that Eren wished for, and has now escaped from. This is what I believe the last panel will show, and this was eerily foreshadowed already (see below):
* **Edit**: Following Chapter 137 and 138, this hypothesis may have changed slightly. See the link under 'Additional Comments' for more information.

&#x200B;

[First, notice what Zeke says; 'no one will cast blame on you for forgetting everything about your first family to enjoy this happy life.' This would foreshadow the ending perfectly if this theory is true; that Eren has forgotten everything about his first family \(Historia\) due to the memory wipe, and now experiences a 'happy' life with Mikasa in the alternate universe. Also, notice how Grisha and baby Eren look eerily similar to the father and child in the final panel? However, Grisha does not have a beard here, whereas the man in the final panel clearly does. Instead, I believe the man in that final panel is Eren \(with a beard\), holding his and Mikasa's child. ](https://preview.redd.it/owdxkfceqwg61.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=720bb39cf40cd0fca69a8835a693dc4f7fd63e60)

&#x200B;

To add further credence to the importance of Mikasa and Eren's relationship in the final chapter of Attack on Titan, I would like to highlight an important quote in Muv Luv, said by one of the main love interests:

>You want to meet him again, don't you? Then you should say... 'See you Later. Not goodbye.'

The concept of saying 'See you later' rather than 'Goodbye' is a prominent theme in Muv Luv, and especially pertains to the travel across alternate universes.

Where else have we seen this before? Right at the beginning of AOT:

&#x200B;

[Just like the love interest in Muv Luv, Mikasa says 'see you later,' rather than 'goodbye,' hinting she and Eren will meet again. ](https://preview.redd.it/z586d7igqwg61.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=939016c0e1391431e96c29c232663a5eef57c4e1)

Now, this next part is **purely speculation,** but I believe there could be more to Mikasa's character than we originally suspected:

* We know that as of her father's side, Mikasa is an Ackerman. They are resistant to the powers of the Founding titan; including memory wiping.
* Mikasa is also apart of the 'Oriental' bloodline (through her mother). They are also resistant to the powers of the Founding titan, and again, this includes memory wiping.
* This means that despite being Eldian and able to enter the Paths, both sides of her bloodline are resistant to memory wipes. This puts Mikasa in a very unique position.
* And, when you think about it, the plot point that some clans (such as the Ackerman's and the Oriental Clan) are resistant to the memory wipes has been rather fruitless and purposeless so far. It was not used to reveal any information on the outside world - so why else would Isayama include this detail?
* We know that in Muv Luv, when characters exited an alternate universe, their memories were wiped. What if, when travelling from the previous (Attack on School Castes) universe to the AOT universe (what we see in Chapter 1), Mikasa's memories were not fully wiped?
* This would explain [this panel](https://imgur.com/ZNc5g1A) in Chapter 9 where Mikasa says Armin's abilities have saved them 'many times in the past,' and Armin is confused as to when this occurred.
* Similarly, [this panel](https://imgur.com/lOWAeYS) of Mikasa saying 're-opening the same old wound... do I really have to start everything anew **yet again**?
* What is most convincing are [these panels](https://imgur.com/M2rzpXu) in Chapter 6. Mikasa sees Eren is being choked, and she says 'I'd seen this scene before, over and over again.' She then follows this up in the next panel, talking about the 'cruelty of **THIS** world.' Again, saying THIS world, rather than THE world.
* Most importantly is the phrase '**come back home**,' of which Mikasa says to Eren [multiple times](https://imgur.com/n6Y6Hyg) throughout the manga. Instead of interpreting it literally, what if Mikasa is referring to 'home' as the previous alternate universe in which they came from?
* In fact, in [Mikasa's character song](https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/No_matter_where_you_are), there are multiple important lyrics that link to this theory and going 'back home' with Eren:

>""  When I woke up again, At that moment… I found you""  
>  
>""You are my home to return to, no matter where you are.""

&#x200B;

* In linking with this, the OST 'Name of Love' also potentially foreshadows this theory and Eren and Mikasa meeting again at the finale:

>""**Goodbye world**. Our shadows, standing side by side, do not cross each other.""  
>  
>""somewhere in this world, **if we can meet in the future,** please dont forget... about me""

&#x200B;

Tbh, I am not 100% sure whether Mikasa has retained her memories or not. Irrespective of this, if this alternate universe theory proves to be true, then I still believe it is likely that the final chapter will include Mikasa and the scarf, and the phrase 'lets go home' when going back to the original alternate universe. (**Edit**: Following Chapter 137 and 138, this part of the theory takes on a different interpretation, again see the link at the bottom).

&#x200B;

**Now, answering some of the questions/complaints I can anticipate in the comments:**

* **""A parallel universe is unlikely and comes out of no where.""**

Not necessarily true. The fact that Eren was able to change Grisha's memories without causing a paradox implies that multiple or alternative universes can indeed exist. Further, there have been various hints throughout the series already; such as the Paths and the ability to transcend time, as well as all the symbolism of rebirth and second chances (especially in the latest manga chapters).

**Edit**:  A user in the comment section pointed out the use of a fixed-timeline in AOT, meaning the future cannot be changed. This doesn't mean that alternate universes can't exist, as for example, Paths is quite literally a metaphysical alternate universe; but important to note regarding the above statement.

* **""Eren and Ymir making a deal in the Attack on School Castes (previous/original universe) seems like a reach.""**

Well, have you considered the [original painting](https://imgur.com/bt0vgPj) of Ymir and the Devil, making some sort of deal? We know that Founder Ymir gained her titan powers from an unknown organic material when falling into the tree... so what else could these paintings be depicting, I wonder? And let's not forget who is currently seen as the Devil... (\*cough Eren\*).

Further, it's rather interesting; Ymir was the original 'Founding Titan,' meaning she had the ability to wipe all memories. If she was the one involved with Eren in the School Castes universe (where she is viewed as a 'God'), and partook in his deal,  this could explain how the new universe (and subsequently wiped memories of the previous universe) came to be. Further, I believe that in Norse Mythology, 'Ymir' was symbolic of the creation of Earth; this could potentially be excellent symbolism of the role Ymir Fritz plays in the creation/manipulation of the two universes I am theorising about.

Additionally, and this might be the most concrete proof of all; if we go back to the Chapter 120 manga panel with the memory shards of Eren's **past** (the one with Goth Mikasa and Nerd Armin), down the bottom left is Ymir Fritz. Eren hadn't met her yet, so why was she in Eren's past memories at this stage? Unless, of course, they'd already met in a previous alternate universe to make the aforementioned 'deal.'

&#x200B;

[Ymir Fritz in the Chp 120 memory shard panel; depicting Eren's 'past' memories. ](https://preview.redd.it/howslmqiqwg61.png?width=228&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd397ac18435ccc318f38e076e6b9dc59f680ebe)

As a final note; the first Chapter of AOT when Eren wakes up from his 'dream' is titled, 'To you, 2000 years from now,' and then the Chapter when Eren finally reunites with Ymir Fritz is titled 'From you, 2000 years ago.' What does Eren say in the latter chapter? **It ends now.**

**""Okay, but why The Rumbling? It doesn't seem like Ymir or Eren want this.""**

This is the one thing that Isayama would be yet to explain, and is a probable reason as to why Eren and Ymir's true motivations and points of view have been shrouded in mystery. However, if we theorise that Eren made a deal with Ymir in the past alternate universe to 'destroy humanity,' then Eren must fulfil this deal and either complete that mission, or be killed in the process. This was hinted already during the [scene](https://imgur.com/9DX2aMk) where Eren Kurger says to Grisha 'if you want to save Armin and Mikasa, then you need to fulfil your mission.' If we know that attack titan inheritors are connected- then perhaps was this meant for Eren? Is this why he 'keeps moving forward?'

* **""But I've seen X, Y, Z theory and it sounds much more plausible.""**

The beauty of this theory is that there will be essentially two endings; a conclusion to the universe we see in Attack on Titan (most likely Chapter 137 and 138), and then a conclusion to the entire story (Chapter 139), of which I predict will be Eren and co. travelling back to their previous universe and finally being 'free.' So, your favourite theory within the AOT universe could still happen.

* **""There's only a few chapters left, I doubt this will happen.""**

Actually, the fact that there are only a few chapters left strengthens this theory. Just as in Muv Luv, and just as in that story of the miner digging under the wall - the characters suddenly vanish. 3 chapters is not a lot of space to tie up every last loose end, but this isn't needed if Eren and his friends suddenly travel to their previous universe.

Also, consider again the picture of the Tybur children in the school uniform. They are a little older in that photo (maybe 5-7 years or so older). If the last panel is of Eren holding Historia's baby (with no alternate universes), then you'd also need to have a time skip to show these Tybur children... that doesn't work out. However, if there is an alternate universe where time has passed... it does.

* **""Isayama said the story doesn't have a happy ending, this is a happy ending!""**

Isayama actually [said](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/c9phsx/manga_spoilers_final_exhibition_interview_with/) he wanted to betray the reader. I also think this ending will shock a lot of people, and potentially be quite controversial. Interestingly, Isayama included a little text bubble in the Attack on School Castes that said, with no real context, ""I do feel ashamed about the reveal being a dream."" (See below).

&#x200B;

[Does this hint that Eren in the final chapters will wake up in the previous universe, memories lost - just like Chapter 1? Is this the big 'reveal' that Isayama is 'ashamed' of?](https://preview.redd.it/5ok6li3lqwg61.jpg?width=175&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9ba13a98c1556d1f622aaa70ce177ea0f36e28d1)

* **""From a narrative point of view, this ending sucks. It's cliche and I've seen it done before.""**

First and foremost, I don't think Isayama could ever create an ending where everyone is happy (I mean, just look at the divide in the community between Jeagerist and Alliance supporters). However, I do think he could create an ending that no one would expect - and this theory is exactly that. Yes, there are plenty of isekai animes, or stories involving alternative universes - but it seems that most of these characters travel in time/space for benevolent reasons. I personally haven't seen a story where a character travels to an alternate universe purely to destroy it, just because he was 'bored' and 'wanted something to happen.' It would also mean that for over a decade, Eren was the true villain of the story, and we were none the wiser. What better way to betray your readers than that?

* **How would this work for the anime-only viewers?**

To date, there are only \~10 School Caste previews. It's looking likely that there may be a Season 4, Part 2. In this instance, the School Caste previews could still be animated (perhaps as part of the ending theme, as these usually foreshadow events to come).

However, even if these previews aren't animated, as you can tell from the absurd length of this post (sorry!), there is still significant evidence that exists outside of these previews.

# 0. Preface

I am not a financial advisor, and I do not provide financial advice. Many thoughts here are my opinion, and others can be speculative.

TL;DR - (Though I think you REALLY should consider reading because it is important to understand what is going on):

* The market crash of 2008 never finished. It was can-kicked and the same people who caused the crash have still been running rampant doing the same bullshit in the derivatives market as that market continues to be unregulated. They're profiting off of short-term gains at the risk of killing their institutions and potentially the global economy. Only this time it is much, much worse.
* The bankers abused smaller amounts of leverage for the 2008 bubble and have since abused much higher amounts of leverage - creating an even larger speculative bubble. Not just in the stock market and derivatives market, but also in the crypt0 market, upwards of 100x leverage.
* COVID came in and rocked the economy to the point where the Fed is now pinned between a rock and a hard place. In order to buy more time, the government triggered a flurry of protective measures, such as mortgage forbearance, expiring end of Q2 on June 30th, 2021, and SLR exemptions, which expired March 31, 2021. The market was going to crash regardless. GME was and never will be the reason for the market crashing.
* The rich made a fatal error in way overshorting stocks. There is a potential for their decades of sucking money out of taxpayers to be taken back. The derivatives market is potentially a $1 Quadrillion market. ""Meme prices"" are not meme prices. There is so much money in the world, and you are just accustomed to thinking the ""meme prices"" are too high to feasibly reach.
* The DTC, ICC, OCC have been passing rules and regulations (auction and wind-down plans) so that they can easily eat up competition and consolidate power once again like in 2008. The people in charge, including Gary Gensler, are not your friends.
* The DTC, ICC, OCC are also passing rules to make sure that retail will never be able to to do this again. These rules are for the future market (post market crash) and they never want anyone to have a chance to take their game away from them again. These rules are not to start the MOASS. They are indirectly regulating retail so that a short squeeze condition can never occur after GME.
* The COVID pandemic exposed a lot of banks through the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) where mass borrowing (leverage) almost made many banks default. Banks have account 'blocks' on the Fed's balance sheet which holds their treasuries and deposits. The SLR exemption made it so that these treasuries and deposits of the banks 'accounts' on the Fed's balance sheet were not calculated into SLR, which allowed them to boost their SLR until March 31, 2021 and avoid defaulting. Now, they must extract treasuries from the Fed in reverse repo to avoid defaulting from SLR requirements. This results in the reverse repo market explosion as they are scrambling to survive due to their mass leverage.
* This is not a ""retail vs. Melvin/Point72/Citadel"" issue. This is a ""retail vs. Mega Banks"" issue. The rich, and I mean all of Wall Street, are trying desperately to shut GameStop down because it has the chance to suck out trillions if not hundreds of trillions from the game they've played for decades. They've rigged this game since the 1990's when derivatives were first introduced. Do you really think they, including the Fed, wouldn't pull all the stops now to try to get you to sell?

End TL;DR



A ton of the information provided in this post is from the movie Inside Job (2010). I am paraphrasing from the movie as well as taking direct quotes, so please understand that a bunch of this information is a summary of that film.

I understand that The Big Short (2015) is much more popular here, due to it being a more Hollywood style movie, but it does not go into such great detail of the conditions that led to the crash - and how things haven't even changed. But in fact, got worse, and led us to where we are now.

Seriously. Go. Watch. Inside Job. It is a documentary with interviews of many people, including those who were involved in the Ponzi Scheme of the derivative market bomb that led to the crash of 2008, and their continued lobbying to influence the Government to keep regulations at bay.

# 1. The Market Crash Of 2008

# 1.1 The Casino Of The Financial World: The Derivatives Market

It all started back in the 1990's when the Derivative Market was created. This was the opening of the literal Casino in the financial world. These are bets placed upon an underlying asset, index, or entity, and are very risky. Derivatives are contracts between two or more parties that derives its value from the performance of the underlying asset, index, or entity.

One such derivative many are familiar with are options (CALLs and PUTs). Other examples of derivatives are fowards, futures, swaps, and variations of those such as Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs), and Credit Default Swaps (CDS).

The potential to make money off of these trades is insane. Take your regular CALL option for example. You no longer take home a 1:1 return when the underlying stock rises or falls $1. Your returns can be amplified by magnitudes more. Sometimes you might make a 10:1 return on your investment, or 20:1, and so forth.

Not only this, you can grab leverage by borrowing cash from some other entity. This allows your bets to potentially return that much more money. You can see how this gets out of hand really fast, because the amount of cash that can be gained absolutely skyrockets versus traditional investments.

Attempts were made to regulate the derivatives market, but due to mass lobbying from Wall Street, regulations were continuously shut down. People continued to try to pass regulations, until in 2000, the [Commodity Futures Modernization Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_Futures_Modernization_Act_of_2000) banned the regulation of derivatives outright.

And of course, once the Derivatives Market was left unchecked, it was off to the races for Wall Street to begin making tons of risky bets and surging their profits.

The Derivative Market exploded in size once regulation was banned and de-regulation of the financial world continued. You can see as of 2000, the cumulative derivatives market was already out of control.

The Derivatives Market is big. Insanely big. Look at how it compares to Global Wealth.

[https://www.visualcapitalist.com/all-of-the-worlds-money-and-markets-in-one-visualization-2020/](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/all-of-the-worlds-money-and-markets-in-one-visualization-2020/)

At the bottom of the list are three derivatives entries, with ""Market Value"" and ""Notional Value"" called out.

The ""Market Value"" is the value of the derivative at its current trading price.

The ""Notional Value"" is the value of the derivative if it was at the strike price.

E.g. A CALL option (a derivative) represents 100 shares of ABC stock with a strike of $50. Perhaps it is trading in the market at $1 per contract right now.

* Market Value = 100 shares \* $1.00 per contract = $100
* Notional Value = 100 shares \* $50 strike price = $5,000

Visual Capitalist estimates that the cumulative Notional Value of derivatives is between $558 Trillion and $1 Quadrillion. So yeah. You are not going to cause a market crash if GME sells for millions per share. The rich are already priming the market crash through the Derivatives Market.

# 1.2 CDOs And Mortgage Backed Securities

Decades ago, the system of paying mortgages used to be between two parties. The buyer, and the loaner. Since the movement of money was between the buyer and the loaner, the loaner was very careful to ensure that the buyer would be able to pay off their loan and not miss payments.

But now, it's a chain.

1. Home buyers will buy a loan from the lenders.
2. The lenders will then sell those loans to Investment Banks.
3. The Investment Banks then combine thousands of mortgages and other loans, including car loans, student loans, and credit card debt to create complex derivatives called ""Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDO's)"".
4. The Investment Banks then pay Rating Agencies to rate their CDO's. This can be on a scale of ""AAA"", the best possible rating, equivalent to government-backed securities, all the way down to C/D, which are junk bonds and very risky. Many of these CDO's were given AAA ratings despite being filled with junk.
5. The Investment Banks then take these CDO's and sell them to investors, including retirement funds, because that was the rating required for retirement funds as they would only purchase highly rated securities.
6. Now when the homeowner pays their mortgage, the money flows directly into the investors. The investors are the main ones who will be hurt if the CDO's containing the mortgages begin to fail.

# 1.3 The Bubble of Subprime Loans Packed In CDOs

This system became a ticking timebomb due to this potential of free short-term gain cash. Lenders didn't care if a borrower could repay, so they would start handing out riskier loans. The investment banks didn't care if there were riskier loans, because the more CDO's sold to investors resulted in more profit. And the Rating Agencies didn't care because there were no regulatory constraints and there was no liability if their ratings of the CDO's proved to be wrong.

So they went wild and pumped out more and more loans, and more and more CDOs. Between 2000 and 2003, the number of mortgage loans made each year nearly quadrupled. They didn’t care about the quality of the mortgage - they cared about maximizing the volume and getting profit out of it.

In the early 2000s there was a huge increase in the riskiest loans - “Subprime Loans”. These are loans given to people who have low income, limited credit history, poor credit, etc. They are very at risk to not pay their mortgages. It was predatory lending, because it hunted for potential home buyers who would never be able to pay back their mortgages so that they could continue to pack these up into CDO's.

Inside Job (2010) - % Of Subprime Loans

In fact, the investment banks preferred subprime loans, because they carried higher interest rates and more profit for them.

So the Investment Banks took these subprime loans, packaged the subprime loans up into CDO's, and many of them still received AAA ratings. These can be considered ""toxic CDO's"" because of their high ability to default and fail despite their ratings.

Pretty much anyone could get a home now. Purchases of homes and housing prices skyrocketed. It didn't matter because everyone in the chain was making money in an unregulated market.

# 1.4 Short Term Greed At The Risk Of Institutional And Economic Failure

In Wall Street, annual cash bonuses started to spike. Traders and CEOs became extremely wealthy in this bubble as they continued to pump more toxic CDO's into the market. Lehman Bros. was one of the top underwriters of subprime lending and their CEO alone took home over $485 million in bonuses.

Inside Job (2010) Wall Street Bonuses

And it was all short-term gain, high risk, with no worries about the potential failure of your institution or the economy. When things collapsed, they would not need to pay back their bonuses and gains. They were literally risking the entire world economy for the sake of short-term profits.

AND THEY EVEN TOOK IT FURTHER WITH LEVERAGE TO MAXIMIZE PROFITS.

During the bubble from 2000 to 2007, the investment banks were borrowing heavily to buy more loans and to create more CDO's. The ratio of banks borrowed money and their own money was their leverage. The more they borrowed, the higher their leverage. They abused leverage to continue churning profits. And are still abusing massive leverage to this day. It might even be much higher leverage today than what it was back in the Housing Market Bubble.

In 2004, Henry Paulson, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, helped lobby the SEC to relax limits on leverage, allowing the banks to sharply increase their borrowing. Basically, the SEC allowed investment banks to gamble a lot more. Investment banks would go up to about 33-to-1 leverage at the time of the 2008 crash. Which means if a 3% decrease occurred in their asset base, it would leave them insolvent. Henry Paulson would later become the Secretary Of The Treasury from 2006 to 2009. He was just one of many Wall Street executives to eventually make it into Government positions. Including the infamous Gary Gensler, the current SEC chairman, who helped block derivative market regulations.

Inside Job (2010) Leverage Abuse of 2008

The borrowing exploded, the profits exploded, and it was all at the risk of obliterating their institutions and possibly the global economy. Some of these banks knew that they were ""too big to fail"" and could push for bailouts at the expense of taxpayers. Especially when they began planting their own executives in positions of power.

# 1.5 Credit Default Swaps (CDS)

To add another ticking bomb to the system, AIG, the worlds largest insurance company, got into the game with another type of derivative. They began selling Credit Default Swaps (CDS).

For investors who owned CDO's, CDS's worked like an insurance policy. An investor who purchased a CDS paid AIG a quarterly premium. If the CDO went bad, AIG promised to pay the investor for their losses. Think of it like insuring a car. You're paying premiums, but if you get into an accident, the insurance will pay up (some of the time at least).

But unlike regular insurance, where you can only insure your car once, speculators could also purchase CDS's from AIG in order to bet against CDO's they didn't own. You could suddenly have a sense of rehypothecation where fifty, one hundred entities might now have insurance against a CDO.

Inside Job (2010) Payment Flow of CDS's

If you've watched The Big Short (2015), you might remember the Credit Default Swaps, because those are what Michael Burry and others purchased to bet against the Subprime Mortgage CDO's.

CDS's were unregulated, so AIG didn’t have to set aside any money to cover potential losses. Instead, AIG paid its employees huge cash bonuses as soon as contracts were signed in order to incentivize the sales of these derivatives. But if the CDO's later went bad, AIG would be on the hook. It paid everyone short-term gains while pushing the bill to the company itself without worrying about footing the bill if shit hit the fan. People once again were being rewarded with short-term profit to take these massive risks.

AIG’s Financial Products division in London issued over $500B worth of CDS's during the bubble. Many of these CDS's were for CDO's backed by subprime mortgages.

The 400 employees of AIGFP made $3.5B between 2000 and 2007. And the head of AIGFP personally made $315M.

# 1.6 The Crash And Consumption Of Banks To Consolidate Power

By late 2006, Goldman Sachs took it one step further. It didn’t just sell toxic CDO's, it started actively betting against them at the same time it was telling customers that they were high-quality investments.

Goldman Sachs would purchase CDS's from AIG and bet against CDO's it didn’t own, and got paid when those CDO's failed. Goldman bought at least $22B in CDS's from AIG, and it was so much that Goldman realized AIG itself might go bankrupt (which later on it would and the Government had to bail them out). So Goldman spent $150M insuring themselves against AIG’s potential collapse. They purchased CDS's against AIG.

Inside Job (2010) Payment From AIG To Goldman Sachs If CDO's Failed

Then in 2007, Goldman went even further. They started selling CDO's specifically designed so that the more money their customers lost, the more Goldman Sachs made.

Many other banks did the same. They created shitty CDO's, sold them, while simultaneously bet that they would fail with CDS's. All of these CDO's were sold to customers as “safe” investments because of the complicit Rating Agencies.

The three rating agencies, Moody’s, S&P and Fitch, made billions of dollars giving high ratings to these risky securities. Moody’s, the largest ratings agency, quadrupled its profits between 2000 and 2007. The more AAA's they gave out, the higher their compensation and earnings were for the quarter. AAA ratings mushroomed from a handful in 2000 to thousands by 2006. Hundreds of billions of dollars worth of CDO's were being rated AAA per year. When it all collapsed and the ratings agencies were called before Congress, the rating agencies expressed that it was “their opinion” of the rating in order to weasel their way out of blame. Despite knowing that they were toxic and did not deserve anything above 'junk' rating.

Inside Job (2010) Ratings Agencies ProfitsInside Job (2010) - Insane Increase of AAA Rated CDOs

By 2008, home foreclosures were skyrocketing. Home buyers in the subprime loans were defaulting on their payments. Lenders could no longer sell their loans to the investment banks. And as the loans went bad, dozens of lenders failed. The market for CDO's collapsed, leaving the investment banks holding hundreds of billions of dollars in loans, CDO's, and real estate they couldn’t sell. Meanwhile, those who purchased up CDS's were knocking at the door to be paid.

In March 2008, Bear Stearns ran out of cash and was acquired for $2 a share by JPMorgan Chase. The deal was backed by $30B in emergency guarantees by the Fed Reserve. This was just one instance of a bank getting consumed by a larger entity.

[https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/bear-stearns-sold-to-j-p-morgan-chase](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/bear-stearns-sold-to-j-p-morgan-chase)

AIG, Bear Stearns, Lehman Bros, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac, were all AA or above rating days before either collapsing or being bailed out. Meaning they were 'very secure', yet they failed.

The Fed Reserve and Big Banks met together in order to discuss bailouts for different banks, and they decided to let Lehman Brothers fail as well.

The Government also then took over AIG, and a day after the takeover, asked the Government for $700B in bailouts for big banks. At this point in time, the person in charge of handling the financial crisis, Henry Paulson, former CEO of Goldman Sachs, worked with the chairman of the Federal Reserve to force AIG to pay Goldman Sachs some of its bailout money at 100-cents on the dollar. Meaning there was no negotiation of lower prices. Conflict of interest much?

The Fed and Henry Paulson also forced AIG to surrender their right to sue Goldman Sachs and other banks for fraud.

This is but a small glimpse of the consolidation of power in big banks from the 2008 crash. They let others fail and scooped up their assets in the crisis.

After the crash of 2008, big banks are more powerful and more consolidated than ever before. And the DTC, ICC, OCC rules are planning on making that worse through the auction and wind-down plans where big banks can once again consume other entities that default.

# 1.7 The Can-Kick To Continue The Game Of Derivative Market Greed

After the crisis, the financial industry worked harder than ever to fight reform. The financial sector, as of 2010, employed over 3000 lobbyists. More than five for each member of Congress. Between 1998 and 2008 the financial industry spent over $5B on lobbying and campaign contributions. And ever since the crisis, they’re spending even more money.

President Barack Obama campaigned heavily on ""Change"" and ""Reform"" of Wall Street, but when in office, nothing substantial was passed. But this goes back for decades - the Government has been in the pocket of the rich for a long time, both parties, both sides, and their influence through lobbying undoubtedly prevented any actual change from occurring.

So their game of playing the derivative market was green-lit to still run rampant following the 2008 crash and mass bailouts from the Government at the expense of taxpayers.

There's now more consolidation of banks, more consolidation of power, more years of deregulation, and over a decade that they used to continue the game. And just like in 2008, it's happening again. We're on the brink of another market crash and potentially a global financial crisis.

# 2. The New CDO Game, And How COVID Uppercut To The System

# 2.1 Abuse Of Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities

It's not just [](https://www.reddit.com/user/atobitt/)'s ""House Of Cards"" where the US Treasury Market has been abused. It is abuse of many forms of collateral and securities this time around.

It's the same thing as 2008, but much worse due to even higher amounts of leverage in the system on top of massive amounts of liquidity and potential inflation from stimulus money of the COVID crisis.

Here's an excerpt from [The Bigger Short: Wall Street's Cooked Books Fueled The Financial Crisis of 2008. It's Happening Again](https://theintercept.com/2021/04/20/wall-street-cmbs-dollar-general-ladder-capital/):

>

They've been abusing Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities (CMBS) this time around, and potentially have still been abusing other forms of collateral - they might still be hitting MBS as well as treasury bonds per [](https://www.reddit.com/user/atobitt/)'s DD.

John M. Griffin and Alex Priest released a study last November. They sampled almost 40,000 CMBS loans with a market capitalization of $650 billion underwritten from the beginning of 2013 to the end of 2019. Their findings were that large banks had 35% or more loans exhibiting 5% or greater income overstatements.

The below chart shows the overstatements of the biggest problem-making banks. The difference in bars is between samples taken from data between 2013-2015, and then data between 2016-2019. Almost every single bank experienced a positive move up over time of overstatements.

[https://theintercept.com/2021/04/20/wall-street-cmbs-dollar-general-ladder-capital/](https://theintercept.com/2021/04/20/wall-street-cmbs-dollar-general-ladder-capital/)

So what does this mean? It means they've once again been handing out subprime loans (predatory loans). But this time to businesses through Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities.

Just like Mortgage-Backed Securities from 2000 to 2007, the loaners will go around, hand out loans to businesses, and rake in the profits while having no concern over the potential for the subprime loans failing.

# 2.2 COVID's Uppercut Sent Them Scrambling

The system was propped up to fail just like from the 2000-2007 Housing Market Bubble. Now we are in a speculative bubble of the entire market along with the Commercial Market Bubble due to continued mass leverage abuse of the world.

Hell - also in Crypt0currencies that were introduced after the 2008 crash. Did you know that you can get over 100x leverage in crypt0 right now? Imagine how terrifying that crash could be if the other markets fail.

There is SO. MUCH. LEVERAGE. ABUSE. IN. THE. WORLD. All it takes is one fatal blow to bring it all down - and it sure as hell looks like COVID was that uppercut to send everything into a death spiral.

When COVID hit, many people were left without jobs. Others had less pay from the jobs they kept. It rocked the financial world and it was so unexpected. Apartment residents would now become delinquent, causing the apartment complexes to become delinquent. Business owners would be hurting for cash to pay their mortgages as well due to lack of business. The subprime loans all started to become a really big issue.

Delinquency rates of Commercial Mortgages started to skyrocket when the COVID crisis hit. They even surpassed 2008 levels in March of 2020. Remember what happened in 2008 when this occurred? When delinquency rates went up on mortgages in 2008, the CDO's of those mortgages began to fail. But, this time, they can-kicked it because COVID caught them all off guard.

[https://theintercept.com/2021/04/20/wall-street-cmbs-dollar-general-ladder-capital/](https://theintercept.com/2021/04/20/wall-street-cmbs-dollar-general-ladder-capital/)

# 2.3 Can-Kick Of COVID To Prevent CDO's From Defaulting Before Being Ready

COVID sent them Scrambling. They could not allow these CDO's to fail just yet, because they wanted to get their rules in place to help them consume other failing entities at a whim.

Like in 2008, they wanted to not only protect themselves when the nuke went off from these decades of derivatives abuse, they wanted to be able to scoop up the competition easily. That is when the DTC, ICC, and OCC began drafting their auction and wind-down plans.

In order to buy time, they began tossing out emergency relief ""protections"" for the economy. Such as preventing mortgage defaults which would send their CDO's tumbling. This protection ends on June 30th, 2021.

And guess what? Many people are still at risk of being delinquent. [This article](https://therealdeal.com/issues_articles/defusing-the-forbearance-time-bomb/) was posted just yesterday. The moment these protection plans lift, we can see a surge in foreclosures as delinquent payments have accumulated over the past year.

When everyone, including small business owners who were attacked with predatory loans, begin to default from these emergency plans expiring, it can lead to the CDO's themselves collapsing. Which is exactly what triggered the 2008 recession.

# 2.4 SLR Requirement Exemption - Why The Reverse Repo Is Blowing Up

Another big issue exposed from COVID is when SLR requirements were leaned during the pandemic. They had to pass a quick measure to protect the banks from defaulting in April of 2020.

>

What can you take from the above?

SLR is based on the banks deposits with the Fed itself. It is the treasuries and deposits that the banks have on the Fed's balance sheet. Banks have an 'account block' on the Fed's balance sheet that holds treasuries and deposits. The SLR pandemic rule allowed them to neglect these treasuries and deposits from their SLR calculation, and it boosted their SLR value, allowing them to survive defaults.

This is a big, big, BIG sign that the banks are way overleveraged by borrowing tons of money just like in 2008.

The SLR is the ""Supplementary Leverage Ratio"" and they enacted quick to allow it so banks wouldn't fail under mass leverage for failing to maintain enough equity.

>

[Here is an exposure of their SLR](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/07/26/which-of-the-large-us-banks-is-most-leveraged.aspx) from earlier this year. The key is to have high SLR, above 5%, as a top-tier bank:

|Bank|Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR)|
|:-|:-|
||
|JP Morgan Chase|6.8%|
|Bank Of America|7%|
|Citigroup|6.7%|
|Goldman Sachs|6.7%|
|Morgan Stanley|7.3%|
|Bank of New York Mellon|8.2%|
|State Street|8.3%|

The SLR protection ended on March 31, 2021. Guess what started to happen just after?

The reverse repo market started to explode. This is VERY unusual behavior because it is not at a quarter-end where quarter-ends have significant strain on the economy. The build-up over time implies that there is significant strain on the market AS OF ENTERING Q2 (April 1st - June 30th).

[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RRPONTSYD](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RRPONTSYD)

Speculation: SLR IS DEPENDENT ON THEIR DEPOSITS WITH THE FED ITSELF. THEY NEED TO EXTRACT TREASURIES OVER NIGHT TO KEEP THEM OFF THE FED'S BALANCE SHEETS TO PREVENT THEMSELVES FROM FAILING SLR REQUIREMENTS AND DEFAULTING DUE TO MASS OVERLEVERAGE. EACH BANK HAS AN ACCOUNT ON THE FED'S BALANCE SHEET, WHICH IS WHAT SLR IS CALCULATED AGAINST. THIS IS WHY IT IS EXPLODING. THEY ARE ALL STRUGGLING TO MEET SLR REQUIREMENTS.

# 2.5 DTC, ICC, OCC Wind-Down and Auction Plans; Preparing For More Consolidation Of Power

We've seen some interesting rules from the DTC, ICC, and OCC. For the longest time we thought this was all surrounding GameStop. Guess what. They aren't all about GameStop. Some of them are, but not all of them.

They are furiously passing these rules because the COVID can-kick can't last forever. The Fed is dealing with the potential of runaway inflation from COVID stimulus and they can't allow the overleveraged banks to can-kick any more. They need to resolve this as soon as possible. June 30th could be the deadline because of the potential for CDO's to begin collapsing.

Let's revisit a few of these rules. The most important ones, in my opinion, because they shed light on the bullshit they're trying to do once again: Scoop up competitors at the cheap, and protect themselves from defaulting as well.

* DTC-004: Wind-down and auction plan. - [Link](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/dtc/2021/34-91429.pdf)
* ICC-005: Wind-down and auction plan. - [Link](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/icc/2021/34-91806.pdf)
* OCC-004: Auction plan. Allows third parties to join in. - [Link](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/occ/2021/34-91935.pdf)
* OCC-003: Shielding plan. Protects the OCC. - [Link](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/occ/2021/34-92038.pdf)

Each of these plans, in brief summary, allows each branch of the market to protect themselves in the event of major defaults of members. They also allow members to scoop up assets of defaulting members.

What was that? Scooping up assets? In other words it is more concentration of power. Less competition.

I would not be surprised if many small and large Banks, Hedge Funds, and Financial Institutions evaporate and get consumed after this crash and we're left with just a select few massive entities. That is, after all, exactly what they're planning for.

They could not allow the COVID crash to pop their massive speculative derivative bubble so soon. It came too sudden for them to not all collapse instead of just a few of them. It would have obliterated the entire economy even more so than it will once this bomb is finally let off. They needed more time to prepare so that they could feast when it all comes crashing down.

# 2.6 Signs Of Collapse Coming - ICC-014 - Incentives For Credit Default Swaps

A comment on this subreddit made me revisit a rule passed by the ICC. It flew under the radar and is another sign for a crash coming.

This is [ICC-014](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/icc/2021/34-91922.pdf). Passed and effective as of June 1st, 2021.

Seems boring at first. Right? That's why it flew under the radar?

But now that you know the causes of the 2008 market crash and how toxic CDO's were packaged together, and then CDS's were used to bet against those CDO's, check out what ICC-014 is doing as of June 1st.

ICC-014 Proposed Discounts On Credit Default Index Swaptions

They are providing incentive programs to purchase Credit Default Swap Indexes. These are like standard CDS's, but packaged together like an index. Think of it like an index fund.

This is allowing them to bet against a wide range of CDO's or other entities at a cheaper rate. Buyers can now bet against a wide range of failures in the market. They are allowing upwards of 25% discounts.

There's many more indicators that are pointing to a market collapse. But I will leave that to you to investigate more. Here is quite a scary compilation of charts relating the current market trends to the crashes of Black Monday, The Internet Bubble, The 2008 Housing Market Crash, and Today.

Summary of Recent Warnings Re Intermediate Trend In Equities







# 3. The Failure Of The 1% - How GameStop Can Deal A Fatal Blow To Wealth Inequality

# 3.1 GameStop Was Never Going To Cause The Market Crash

GameStop was meant to die off. The rich bet against it many folds over, and it was on the brink of Bankruptcy before many conditions led it to where it is today.

It was never going to cause the market crash. And it never will cause the crash. The short squeeze is a result of high abuse of the derivatives market over the past decade, where Wall Street's abuse of this market has primed the economy for another market crash on their own.

We can see this because when COVID hit, GameStop was a non-issue in the market. The CDO market around CMBS was about to collapse on its own because of the instantaneous recession which left mortgage owners delinquent.

If anyone, be it the media, the US Government, or others, try to blame this crash on GameStop or anything other than the Banks and Wall Street, they are WRONG.

# 3.2 The Rich Are Trying To Kill GameStop. They Are Terrified

In January, the SI% was reported to be 140%. But it is very likely that it was underreported at that time. Maybe it was 200% back then. 400%. 800%. Who knows. From the above you can hopefully gather that Wall Street takes on massive risks all the time, they do not care as long as it churns them short-term profits. There is loads of evidence pointing to shorts never covering by hiding their SI% through malicious options practices, and manipulating the price every step of the way.

The conditions that led GameStop to where it is today is a miracle in itself, and the support of retail traders has led to expose a fatal mistake of the rich. Because a short position has infinite loss potential. There is SO much money in the world, especially in the derivatives market.

This should scream to you that any price target that you think is low, could very well be extremely low in YOUR perspective. You might just be accustomed to thinking ""$X price floor is too much money. There's no way it can hit that"". I used to think that too, until I dove deep into this bullshit.

The market crashing no longer was a matter of simply scooping up defaulters, their assets, and consolidating power. The rich now have to worry about the potential of infinite losses from GameStop and possibly other meme stocks with high price floor targets some retail have.

It's not a fight against Melvin / Citadel / Point72. It's a battle against the entire financial world. There is even speculation from multiple people that the Fed is even being complicit right now in helping suppress GameStop. Their whole game is at risk here.

Don't you think they'd fight tooth-and-nail to suppress this and try to get everyone to sell?

That they'd pull every trick in the book to make you think that they've covered?

The amount of money they could lose is unfathomable.

With the collapsing SI%, it is mathematically impossible for the squeeze to have happened - its mathematically impossible for them to have covered. [](https://www.reddit.com/user/atobitt/) also discusses this in [House of Cards Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nlwaxv/house_of_cards_part_2/).

[https://www.thebharatexpressnews.com/short-squeeze-could-save-gamestop-investors-a-third-time/](https://www.thebharatexpressnews.com/short-squeeze-could-save-gamestop-investors-a-third-time/)

And in regards to all the other rules that look good for the MOASS - I see them in a negative light.

They are passing NSCC-002/801, DTC-005, and others, in order to prevent a GameStop situation from ever occurring again.

They realized how much power retail could have from piling into a short squeeze play. These new rules will snap new emerging short squeezes instantly if the conditions of a short squeeze ever occur again. There will never be a GameStop situation after this.

It's their game after all. They've been abusing the derivative market game for decades and GameStop is a huge threat. It was supposed to be, ""crash the economy and run with the money"". Not ""crash the economy and pay up to retail"". But GameStop was a flaw exposed by their greed, the COVID crash, and the quick turn-around of the company to take it away from the brink of bankruptcy.

The rich are now at risk of losing that money and insane amounts of cash that they've accumulated over the years from causing the Internet Bubble Crash of 2000, and the Housing Market Crash of 2008.

"Should you listen to Jim Cramer? - I analyzed 20,000+ recommendations made by Jim Cramer during the last 5 years. Here are the results.","Jim Cramer has made 21,609 stock picks in the past 5 years! Let that sink in for a moment. Here is one person, making buy/sell/hold recommendations on more than 2,200+ different stocks across all types of industries. On average, he was making more than 20 picks per episode of his show \[1\]. This is a staggering number of picks to be made by one person! \[2\]

While we can all argue about his expertise in making recommendations on such a wide array of industries and companies, what I wanted to know was:

1. **How accurate were his recommendations?**
2. **Would you have made or lost money if you followed them?**
3. **Can you beat the market following his picks?**

So it’s high time that we put Cramer to the ultimate test and end the debate about his usefulness once and for all!

https://preview.redd.it/ky8qh0nzeo981.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=104b963a012fc82a7a12585615dbd98c402e0a26

**Analysis**

The data about all the stock picks made by Cramer are available [here](https://madmoney.thestreet.com/screener/index.cfm) \[3\]. The picks are classified into five segments (Buy, Hold, Sell, Positive/Negative mention). I have calculated the return for each segment separately \[4\] so that we can know what to focus on if we are trying to replicate this strategy.

Since Cramer frequently contradicts his own picks and is mainly focused on short-term trades, I am only analyzing the stock returns for the following periods \[5\].

a. One-day

b. One-Week

c. One-Month

Given that Mad Money (Cramer’s Show) airs after the market closes, I have used the opening price of the next day for my calculations. (I.e If Cramer makes a recommendation on Thursday night, I use Friday opening price as the base for my calculations)

All the data used in the calculations are shared at the end.

https://preview.redd.it/yc7i0we0fo981.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb1c59f7bb5c02119e674ffaaf079fa67afa6120

**Results**

https://preview.redd.it/5ezb3bw1fo981.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fb146c04d7e9311751be085f6d21348fafac092

1-day performance of Cramer’s recommendations is excellent! On average, the Buy and Positive mention stocks went up by 0.03 and 0.05% respectively, and sell and negative mention stocks went down by 0.1 and 0.02%.

Another interesting fact is that ***you would not have lost money*** if you followed Cramer’s Buy recommendations. Across the time periods, his Buy recommendations have on average netted you positive returns \[6\]!

His sell recommendations did not pan out so well. Even though they dropped in price the next day, over the next week and month, they returned inline or even better than his buy recommendations!

Given that there is a counter-intuitive trend in the returns, let’s calculate the accuracy of his calls.

https://preview.redd.it/rht12ux2fo981.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&s=c571f5fc7d63fcb095555080320757192129d380

Here I am assigning a call as correct based on price change. If he gives a buy recommendation, I expect the price to go up and vice versa. As we can see from the chart above, his recommendations only do slightly better than a coin-toss. Even this only holds for short-term and buy recommendations with long-term sell recommendation performance dropping below 50% \[7\].

While this narrow edge over the 50% mark can be used by algo-traders who have the ability to trade a large amount of stocks, if you are an average investor listening in on a Cramer show and hear about a stock recommendation, you might as well toss a coin to see if you should invest or not!

Finally, it’s time we pit **Cramer against the market**. Do his recommendations beat the market?

https://preview.redd.it/5fszhew3fo981.png?width=1020&format=png&auto=webp&s=1cf5e2c992435a6d8ed36dbed707b11dd4cd30ba

Oh yeah! I was as surprised with the results as you are. I ran the numbers again and then one more time but got the exact same result! Cramer’s Buy recommendations beat the S&P 500 by a factor of 10 for the **one-day time frame**. But, if you held the stocks for anytime longer, you would have underperformed the market significantly.

Before you go daytrade on his recommendations you should know that the numbers we are seeing here are heavily influenced by outliers. If you miss out on the top 1% of recommendations (\~110 stocks out of the 11,000+ buy recommendations he had made), your **1-day return would be -0.062% instead of +0.034** \[8\].

https://preview.redd.it/1xtamkf0fo981.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6b9215c2379524644653c67ff375667c8f0354a

**Limitations of the analysis**

The analysis has some limitations that you should be aware of before trying to replicate the strategy.

1. As the astute among you might have noticed, if you sum up all the stocks used in the analysis it would only come to 18.5k. I removed \~15% of the overall recommendations as either they did not have stock data present in Yahoo Finance/Alpha Vantage or the price data did not match with the one given on the Mad Money website.
2. The data is obtained from the Mad Money website itself. I haven’t manually verified if the calls recorded on the website are in fact an accurate representation of the calls made by Cramer in his show. The below statement is given in their description and I am taking them on their word.

>We are impartial in our recording and simply log exactly what was said. We do not interpret the calls. If a call is vague or in question we simply won't list it.

https://preview.redd.it/11nzh3f0fo981.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=a15a32e373431bc460ce4c082a94ee58e7c392a6

**Conclusion**

No matter the public opinion on Cramer, we can generate excellent 1-day returns following his buy recommendations (even beating the market in doing so!). Whether it’s due to his superior stock picking ability or whether it’s simply due to self-fulfilling prophecy \[9\] (as he has a wide audience who will act on his advice) is yet to be known.

I would bet on the latter as, if the extraordinary one-day returns were in fact due to his superior stock-picking ability, the returns should have held over longer time periods, and also his sell recommendations would not have ended up performing better than his buy recommendations as we are observing here.

It only makes sense to listen to his advice if you are a day-trader or an algo-trader who is trading a large variety of stocks over short periods of time. For everyone else, just sticking to the S&P 500 would give you better returns over the long run!

**Footnotes and existing research**

**\[1\]** For those who don’t know, Cramer makes his picks in a CNBC show called [Mad Money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Money). Cramer himself defines the show as something which should be used for speculative/high-risk investing and not for your retirement portfolio.

**\[2\]** For comparison purposes, an equity research analyst [covers only 10-25 companies](https://whatforwork.com/jobs/equity-research-analyst-sell-side/).

**\[3\]** It’s not in an easily usable format. I had to parse the data from the webpage using Python (Beautiful Soup) - I have shared all the data used in this analysis as an Excel and Rows file at the end.

**\[4\]** I did not calculate for Hold as he only made 27 hold recommendations, which is lower than what is required for a statistical significance.

**\[5\]** In my [last post about Jim Cramer](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mtehdq/i_analyzed_all_700_buy_and_sell_recommendations/), there was a lot of controversy around how I calculated the time period. So here is the detailed version about how the time period is considered. For One-Day returns, we are considering that we will purchase the stock the next trading day after the market opens and then sells it at the end of the trading day. For weekly and monthly returns, I am using adjusted closing price since across a week or month there can be stock splits as well as dividends.

**\[6\]** This can also be attributed to the market rally we have experienced over the last 5 years where a large majority of stocks went up.

**\[7\]** 50% benchmark might be controversial with a lot of you (I agree given that if we are in a bull market there is more than a 50-50 chance of a stock going up tomorrow) → My rationale here is standing today looking at a stock, there are only two things that can happen tomorrow. It can either go up or go down. I assign equal probability to both given anything can happen tomorrow. The market can turn bearish, positive or negative news about the company can come up, etc. If you have a better logic for a benchmark, please do suggest!

**\[8\]** But to be fair to Cramer, this is applicable to all types of Investment strategies and hedge funds! The performance of a few of the stocks in your portfolio will finally end up heavily influencing the returns of your overall portfolio. → Think of Tesla incase of ARK and FAANG in case of S&P 500.

**\[9\]** There is some [existing research](https://scholarship.tricolib.brynmawr.edu/handle/10066/588) that deep dives into this topic.

**\[10\]** Since it’s a live tracker using data from Alpha Vantage, the calculation is done slightly differently than in the analysis (in the live tracker I had to use the closing price on the day of recommendation instead of the opening price of the next day). I will be updating it to follow the same process as the analysis as soon as I get info from Alpha Vantage.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rvuzw8/should_you_listen_to_jim_cramer_i_analyzed_20000/,nobjos,2022-01-04 18:58:39,4190,wallstreetbets

>‎I think that despite having some rough edges here and there, Deathloop could be considered another great work of Arkane Studios, one that has undoubtedly remained for posterity and that I am sure, will reach that degree of cult of the Dishonored and Prey. Who would you recommend this title to? Well, basically if you are a fan of the work of this company, I would tell you that this new proposal has to be within your priorities yes or yes, I am sure you will love it. In the same way and as always when I have the opportunity to talk about Arkane's work, I would tell you to give it a chance as soon as possible, because with Deathloop, we are talking about another of the great jewels of contemporary video game design thanks to its very fine design and shape.‎

>Arkane Studios has truly become one of the handful of studios that when they put their name on a product, we know it is going to deliver on all accounts and Deathloop is not only great at all the things it wanted to do but it is also a very powerful contender for the Game of the Year trophies, an absolute masterclass in video game development.

>If you thought Groundhog Day would have been even more awesome with guns and assassinations or that Dishonored would have been a better game if only Quentin Tarantino had directed it, you’d probably enjoy Deathloop. Despite some issues with pacing, bugs, AI, and mechanical clarity, Deathloop is smart, funny, intricately designed, and driven by engaging action, cool puzzles, and relative freedom to approach its objectives in various ways. Deathloop is an addictive and rewarding shooter and one of the most ambitious action games this year.

>Deathloop is the newest hit from Arkane Studios and even if it feels very familiar to Dishonored at the beginning, the gameplay loop changes everything. The studio captivates players again with a strong level design and the day and night cycle gets even more out of the different environments. In short, with Deathloop in your hands you'll experience the best the studio has delivered so far and leaves little to be desired.

>DEATHLOOP is a cathartic blend of stealth, gunplay and powers that culminate in a satisfying gameplay loop as you explore the eccentric island of Blackreef. Whilst the narrative payoffs don’t always live up to the intriguing premise, there’s an undeniable sense of style and substance that help carry the game into really favourable territory. Knowledge really is power in DEATHLOOP and there’s a pleasurable novelty to much of the game’s design that allows it to feel engaging even when the player’s hand is held a little too tightly. Even within a year of time loop releases, DEATHLOOP stands out as its own unique beast worth experiencing.

>Deathloop feels like Arkane Studios threw on a chef’s hat, mixed Dishonored, Hitman, and Deus Ex in a pot, added a pinch of ’60s flair, two cups of badassery. Although I didn’t think I’d be too hungry, I came back for second and thirds. Deathloop is unabashedly an Arkane Studios game and while it's not without its rough edges, this outing is one of the most creative experiences I’ve played in recent memory.

>With an intriguing story and compelling gameplay, Deathloop is one of the most original and gripping games to come out in the past few years. One of the best parts of Deathloop is after you solve one mystery, often several more take their place, requiring you to keep digging.

>Deathloop is genuinely refreshing in how different it is. It took me a while to get used to not saving, and being more daring in my battles against the Eternalists, most of which ended successfully and only occasionally ended with me being shot to pieces. The world is fascinating and the way you gradually learn new tidbits of information each loop means that even if you are killed prematurely, you still feel you have meaningfully progressed. Each zone has loads of secrets to uncover and will respond to Colt’s actions in different ways, meaning that mastering the maps and their layouts is crucial to fully upgrading Colt’s weaponry and hopefully bringing about a final end to the time loop. Deathloop is a brave change of direction for Arkane, and one which I think is overall extremely successful. It might not be an immersive sim, but it’s still a hell of a fine game.

>Deathloop is an original, visionary and courageous work, a playful experiment that returns to reiterate the indisputable talent of the Arkane Studios team, which over the years has never stopped putting itself to the test with ever new challenges, often in line with the commercial logic of the triple A market. The result of the studio's latest creative bet is a brilliant game design exercise, at the base of a ludonarrative construct as multifaceted as it is compelling, blessed by an absolutely majestic artistic direction. Deathloop is a one-of-a-kind game, which unfortunately is torn from excellence by some rather important flaws.

>Consistency is the mother of mastery. And DEATHLOOP is another consistent release of Arkane Studios. For newcomers this game can serve as a great entry point to the Arkane portfolio.

>Deathloop is seriously slick. It’s a game that entrusts its players to engage with its systems in their own way, and while you’ll never at be a loss on what to do, you won’t have your hand held, either. It’s fast, it’s smooth, it’s a hell of a lot of fun. I almost don’t want the loop to end, quite frankly.

Satisfying action, world-building that's second-to-none, style and substance, and a genuinely enthralling riddle at the centre, Deathloop delivers it all.

>Also, again, it’s just so damn fun to play. And I think for a developer whose games have always been so clever and innovative to behold but not necessarily entertaining without a fair dose of punishment along the way, that’s hugely important. Deathloop is still signature Arkane in terms of exemplary immersive-sim design, reminiscent of BioShock and Dishonored, but it also puts a giant smile on your face each and every time you play. Quite whether that’s enough to see it succeed at a mainstream level remains to be seen, but there’s no doubt it’s another stellar title on the resume of an esteemed studio. It might even be its best.

>Deathloop, summarized, is ""Arkane does Hitman."" It glorifies its repetition, and never feels unrewarding, especially when taking down a player-controlled Juliana. I want to re-immerse myself in its world, pick apart its secrets, and master its systems. Not everything works seamlessly, but taken as a whole it's an immersive sim sandbox of unmatched proportions.

I think it's clear why RK is getting the heat he has and they're so afraid - his options aren't properly hedged by market makers and he knew they wouldn't be. This is his Kansas City Shuffle.,"It should be clear by now that RK has been a busy boy over the last 3 years. He now has cash on hand equal to his total portfolio in April 2021, and Sunday morning the total value was nearly 7 times that, a large chunk of it shares that represent a 525% increase over his holdings at that time.

The following is complete speculation on my part, so take this with a roll of tinfoil.

[Unlike Andrew Left, I don't think he's in this position because he's been staked](https://de.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/gamestopguru-enttarnt-das-dreckige-geheimnis-von-roaring-kitty---citron-research-2633848), I think it's because he's been meticulously following this stock and market trends over the last  3 years, finding the patterns that allow him to parlay his options volatility arbitrage strategies into additional shares and more dry powder to rinse and repeat the process with. I have absolutely no doubt that he was the whale making [the huge options moves in late April and early May that largely flew under the radar](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1cljvxe/hole_fucking_shit_somebody_stacked_options_on_30/).

His return to the scene, the week of meme tweets that undoubtedly took months to plan and craft, is no doubt because he saw the perfect combination of factors if given the right spark. A conjunction that would create a positive feedback loop that would be impossible to stop without another systemic fraud like during the 2021 Sneeze.  The May 17th options expiry was his test run, June 21st would be [the Requel.](https://x.com/theroaringkitty/status/1790457051115847720?s=46&t=MAFseI99JuRV7oVZxXMhCg)

From [the moment he liked the Run Lola Run tweet](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1cx2a2k/run_lola_run_the_bet_on_20/), every move was planned out or already completed, we just had to look for the signs, and not get lost in the gambit he was setting up, because he had already identified a series of moves that would be utterly predictable responses to his actions.

So he starts with the two massive $20 call buys on 5/20. To put this in perspective, he created more open interest than typically exists in half a dozen strikes when you look 3 or 4 weeks out. Check out the June 28 and July 5 open interest from now for a comparison.

[11,785 open interest for 7 strikes in 3 weeks](https://preview.redd.it/n8bhgnvhsm4d1.png?width=272&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac80f9548126b77940113851062a7b7a9eefc5e7)

[2.072 open interest for 7 strikes in 4 weeks](https://preview.redd.it/01ydccur2r4d1.png?width=276&format=png&auto=webp&s=a806befe7a47183cb9193b71ade51799f268eb6d)

What happened after those call options were written is what should happen if they can't be paired with opposing bets from other market participants - the Market Maker takes on the risk temporarily and hedges based on the delta of the options. The Market Makers actually have to buy these shares in the lit market, because IOUs are only good for us plebian household investors and retirement accounts.

[Understandably, we saw a jump in the stock price moments after those option buys hit the tape.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1d0k9tw/need_some_wrinkles_to_help_understand_more_nuance/)

[Sweet, found a screenshot from one of my previous posts](https://preview.redd.it/he4wkjqlvm4d1.png?width=1033&format=png&auto=webp&s=38abfcfbbfaf38e159021f478a0af2b064916504)

We also saw the option price run up appropriately due to the volatility increase and the stock price increase.

[Except, the next day, when 4 more of those 5,000 contract buys occurred... not much happened.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1cxh59m/three_more_5000_contract_orders_near_eod_on_june/)

# Did they turn off the hedging algorithms?

# Did DFV know they would do that based on his observations over the last few years of option buying?

# And did DFV wait for a time when his war chest and market conditions would mean that he lay the ultimate bear trap for the biggest boss possible, the fucking Market Maker, because he's got every confidence they're nakedly selling options because they can normally manipulate the price to make the options worthless?

It's a classic Rope-a-Dope, or [Kansas City Shuffle ](https://x.com/theroaringkitty/status/1791106334517010680?s=46&t=fLU0CV7toR_NjhvzNuoWOA)as all the hip cats are calling it.

So after he sees the algos are off, Wednesday rolls around, and he starts his counter-punching. THIRTEEN 5,000 option sales occur. And despite the fact those should have been hedged, significantly moving the price and creating more volatility on the options chain, it was a big fat nothingburger as far as the trading price went for most of the day, with enough concentrated sell volume towards the end of the day to undo the price action of the previous 6 hours.

But on Thursday, nothing. They might have felt whatever was happening was over, so they cautiously turned the algos back on. So when the Friday orders hit at the end of the day...

Boom, price discovery. And then of course the after-hours news of the GME stock sale being completed.

This was difficult to chart since I don't have the best data scraping sources, but I was able to pull 10 minute sales data for the dates coinciding with the buys and tried to overlay that information with stock volume and the 20C options buys (I ignored the 25C and 30C buys that occurred in the same date range, but there were only a handful.)

Does that look like a stock price moving with actual hedging of open options interest and rising delta? These calls were all ATM with the exception of the buys on 5/24, when the stock was in the low $18 range.

As to why RK revealed his positions on June 2nd - I'm wondering if his hand was forced but it was an inevitability he was anticipating. He was nearing an ownership stake that would require disclosure, and I bet E\*Trade/Morgan Stanley had begun internally sweating the issue over the holiday weekend, which is why word of them looking into kicking him off the platform came out so quickly after he dropped his YOLO return.

This could all be some circulation-blocking tinfoil on my part, this is not financial advice, I am not a cat, let alone a stock market expert, but if I'm right, hopefully your seat belt is buckled and your tray is in the upright and locked position, because [DFV has pulled an Ozymandias](https://i.imgur.com/ZSdnmwx.jpeg).

A refresher on what the $#@! is going on with GME,"A lot of you may be new here, or maybe you've been here for a long time.

But either way, I'd like to bet that aside from knowing that ""hedge funds and shorters got too greedy and we're going to get them for it!"", **you don't really have any idea how the GME rocket started.**

So let me do the honours of giving you all a quick run-down on what is currently happening with GME.

# It all started when hedge funds and shorters shorted GME into oblivion.

With COVID-19 impacting the world the way it did, GameStop was set to become the next Blockbuster and go out of business for good.

Hedge funds, who love to make money off shorting companies into bankruptcy, saw this as a perfect opportunity to make some easy money by **shorting more shares of GameStop than there were actual GameStop shares.**

While some were able to figure this out before anyone else, pointing this out would have meant nothing if there was no reason for GME to go up...

# Then all of a sudden GME had reasons to go up.

People like Michael Burry and Keith ""Roaring Kitty"" Gill pointed out that the fundamentals for GME at the time (mid-2020) were not reflected accurately in GME's current price ($3-4 USD). What Michael Burry found out, in particular, was that not a single GameStop was in the red; they were all making profit to some degree.

After GME starting showing positive trends, people like Ryan Cohen and companies like Microsoft invested in the company as well. With these investors in the company, there was hope for GameStop to not go bankrupt and actually adapt with the rise of eCommerce.

Finally, to really help GME go along, Microsoft and Sony announced that their latest consoles (the XBOX One X and PS5) were still going to support physical disc copies of games. This further gave reason to believe that full-digital wasn't the future just yet, and that there was still hope and profit to be had in physical products/locations.

# And as GME started going up to most people's surprise, people started noticing how screwed shorters suddenly were...

But before we continue, I need to briefly explain what a *""short squeeze""* and *""gamma squeeze""* is. **If you already know, you can skip below.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**A ""short squeeze"" is when lots of people ""short"" shares, yet the price of the stock they shorted continues to go up, and eventually they're forced to cover their positions.**

**This allows those with shares to sell the shares back to them at ridiculously high prices because, well, they have to buy them back.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**A ""gamma squeeze"" happens when many people make lots of  ""call"" options with market makers for prices that are very high to reach (ex. a $100 call for a stock worth $10).**

**They do this in hopes that not only will the stock attain that set price or higher, but more importantly that the market makers don't actually have the shares to give to them if/when the call options can be exercised.**

**If this high volume of ""call"" options does get exercised, and market makers don't have the shares for them, that means that they'll be forced to buy the shares. Those with shares can then make them buy these required shares at much higher prices.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# SKIP POINT

**People online began to communicate with one another about GME, and pointed out that is was going up despite what shorters wanted to happen.**

# It was then that they theorized that with all the shares being shorted, and with the stock continuing to go up, that they could buy lots of GME shares and create many highly priced call options to create a short squeeze as well as numerous gamma squeezes.

# But they weren't going to accomplish this alone...

**Other big players on Wall Street also saw what GME was capable of, and provided the high volume required to send GME to the moon. And they provided the high volume indeed...**

# And thus began the GME Gamma Squeeze of January 2021

What was once a $3-4/share company destined for bankruptcy suddenly sky-rocketed to a max of $480+ essentially overnight, and shorters and bears suddenly found themselves in billions worth of losses.

# But we all know that big guys don't play nice.

Before more call options could be filled and the price of GME could go up any further, numerous brokers halted buying GME all together. This gave plenty of time for numerous ""call"" options to become worthless, and for shorters to regroup and recover their losses.

After all, the DTCC gives a 21 day grace period for investors in huge debt to cover their positions, so these shorters were going to do everything they could within these 21 days to get the price of GME back down. This way, they could not only minimize their losses, but even get back into the green and continue to bankrupt GameStop.

In less than a month, GME plummeted to $40/share, and all seemed lost. Hedge funds would win once again, and retail traders were given a grim reminder that they don't play by the same rules as the big players...

# Yet this is not how GME ends.

Just a few weeks ago, more hope was given that GME would rocket once again.

Keith ""Roaring Kitty"" Gill proved that not only did he still hold all his original shares in GME, he also doubled down on his position right after he announced that he would still buy GME during a Congress Hearing.

During the same Congress Hearing, Melvin Capital (a hedge fund that lost 53% of its value because of the GME Gamma Squeeze) admitted that there was no short squeeze, and that the rise of GME to $400+ was a result of a gamma squeeze.

**In other words, a ""short squeeze"" hasn't happened yet.**

People found that shorts theoretically didn't all cover as shorters continued to be greedy and likely held on to their shorts as they thought they could still bankrupt GME like they originally planned.

They found that while short interest was seemingly much lower that there were still very few GME shares left to short and that shorters were still losing millions every time GME spiked to new level highs.

Not only that, but that shorters likely continued to short as GME went down during the gamma squeeze; putting them in an even bigger short position than the last.

Ryan Cohen made it official that he would be heading GameStop's eCommerce division (because of course he is)...

There were meme tweets of ice cream, frogs, and 1980-90's games/movies...

People began exercising call options once more, and now...

# The GME rocket rises once again...

# TL;DR: Shorters and Market Makers are currently in desperate positions where they need A LOT of shares of GME to cover their shorts and fulfill their ""call"" options, and retail investors (but most importantly big players) are buying and holding all the shares they can to make GME the Big Squeeze of the 21st Century.

# NONE OF THIS IS FINANCIAL ADVICE, AND PURELY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES. I JUST LIKE THE STOCK.

The company's leadership team said they will do everything to make sure their employees are treated right. Almost every single one of them came into this company, after retiring from UPS with all wonderful benefits, that the Union got for them after 25 yrs of service. None would be where they are now, if it weren't for the Union. As a former Union member & leader, this breaks my heart.

""You did it!

Several weeks ago, many of our drivers bonded together and signed a petition stating they no longer wanted to be represented by IBEW Local 1430. Then, on April 11, one brave driver filed a petition with the NLRB asking for an election. The Company then worked with the NLRB to protect our drivers' rights to vote in a secret ballot election. Before the election, our drivers spent a lot of time getting the facts to understand their rights before making this important decision. 

Last Friday, May 3, the NLRB held a secret-ballot election in our test kitchen. 105 drivers voted and, by a vote of 72 to 33, our drivers voted against union representation. Our drivers decided to put their trust in the Company and our leaders instead of continuing to pay dues to Local 1430 as their representative. Our drivers are now union-free - and you no longer have to pay union dues. 

While we are proud of our drivers for learning the facts and making an informed decision that continuing to have Local 1430 represent them is not in their best interests. It is now time to put your full trust in our Company and leadership team - we will not let you down. 

In the coming weeks and months, managers and leaders will continue working closely with you and working hard to create and execute on a plan of action to earn your trust and address your concerns. 

For those 72 drivers who voted NO, thank you for your vote of confidence in our company and leadership team. That says a lot about our relationships. To those 33 drivers who voted to remain involved with Local 1430, we will do our best to earn back your trust. Please know we are all one team and need to focus on how we can keep improving our culture and operations together. 

We are committed not only to listening and taking action, on the feedback from our drivers, and also reigniting the [redacted] culture and values in a way that resonates with our drivers. We highly value our drivers for their talents, skills, and tenure that they bring to work every day. ""

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Makes me wonder how effective union leadership may have been.
> 
>> **Commenter 2:** Honestly it's likely more of an indication of how dumb and gullible your average truck driver is. I used to have to interact with these people for work and it's insane that we entrust these people with massive machines.
>> 
>> For some odd reason HVAC and truck driving seems to attract just the bottom of the barrel dipshit. Seems to be the trend on reddit too, you see a brain dead far right conservative take it's going to be someone who's also active on trucker subreddits half the time.
>>> **Commenter 3:** A TON of union workers listen to anti-union conservative propaganda and think they'll be better off without the union. I'm in a major union plant and you see Trump and Let's Go Brandon gear everywhere.
>>> 
>>> These people permeate the membership rolls, committees, and leadership positions. Our unions are under threat from within. Our local union FB page is a stream of conservative content or replies.
>>>> 
>>>> **OOP:** OMG, this is so true. I was a Union VP for over 10 yrs and a member for over 17. He's already looking for other work.

**Commenter 1:** Putting your trust in your employer is some top tier foolishness
> **Commenter 2:** The OP says that almost every driver at this company are retired UPS drivers. Probably the 72 that decided to leave the union... they already have full Teamsters benefits & pension, so fuck everyone else! They don't want to pay union dues because their pension & paycheck aren't enough..
> 
> Just another case of the senior members screwing the younger members.
>> 
>> **OOP:** Not drivers, the management team is made up of retired UPS drivers (25 yr tenure) who have their full benefits and healthcare. They brainwashed alot of the immigrant drivers to vote the Union out. They'd speak to them in their respective languages and literally just have them nodding their heads.

**Commenter:** You know it would be real shame if 33 drivers went out and found new jobs. I'm gonna bet a nickle that the other 72 get the old you gotta do the extra shifts for no OT. We are family.

> **OOP:** Oh, that is definitely happening. Hubby has 2 interviews already lined up this week.

[Update](https://new.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1eu1a8k/update_my_husbands_job_convinced_their_truck/): **August 16, 2024**

I said it from the beginning. They were going to start letting people go for BS reasons and hire people at lower wages.

My husband who voted against the companies interest was let go today. They can now terminate you at will. The reason for letting him go you may ask. Complaining about the working conditions since they got rid of the Union.

**Edit: Since I guess maybe I didn’t write it correctly, my husband who is Pro Union voted against the company asking to remove the Union. He voted “against the best interest of the company”. If you read my previous post, you’ll see the company letter they sent when they asked truckers to “trust them”.

**Additional Information from OOP**

> **OOP:** Let me explain. When the drivers voted, the results were literally divided by old employees to new hire. The company knew who had voted to retain the Union. My husband is friends with the former steward, who’s also a driver. The guys were having a lot of route, scheduling and other problems.
> 
> Yeah, once or twice or maybe thrice, they lamented loudly they missed the Union due to the lack of support they now had from the company. All of those guys have been slowly let go: We lost a route (lie) You’re not keeping up like we need you too, while giving the employees extra customers and complaining when they don’t get back to base early enough. Not Qualified any longer? No pints, DUI or tickets???? Yeah BS but that’s NYC

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter:** Hope he can find a union shop for his next job.

> **OOP:** I’m on it!! I’m a Union girl all the way.

**Commenter:** If they actually gave that as a reason, there might be a case for wrongful termination, expecially if the working conditions were in violation of any law.

Also, due to that, he might be eligable for unemployment.

> **OOP:** They didn’t say that directly to him. They’re dumb, but not that dumb. But everyone knew. They started getting rid of the drivers that were making a lot of OT. They had restaurants on routes that only wanted the experienced drivers as they didn’t have to watch what they did or put things. They went in & usually had to help the inexperienced drivers with theirs. Literally they have maybe 10 drivers that have been there longer than my husband now. The company employs over 150 at this location. Now most of the new guys are leaving as soon as they see how hard it is. It’s a revolving door of employees now. He can collect but it’ll never be the same as his take home was, plus the medical benefits we just now lost.

**Commenter:** So, they voted to dissolve the thing that gave them collective bargaining power to willfully submit to the employer's arbitrary whims? And they fell for that?

> **OOP:** Yup. The letter they gave my husband when the vote passed is up on my previous post. He worked hard with the steward and the longer employed drivers, but the new hires were like “more money in my check”. 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18zn172/my_32f_fiance_33m_of_8_years_refuses_to_have_a/) - **January 5, 2024** 

My (32f) fiance (33M) does not want a wedding of any kind. No elopement, no ceremony, no rings exchange, no vows, nothing. I've always wanted a traditional medium sized wedding but I've compromised to doing an elopement with just my parents present. He refused. So I compromised again and said let's just do the paperwork like he wants then go to dinner with the four of us and celebrate. He refused. Then I said okay let's just do the paperwork and dinner with the two of us and then get some pictures of the two of us and maybe do a party or something with family a few months from now. He refused. I just want to make it special, it's important to me and I've expressed that to him and he will not compromise on anything. We've been together for 8 years so it's not as if we don't know each other well. I am really starting to rethink getting married and even staying in this relationship, but he says I'm ""being bratty"". Am I putting too much importance on this? Anyone else just do paperwork and call it a day and not regret it?

Edit to add: He just wants to do paperwork and make it legal. He doesn't want a ceremony or fanfare of any kind. He doesn't have family he wants to invite and I'm very close to my family and want to have them at something. He also wants to focus on saving money and not spending it on a wedding.

Also, thank you for all of the time everyone has taken to leave thoughtful replies to this post. It's really helping me reflect on the situation and I appreciate the responses.

**RELEVANT COMMENTS**

**trilliumsummer:** How much did you push for him to get engaged? Cuz my spidey sense is that he wasn't so willingly going down on one knee.

My bet? He doesn't want to get married. He caved to the engagement and now bashing the wedding is his latest way to delay and push it off.

>**OOP:** I really didn't push, we've been living together for 7 years and he just showed up in the kitchen one afternoon with an engagement ring. I was like, ok. I do also think you're right that he doesn't really want to get married on some level. The thing I'm confused about is I was very slow to schedule anything because I'd rather delay it than give in to something I don't want to do. But he asked me daily to schedule an appointment to do the paperwork. Why not just leave it alone and wait for me to initiate everything? I wouldn't have even scheduled the paperwork if he didn't keep pushing me because I wanted to plan an elopement.

**n2oc10h12c8h10n402:** OP, after reading your post, I have a feeling he doesn't even want to make it legal. You offered him many options. What's the problem with signing the papers and having dinner with your parents? Is that an inconvenience to him?

> **OOP:** He doesn't want to spend the money and thinks I'm too ""dependent"" on my parents. I see them for holidays and talk to them on the phone weekly. He isn't close to his family so he thinks I shouldn't be


**its_ash_14:** He doesnt wana get married. My guess is you were talking about getting engaged, to “shut you up” he proposed. I wana know the details of how you got engaged. Did he half-ass it? Put effort in? Ect.

> **OOP:** It was 100% half assed. But for some context, he does have mental health issues and doing big things tend to be overwhelming, which I get and that's why I don't generally expect a lot. We don't go on dates, we don't do much at all to be honest, but that's the place he's at right now. He got a ring from a family member and gave it to me in the kitchen and said ""wanna get married"". I also didn't push him to get married, but I am wondering now if he asked because he felt like he should


**HoshiJones:** Is he considerate of you in other ways? Or is he generally as dismissive of your feelings as he is about this?

If it's just a quirk, and he's a wonderful and caring man otherwise, then just let it go, I guess.

But it seems doubtful that a man who exhibits such a complete lack of regard for your wants and feelings in this will be a good partner. Only you can know that, and I've seen you carefully not answer any questions about that.

>**OOP:** It's, kind of complicated. He has some mental health issues he's been dealing with since before I met him. He doesn't want a ceremony because he has no family he wants to invite and he doesn't want to spend the money. Which I understand, but I think he's going too far in the opposite direction. If he can't have his way no one can, and again, I am wondering if I should see this as a red flag. I do overlook times when he doesn't show up for me. And these comments/questions are making me reflect on those and I'm seeing a trend. They are things that I thought were upsetting at the time but decided to move on from because they're little. Like not taking me to the hospital when I was sick, not giving me a ride when my car broke down, not going to my graduation, things like that. I take him to everything and even drove him an hour away to a doctors appointment after I worked. But, I show love through acts of service and support, and he thinks financial support and spending time with him is love. I'm wondering if we are just incompatible and this is the first real big life decision we've tried to make together

**Quite_Successful:** Is he the same for every celebration? He never has a birthday party or goes to dinner to celebrate his birthday?

>**OOP:** No, which is another reason why I'm wondering if I'm making this too much of a big deal. He doesn't celebrate anything. I always get him a cake, make his favorite dinner, and wrap a gift for his birthday, but he really doesn't ever ask to do anything or mark it in any way. Mine either, he usually just asks me what I want to do for the day, and I buy myself a gift. He's not a big thrills kind of guy. Which I've never minded, except this one thing. Maybe I'm asking for something he really isn't capable of doing

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/191e1hj/update_my_32f_fiance_33m_of_8_years_refuses_to/) - **January 8, 2024** 

After reading through the comments and reflecting I had another conversation with him. He agreed to have dinner with the two of us and take a couple photos but only if he could buy himself a new computer. That was much more insulting to me than anything before, especially because he claimed his reason for not agreeing to anything is mostly because of money.

I think most of the comments were correct in that he never really wanted to get married. I called everything off, canceled our appointment to do paperwork and returned the ring we bought. I'll have to deal with telling my coworkers but I guess I'll google how to tell people without going into too much detail.

I am leaving him. I have ignored a lot of stuff with him because we are financially stable together, comfortable and he was my first and only relationship, so I think I just wanted to make it work and didn't really know what was normal and what I've learned to tolerate.

**RELEVANT COMMENTS**

**nutbrownale:** Who allows ring returns? Also you said in the first post he didn't want rings to save money. Something is off.

>**OOP:** We bought our wedding rings through financing and he gave me a family engagement ring. I gave them both back to him.

**RevolutionaryTea8722:** I’m sorry OP but you did the right thing for you. How did he take the news?

>**OOP** Initially he was really angry and talking about how I get everything because I got two rings, the date I wanted, photos and dinner and he doesn't get anything out of getting married, that it's all for me. Then he calmed down and said he wants to get married because I'm his best friend and he loves me. I'm probably going to go to a friend's house or my parents today because the last time we ""broke up"" (I ended up going back) he told me to pack and that he would get rid of my stuff if I didn't.

There is an endless supply of stock pickers out there and Jim Cramer is arguably the most famous one! So, it’s only fair that we put his stock picks to the test.

### Jack of all trades

An equity research analyst usually covers at most 10-15 companies annually and issues directional calls every quarter. But, Cramer has made an incredible 21,653 stock picks \[1\] over the past 7 years averaging close to 3,000 calls per year. He was making more than 20 stock picks per episode of his show. We can clearly see the classic bullish bias on the calls made by Cramer with 74% of the picks in the buy/positive mention.

One concerning behavior exhibited by Cramer is how frequently he changes his mind. Consider the case of Netflix. He ended 2021 by stating Netflix is a buy but then changed his tune after just a month. Once again in March, he said that it was a buy and then changed it to a sell rating just 2 weeks later. Consistently following his calls would be a nightmare for even the most seasoned stock trader!

https://preview.redd.it/kpkk3v7gngba1.png?width=444&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdd57b04acc06b064eb8471eb08b951179f2710c

Since Cramer frequently contradicts his own picks, we are only evaluating the short-term performance *(up to a month)* of his calls \[3\]. 

### Cramer’s Performance

Surprisingly, if you had followed Cramer’s picks to the T, you would not have lost money. On average his buy recommendations went up by 0.87% after a month and his sell recommendations went down by 0.15%. One possible explanation for the brief outperformance is that Cramer’s Mad Money has more than 200K viewers – even if 1% decide to act on his stock tip, it’s big enough to move small stocks. This phenomenon is well-studied and is known as the [Cramer Bounce](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cramerbounce.asp).

&#x200B;

>*In January 2009, graduate students from the University of Pennsylvania published a study claiming that over time, the average* ***next-day increase*** *for a stock that Cramer recommended was* ***3% for the entire study sample****, and almost* ***7% for smaller cap stocks.****They proved through the use of electronic communication networks (ECN) that most trades came in after 7 p.m. ET, when ""Mad Money"" concluded.*

https://preview.redd.it/2amdlsbsngba1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=49e9804a5ad74dd1fc29a9e512addfb570b8a706

While his standalone performance looks good, it’s a completely different story if you pit him against the market (S&P 500). Except for the 1-day buy recommendations, you would have **gotten a better return just investing in the market every single time.** Another fascinating insight is that his performance worsens as we increase the time horizon \[4\]. 

https://preview.redd.it/8dmossmyngba1.png?width=958&format=png&auto=webp&s=88310aba5e6bdcc0833f31d143ccec3c9cfc7cd0

Finally, we all know how easy it is to pick winners in a bull market \[5\] and next to impossible to do the same in a bear market. There was so much money flowing in the system that [monkeys and goldfish were beating the market](https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/the-monkeys-that-beat-the-market) and we were trading [images of rocks](https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/nft) for actual houses. But, the party came to an end in 2022 with the Fed raising their interest rates at the fastest pace in recent history. **So how did Cramer perform in 2022 \[6\]?**

All his buy and positive mentions lost money across all time periods! His buy recommendations on average went down 3% in just one month and positive mentions were down 5%. To add salt to the wound, if you had invested in the market instead of Cramer’s calls, you would have scraped by with a \~1% return!

### The best & worst calls by Cramer

Even a monkey throwing darts at a chart will be able to pick some successful plays. Cramer has made more than 20K calls and some are bound to work out incredibly well. Here are the top 5 best buy and sell calls made by Cramer. Two of the picks that stand out are the buy rating given to Moderna during the vaccine rally in Jul ’21 and the sell call for the Norwegian Cruise line just before they closed the cruise ships due to Covid. He timed both of them to perfection – We’ve got to give credit where credit is due!

https://preview.redd.it/vgwc86a5pgba1.png?width=1109&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b4b4a77a3482918265e039ae978c9427b17bc4d

On the other side of the coin, Cramer issued a buy rating to EPR properties & Toll Brothers just before the Covid crash. Both stocks tanked more than 70% in just over a month. During the same time, his worst sell recommendations (Sunrun and Novovax) ended up doubling in just under a month!

https://preview.redd.it/hv4zpf7qogba1.png?width=1279&format=png&auto=webp&s=146799c1358f1c45ea012c568b91310b8406a7ee

His picks were so bad that there are now [accounts that track his calls](https://twitter.com/CramerTracker) and even an [Inverse Cramer ETF](https://www.wealthmanagement.com/etfs/fund-helped-investors-bet-against-cathie-wood-taking-jim-cramer#:~:text=The%20Inverse%20Cramer%20ETF%20would,appearances%2C%20according%20to%20the%20filing.) that aims to provide investment results by doing the opposite of Cramer’s investment advice.

### Heads I win, tails you lose

>*Show me the incentive and I’ll show you the outcome:* ***Charlie Munger***

In the end, we believe that all of us give undue importance to stock-picking influencers – We should all see Cramer for what he is – an entertainer. He does not care about the performance of his stock picks because that’s not how he makes his money. He makes his living by entertaining his audience week after week. His only job is to have a strong opinion – and he does that well.

The final nail in the coffin is how Cramer’s own portfolio has performed. He claimed to have a ""*rate of return of 24% after all fees for 15 years*"" for his hedge fund until he retired, but his performance was [never independently verified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Cramer). For the portfolio for which the performance was publicly available, researchers at [Wharton found](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/568f03c8841abaff89043b9d/t/5734f6e2c2ea51b32cf53885/1463088868550/HartleyOlson2016+Jim+Cramer+Charitable+Trust+Performance+and+Factor+Attribution.pdf) that

I guess that just about sums up everything I had to say!

But, the sample size of 1,456 picks that he made in 2022 should be more than enough to give the analysis statistical significance.

God of War Ragnarok is Santa Monica Studios’ way of raising the bar, creating a new challenge for themselves on how they will manage to top this one in their next outing. It is easily one of the best games of 2022 and quite possibly one of the best franchise sequels of all time, taking its rightful place in the gallery of legends.*|PS5|

It beautifully doubles down on everything that made the previous game good, and adds just-enough new content to keep gamers from feeling like everything is a repetitive slog. Characters and story are the clear winners here, with gameplay and level design following on from the previous title in a comfortable and natural way. The way the writers at Santa Monica Studio have implemented narrative for absolutely everything in the game seems magical and unlike any other video game to release since Mass Effect. Furthermore, the way in which traversal has been upgraded feels like a significant addition; truly changes the way the game feels. Locales are open and vast, and visually stunning, while brand-new animations, level design, and beautiful special effects showcase the graphical fidelity of the game spectacularly. God of War Ragnarok is an experience unlike any other, and is truly an exceptional video game.*|PS5|

Combat is furious and intense, exploring every nook and cranny of each Norse realm is captivating, and clever puzzles are seamlessly intertwined with abilities that change, evolve, and make you feel like a master of all crafts. Narratively, the heartfelt and fascinating story is supported by incredible writing that makes its whole cast of characters shine, and the production values are through the roof, with a gorgeous soundtrack and visuals that push the limits and stun at every turn. Santa Monica Studios have again managed to create something truly memorable and entirely special.*|PS5|

New tools and greater enemy variety elevate combat, and the expanded environments and cast give this sequel the epic scope its story demands. But the beating heart of the game remains its characters, and Ragnarök delivers an immensely satisfying next chapter for just about everyone-Kratos and Atreus, returning friends, and new faces alike.*|PS5|

The bold changes that Santa Monica Studio made in the 2018 God of War semi-reboot paid off, and this sequel is a full realization of what that game started. Like Atreus and his own coming-of-age, it’s clear that the studio approached Ragnarok with a greater sense of confidence, reflected in the game's characters and the story circling them throughout the nine realms.*|PS5|

Refined to the highest degree, every hour you spend with Kratos, Atreus, and the memorable characters of Ragnarok feels fulfilling – whether it be journeying across the Nordic realms with your companions, taking in the beautiful sights and enjoying idle chit chat, overcoming the odds in invigorating and varied melee combat encounters, or sharing in the deeply emotional connection between incredibly strong and nuanced characters.*|PS5|

God of War Ragnarök continues the endearing journey of father and son in a grand spectacular finale of the Norse Saga. This is the game of the generation.*|PS5|

Yet, just like how it did four years ago, the final product blew our expectations out of the water, a divine experience that marries storytelling, gameplay, and presentation as flawlessly as it could. Descending upon the PlayStation audience like nectar of the gods, God of War Ragnarok is a game that truly deserves its place as one of gaming’s greatest achievements, and a legendary addition to the pantheon of best games ever made.*|PS5|

It tells one of the best stories in video games, one that will have you run the gamut of emotions while playing through it. Fighting the enemies of the realms feels a lot like the previous game, but there's enough new and refined elements to help it stand on its own.*|PS5|

It's better than good; it’s a downright masterpiece. I know that word get's thrown around everywhere, and a lot, but I genuinely mean it. The story is beyond anything I would have imagined, and by the time I finished watching every line of credit roll, I couldn't help but give everyone a standing ovation. Like the first game, God of War Ragnarök will forever be etched in my memory as a timeless experience. A remarkable, unforgettable journey that I’ll keep talking about for the years to come and probably for the rest of my life. I could not be more confident in saying this, but I’ve found my Game of the Year for 2022.*|PS5|
|[**Next Gen Base**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/364/next-gen-base) \- [Ben Ward](https://opencritic.com/critic/2308/ben-ward)|100 \~ [10 / 10](https://www.nextgenbase.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-review)|*Following up a masterpiece with another masterpiece is a rare thing. But with God of War Ragnarok, Santa Monica Studio have achieved it. An absolute triumph of game design, technical knowhow and storytelling – Ragnarok is here. And it’s destroyed everything in its path.*|PS5|
|[**PSX Brasil**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/514/psx-brasil) \- [Ivan Nikolai Barkow Castilho](https://opencritic.com/critic/3863/ivan-nikolai-barkow-castilho) \- *Portuguese*|100 \~ [100 / 100](https://psxbrasil.com.br/analise/god-of-war-ragnarok-review/)|*God of War: Ragnarok is a natural evolution of the 2018 title, featuring an excellent story, an amazing technical side, new gameplay features, incredible battles and lots of varied content to explore. Easily a game of the year contender, Kratos and Atreus' new adventure is unforgettable and satisfyingly concludes this chapter of the Norse mythology.*|PS5|
|[**Play Watch Read**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/831/play-watch-read) \- [Sylvano Witte](https://opencritic.com/critic/8825/sylvano-witte) \- *Dutch*|100 \~ [10 / 10](https://www.playwatchread.nl/play/god-of-war-ragnarok/)|*God of War Ragnarök picks up where God of War left off in 2018. Kratos has trained Atreus in three years to battle the Norse gods. A great adventure awaits you as a player and you will enjoy every minute of it. Are you just playing for the story? Then you will enjoy it intensely. Want more than just the story? Then you will spend at least forty hours exploring everything and you will absolutely not be disappointed. God of War Ragnarök is the best you must have played this fall. To conclude with Kratos his words: Mhn.*|PS5|
|[**PlayStation Universe**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/39/playstation-universe) \- [John-Paul Jones](https://opencritic.com/critic/843/john-paul-jones)|100 \~ [10 / 10](https://www.psu.com/reviews/god-of-war-raganrok-review-ps5/)|*God of War: Ragnarok is the perfect sequel. A carefully iterative offering that beautifully maintains the essence of 2018's Game of the Year while making meaningful improvements to augment its already stellar combat and progression systems, God of War: Ragnarok is a meaty and deeply emotional epic that effortlessly secures its place as one of the best games on PS5 and a sure-fire Game of the Year candidate.*|PS5|
|[**Push Square**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/25/push-square) \- [Robert Ramsey](https://opencritic.com/critic/932/robert-ramsey)|100 \~ [10 / 10](https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/god-of-war-ragnarok)|*God of War Ragnarok is phenomenal. Even amongst PlayStation Studios' typically stellar output it's a showpiece - a masterfully crafted game that smashes expectations at almost every turn. The sheer, often ridiculous scope of Ragnarok makes 2018's God of War feel like a prologue - and that's perhaps the highest praise we can bestow upon a sequel.*|PS5|
|[**Siliconera**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/793/siliconera) \- [Aidan O'Brien](https://opencritic.com/critic/8649/aidan-obrien)|100 \~ [10 / 10](https://www.siliconera.com/review-god-of-war-ragnarok-builds-on-kratos-and-atreus-dynamic/)|Kratos and Atreus set off on yet another great adventure. This time the stakes manage to be even higher, and we get to watch both characters continue to develop into some of the most interesting and well-written figures in gaming.|PS5|
|[**Sirus Gaming**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/409/sirus-gaming) \- [Carri Grant Raffy Abenoja](https://opencritic.com/critic/4776/carri-grant-raffy-abenoja)|100 \~ [10 / 10](https://sirusgaming.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-review/)|*God of War Ragnarok is a masterpiece in all aspects and is a very strong contender for the Game of the Year 2022 title. The buildups towards the climax felt like the end of a very long, but satisfyingly attractive, tunnel. It’s definitely one of the games on my list I wish to play again for the first time.*|PS5|
|[**The Beta Network**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/844/the-beta-network) \- [Samuel Incze](https://opencritic.com/critic/8929/samuel-incze)|100 \~ [10 / 10](https://thebetanetwork.net/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-review/)|*God of War Ragnarok is a perfect example of how a video game sequel should be done. Featuring a narrative that faithfully continues the story from 2018’s reboot, Ragnarok has many surprises hidden away in its stunning realms. Each realm looks breath-taking and takes full advantage of the PS5’s hardware. The gameplay is exactly what you would expect, with various touch ups and upgrades to make this feel like a true next gen experience. If you own a PS5, this belongs on your shelf!*|PS5|
|[**The Independent**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/852/the-independent) \- [Jasper Pickering](https://opencritic.com/critic/5469/jasper-pickering)|100 \~ [5 / 5](https://www.independent.co.uk/indybest/gadgets-tech/video-games-consoles/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-b2216691.html)|*After the dust has settled and the credits have rolled, God of War Ragnarok is as strong a continuation as anyone could have hoped for, and a fitting end to Kratos’s latest chapter. Few game loops have been as engaging to experiment with and ultimately master than Kratos’s own brutality, but by adding new dimensions to an already intoxicating equation, the game successfully manages to deliver on the high expectations its predecessor laid bare at the altar. On its own merits, it’s difficult to fault but on the foundations of 2018’s God of War, it’s nothing short of a masterpiece.*|PS5|
|[**TrustedReviews**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/326/trustedreviews) \- [Ryan Jones](https://opencritic.com/critic/6159/ryan-jones)|100 \~ [5 / 5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/god-of-war-ragnarok)|*God of War Ragnarök is a spectacular sequel, retaining the same ultra-satisfying combat as its predecessor, but with a more grandiose story to boot.*|PS5|
|[**Twinfinite**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/21/twinfinite) \- [Chris Jecks](https://opencritic.com/critic/92/chris-jecks)|100 \~ [5 / 5](https://twinfinite.net/2022/11/god-of-war-ragnarok-review/)|*God of War Ragnarok is the epitome of cinematic gaming experiences.*|PS5|

It's vital in a way few releases are. With captivating performances that carry an amazing story to a jaw-dropping final act, it’s a game that achieves everything it sets out to do to the absolute highest standard.*|PS5|

This gripping adventure about a father and son trying to do what is right keeps hooked throughout while putting you through the wringer both in its gameplay and emotional storytelling. Ragnarok builds on 2018 in every aspect cementing it as a masterpiece in gaming.*|PS5|
|[**Game Informer**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/35/game-informer) \- [Kyle Hilliard](https://opencritic.com/critic/1040/kyle-hilliard)|95 \~ [9.5 / 10](https://www.gameinformer.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok/next-to-godliness)|*God of War Ragnarök feels a lot like God of War (2018), which is a compliment considering how fantastic that game is. Sony Santa Monica was right to not break what wasn’t broken and it has expertly continued the story threads that were left hanging from the previous game.*|PS5|
|[**GameByte**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/672/gamebyte) \- [Olly Smith](https://opencritic.com/critic/3213/olly-smith)|95 \~ [9.5 / 10](https://www.gamebyte.com/reviews/god-of-war-ragnarok/)|*The longer story and expanded worlds give way for characters to develop in meaningful ways, making the whole game feel very much like a sequel worthy of its predecessor.*|PS5|

Santa Monica Studio has successfully taken everything that was great about the last game and amplified it while correcting just about every problem area and then some. There are slight stumbles, but it's a constantly surprising, epic adventure that shows genuine growth in its characters, backed up by best-in-class combat and a menagerie of breathtaking scenes. This makes Ragnarök an easy GOTY contender and one of the best games I've played in years.*|PS5|
|[**SECTOR.sk**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/615/sector-sk) \- [Matúš Štrba](https://opencritic.com/critic/5090/mat-trba) \- *Slovak*|95 \~ [9.5 / 10](https://www.sector.sk/recenzia/38375/god-of-war-ragnarok.htm)|*God of War Ragnar'k is one of the best games of the year, and it's a game you'll remember for a long time. It will appeal to you with well-written characters, fun action gameplay and audiovisual presentation. Only annoying bugs can spoil this great gaming experience.*|PS5|

The gameplay is an enhanced version of the 2018 chapter and has the merit of offering interesting variations for many, many hours to keep the player's attention.*|PS5|

I probably laughed and got misty-eyed more times in the first few hours of playing this than I did for the whole first game. Plenty of heavy themes are tackled here other than life and death: alcoholism, abusive relationships, codependency, depression, emotional breakthroughs, true father-and-son bonding, manipulation, etc. You could call this game God of War: Families, Amirite? I've deliberately been vague about many of the key plot points, funny exchanges and gut-punch moments because I think people need to experience them for themselves. I probably already said too much regarding the bears, but they left an impact. The rest of God of War: Ragnarok will make quite an impression as well, and perhaps provide lessons that can outlive us all.*|PS5|

Though it’s still a very, very good saga. One worthy of the Edda.*|PS5|

God of War II may not have changed much mechanically, but it made nuanced improvements to gameplay, story and level design, all while injecting much-needed variety into the enemies and environments.*|PS5|

And perhaps even get a new PlayStation console to see it in its 60fps high-res majesty.*|PS5|

God of War Ragnarok left me speechless; it’s such a beautiful game both visually and narratively. The team has somehow managed to take what made the original such a wonder and expand upon it, delivering to players a masterpiece, an experience that sits atop the God of War pantheon.*|PS5|

This journey comes out swinging and never lets up. Even during its subtle moments, you'll be captivated one way or another by the characters, the scenery, and the level of quality that only a handful of creators can accomplish. The folks at Santa Monica Studio are true masters of their art, and I can’t recommend God of War Ragnarok enough.*|PS5|

Unlike the well coordinated experience as a whole like last time, everything in Ragnarok seems to act like soulless puppets attached to a series of strings. Although the reskinned aspect of a working formula seems to be the safest bet, if we were to find any sort of effort of evolution since the prior title, it wouldn’t feel as lackluster from a highly anticipated title to make its grand entrance. This one feels rather like a quickly brewed DLC of the previous title instead.*|PS5|

# The mod team

Guys I want to thank each and every member of this sub, we put a lot of trust in you guys by letting this entire sub be self governing and decide for themselves what is good info and what is BS.

The only thing some people seem to overlook is that I am not the ""main mod"" or anything like that, this is a group effort.

Know that with the upcoming hype and everything that's happening we will see a huge influx of bots, shills or people who just want to spread FUD, remember to always take a step back, vet their sources and come to your own conclusions.

Never take anyone's word for fact, even mine, double check everything and everyone.

Also take in mind that there are companies out there who do ""shit talking' for their work, or as someone had linked me an example of someone who used to do this work:

# New rules imposed by DTCC signed this weekend.

well it seems someone is scared some people wont be able to pay up.

Credit goes to [u/LongTermTendieLoser](https://www.reddit.com/u/LongTermTendieLoser/) for initially finding this and bringing it to the boards attention.

The DTCC just posted this over the weekend

[https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rule-filings/2021/NSCC/SR-NSCC-2021-801.pdf](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rule-filings/2021/NSCC/SR-NSCC-2021-801.pdf)

So just to get back to some basics, as I'm sure we will be seeing a lot of new members in the coming days.

# What Is the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC)?

The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) is an American financial services company founded in 1999 that provides clearing and settlement services for the financial markets. When the DTCC was established in 1999, it combined the functions of the Depository Trust Company (DTC) and the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC).1﻿ The NSCC is currently a subsidiary of the DTCC

If you want more info on this I'd say check out this website:

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dtcc.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dtcc.asp)

I'd like to thank [u/neversell69](https://www.reddit.com/u/neversell69/) for doing a great writeup which boils this down to it's basic points.

Things found in these pages:

**(page 22):**

As described above, the proposal would strengthen NSCC’s ability to maintain sufficient liquidity to complete end-of-day settlement in the event of the default of a Member. a member like for example, Melvin and Citadel.

The proposal would do this;

by allowing NSCC to calculate and collect, when applicable, SLD every Business Day from those Members that pose the largest liquidity exposures to NSCC on that day.

The proposal would also include a mechanism to allow NSCC to collect SLD on an intraday basis, including on the first Business Day of the Options Expiration Activity Period, when liquidity exposures are historically higher.

**(page 41):**

The Corporation may require any such Member to deposit additional amounts to the Clearing Fund pursuant to Rule 15.

Rule 15 basically says the members can't be fucking idiots and if they are wilding out the NSCC can protect themselves by demanding more money to reduce their risk

**(page 88/89):**

(iv) increased Clearing Fund deposits (including additional amounts required in respect of trade activity received by the Corporation after calculation of the applicable Required Fund Deposit);

(v) additional payments to the Corporation in such amounts as may be determined by the Corporation each morning reflecting a percentage of up to 100 percent of the participant’s (i) average amount of total daily net debit positions or (ii) morning gross debit activity;

What's a net debit position? Here's the fucking Investopedia summary because I know your too lazy to Google it:

    If the income collected from all options sold results in a lower money value  than the cost of all options purchased, the result is a net debit to the account, hence the name debit spread. If shit gets really fucked the DTCC can ask for a supplemental liquidity deposit (SLD), which basically means when the market is fucked and the member is looking at a fat options loss the dtcc can make them pay an extra fee to make sure  they can cover the loss  

**(page 52):**

Overview. The Corporation requires sufficient liquidity to enable it to effect the settlement of its payment obligations as a central counterparty. The two principal sources of liquidity for the Corporation currently are deposits to the Clearing Fund and a committed line of credit. A substantial proportion of the liquidity needed by the Corporation is attributable to the exposure presented to the Corporation by its Members who would generate the largest settlement debits during options expiration activity periods in stressed market conditions. In order to ensure that the Corporation has sufficient liquidity to meet its payment obligations, it is appropriate that such Members provide additional liquidity to the Corporation in the form of supplemental liquidity deposits to the Clearing Fund.

The new rule changes basically means the DTCC can now calculate this **'fat loss fee'** everyday and even during the day and force a payment.

So the DTCC is covering their ass and are going to liquidate the member themselves when shit hits the fan.

aka the DTCC will fucking crucify Citadel/melvin and other Short sellers the day this pops off, and if it does, they will be forced by them to cover all at once. and remember it's not just us retailers, it's also other sharks swimming with us who smell a golden opportunity to take out the competition all at once.

What does this mean? it means that the DTCC is covering their own ass, it means they can force the whales who are itm to buy, they can force people who's short contracts are up to pay up and buy back in.

for the noobs: see this as a Patch being installed, they're correcting the PVP combat because someone was OP and they just now got Nerfed.

I've said it before but the new head for the SEC is someone I actually respect, he was at the helm when the 08 crash happened and he took action to make a hefty legislation against this ever happen again.

Gary Gensler, he passed the *Dodd*\-*Frank* Act, giving regulations to swaps (the thing caused the crash) which until he came along where not regulated at all!

Also with Senator Elizabeth Warren wanting a investigation into the GME saga.

These two combined are already making waves right now, so stop asking IF or When the Squeeze will happen, know that we are on the right side of history and this shit is going to get FUCKING wild.

# New FUD tactics

lots of people are suddenly asking ""who will pay"" and ""what if melvin/shitadel goes bankrupt""

IDC, just like when I'm selling my car I dont care where the money comes from, all I care about is the cash in hand at the end of the day. how the buyer get's the money is not something I worry about nor care about.

google how the market works, and see why I don't care.

GameStop Corp has tapped shareholder Ryan Cohen to lead a shift towards e-commerce, Bloomberg reported on Monday, sending the company’s shares up 10.3% before the bell.

Cohen’s RC Ventures activist firm reached a settlement with GameStop in January, giving Cohen seats on the company’s board.

# Media Blackout.

As some more astute apes have seen yesterday(03-08).... no news on GME?

ok that's weird, they've been saying GmE B@d for weeks now, now its in the green... \*Crickets\*

What makes this more funny is that Jimmy Cramer has gone full blackout, this dude was having multiple tantrums on twitter per day and bitching about GME on ""mad money"" the entire time.

But now it seems that Jim Cramer's show ""mod money"" wont be on this week, and his twitter has gone black, this in combination with nobody else reporting on the entire thing makes me believe we may be facing a media blackout, this in order to make sure that not more people buy in.

Word of mouth is one of the most valuable things right now.

yesterdays news, nothing on GME?

# Now is the time to gain control of your emotions.

Seriously I get it 200 is an awesome number, less then 2 weeks ago we where at 40, but if your goal is 100.000 K then 200 a share is nothing.

Adjust your expectations and adjust your way of looking at big numbers, because if you hold like a lot of people said, then it will take some days before it gets to 100k , and if you don't adjust your baseline then you will fold early.

10.000 sounds like a lot right? but if I told you you could get a salary of 100.000k its nothing.

100.000 sounds like a lot, but compared to 500.000 its a lowball offer.

ITS OK TO BE GREEDY! but be patient.

Trust the other apes, they have held for a long time (over a month) and they didn't fold.

So trust them now when you are winning.

Great post about managing behavior with these type of things, I honestly think it's a good read for everyone in GME

# If this break $xxx dollars I'll do ....nothing!

Because I'll be holding to 100k minimum.

if I look at the graph it tells me the last spike was $347 (nasdaq) just to give you an idea we are just a 100 bucks or so away from that RIGHT NOW.

folding at a $1000 is still paperhanding in my book but that's just me, I'll be holding for 100 times that.

because this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and I don't think we will ever see a situation like this ever again. especially with the new DTCC rules that are coming in.

Adjust your baseline and expectancy, adjust your view to see big numbers and see where the nice tendyman will bring you.

Because soon will the Tendyman come to take our rocket into the sun <3

Also some decent explanation of the new DTCC rules:

yes I know the guy looks like a tool and a douchebag but his explanation to my understanding is not bad.

# 

# Gme going 10k-50k-100k-500k

Ok so I heard a lot of talk about ""if it go's to 100k it will ruin the economy"".

No it may ruin the stock market for a hot minute but not the economy.

why you ask? easy the Economy is not the stock market or vice versa.

first of all 'ruin the economy' is, and always has been, a dogwhistle for rich people losing their superyachts, how many times was the ""economy"" ruined and the people on wall-street went on with business as usual?

the thing is, once we get our gains and we pay the taxes the economy is back up.Due to the gains being put back into the economy right away (paying off debts, mortgages, bills in general) the economy will be healthier then ever, also we'll most likely see a lot of people start their own charity or business or something along the way.

which also stimulates the economy further.

So when they cry on tv saying ""they're ruining the economy"" no jackass we are doing the same thing to you that you did to all of us for years. the economy wont crash, the economy will flourish as people will for once be able to pay their bills, for once they'll be able to LIVE instead of EXIST to work from paycheck to paycheck.

&#x200B;

# My expectations.

I think by looking at all the data I have available in front of me

    https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME 
    https://gme.crazyawesomecompany.com/ 
    https://finviz.com/map.ashx?t=sec 
    https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/gme/?p=gme&guccounter=1 

I believe that they have one last ditch effort, they're going to let it rise to close to 1k (be it 500/750 or 800 or 1000) and then drop it down. just in an effort to get most of us to paperhand.

[u/OurLordOfWar](https://www.reddit.com/user/OurLordOfWar/) did a write up [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m1n88r/they_will_more_than_likely_short_gme_at_1k/)

But let me surmise;

    They will let it rise. $500? $800? $1000?  
    And as their last resource. 
    They will make it drop RIGHT THERE and start with the media saying, that was it. 
    That was the squeeze.  
    The shills will spread FUD  The shills will post gains that are tempting to the eye. 
    Making you want to do the same.  
    They will sooth your smooth brain with false words and false DD.  
    They might go as far as closing all subreddits to cut communication and cause panic.  
    An animal that is cornered and about to die will fight with everything they got.  

Now I hope with this you understand why we put in the ""posting age requirement"" and banned ""gain and loss porn"".

This is something we could see coming a mile away, but this time let's be smarten then them.

# PSA: NEW SHILL TACTIC IS TO ANNOUNCE WHOLESOME/CHARITY DEEDS ALONG WITH A LOW GME PRICE TAG LIKE 1K OR 10K

[u/slash\_sin\_](https://www.reddit.com/user/slash_sin_/) did a writeup on this and seems dead on with it.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m1f0cy/psa\_new\_shill\_tactic\_is\_to\_announce/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m1f0cy/psa_new_shill_tactic_is_to_announce/)

Lot's of people saying ""oh but I will donate to ST. Jude childrens hospital.

Sounds awesome right? well if you're in the UK you know that ST. Jude is one of the most overfunded childrens hospitals in Europe. they have multiple charity drives each year, which includes a comedy show they have yearly on tv to get donations.

So whenever you hear ""my donations will go to ST. Jude"" be weary.

Also when you see a lowball number (yes I believe 1 and 10 k are low in this situation) then be extra vigilant. why you may ask easy.

This is a psychological trick, a cognitive bias called “price anchoring” described by researchers Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman if you’ve ever read the book Thinking Fast Thinking Slow.

“Anchoring or focalism is a cognitive bias where an individual depends too heavily on an initial piece of information offered to make subsequent judgments during decision making. Once the value of this anchor is set, all future negotiations, arguments, estimates, etc. are discussed in relation to the anchor.”

Often a tactic used in pricing goods or negotiation.

Classical conditioning sets you in a specific mindset, like pavlov had with the dogs. you hear a bell and you start salivating because you know hey it's food time.

Same go's if someone says hey 1k is the goal over and over, you start to believe that.

So from this point on if someone posts a low ball 1/10k ""My GaIn$ wIlL Go To X when 1/10k"" I'll just delete these threads because they're bullshit, 1k is the minimum this stock was thought to do by both Ryan Cohen and RC Ventures and Domo Capital.

**1K IS NOT A SQUEEZE!**

thanks to [u/ellosee](https://www.reddit.com/u/ellosee/) for pointing out the ""price Anchoring""

One thing to note, people can of course donate to anywhere and St. Jude does do amazing things for kids, as you can see this weekend on r/wallstreetbets people have been donating in small amounts to a gorilla foundation, this is not bad because of a very fine outliner.  
They didn't sell their gme to do so, none of those posts even talk about gains or such, you don't see a dollar amount they're donating all they are showing is they helped a sanctuary.

Don't over focus on what they're doing, expect fuckery, but keep your eye on the prize people.

focus on your moon, on all that heavenly glory, and let it bring you calm that we have slowly but surely been gaining momentum once more.

These guys will run out of money at some point, if the DTCC rule kicks in and they're still in this they are most likely fucked. as the DTCC can say ""pay up bitch"" and they're done within a week.

Don't expect the HF who oppose us to give up, they'll fight you to their very last breath however they can. but know we are currently at the time of writing on 242 euro that's $288 USD. again going up massively. we may be moving slow, but we are moving.

Why do I have so much respect for this motherfucker?

for one his head is brighter than my future, second do you know who made laws so hedgies can't pull the same trick they did in 2008? this motherfucker.

He made the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, this law basically said oh you did what? swaps? these fucking things aren't regulated? one sec fam I got you.

And this guy spat in the face of everyone and just went and legislated this shit so hard that you probably haven't heard about swaps in a long time. he is known for giving zero fucks and doing what he thinks is right. not what the corporations think, no what HE thinks is morally right.

Please please PLEASE guys, chill about the 19th or any other dates, this will come whenever the fuck it's here, and you'll know trust me.

Do not set hard dates, it will happen when it happens. We don't know for sure when the squeeze will be here, what will set it off or around what specific dates.

Remember this is a public forum and anyone can view this, so expect Melvin/citadel to have at least a few people browsing this.

Therefore do not think March 19th is a SET date, dates hold no value, the squeeze does.

So be level headed and expect fuckery, if everyone says the 19th (or any date) is the date you'll only be setting yourself up for disappointment, let this happen naturally. this is part of mentally preparing you.

# GME is up 441% since 2/24

So because I've been seeing a lot of shill posts yesterday and have not used the delete button this hard since mom found my ""Homework"" folder.

Lets look at some basic facts.

Did the dip change anything? are we still on?

Guys nothing changed, we had a dip we have had red days since the 27/18th of January and we had it for weeks. One dip doesn't change anything in my book.

look at the 24th of feb, this is less than 2 weeks ago and we went from 40 to 250, this is still up A LOT!

So guys chill the fuck out, I get it, this is exciting and scary at the same time but we are still going up, but don't expect stocks to be all green every day. we can and will have red days.

For example if this go's up 10k and closes on 9.2k it will be a red day, does that mean it was all for nothing? no it means the stocks have reacted to something.

So step away from the emotions you may have when looking at this and take a step back, look at the bigger picture and take a breather.

Because I've seen a lot of negativity on the subs since yesterday, which is to be expected.

Red day forecast is shilly, in the low 90 degrees and slightly overcast.

As much as we would love to see it, we're not gonna see gains of 30-40% every day. It's costing the hedgies millions each day in short interest, all we've gotta do to keep fucking them is to keep getting the sweet dip and holding.

 

https://preview.redd.it/t4ts8yd8fzm61.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=d79404918ee5729f58acc1d8ce4c68398ccd00aa

See something familiar?

This is why I keep spouting on about ""everyone should educate themselves"" the more you know the less panic you will face.

all thanks go's to [u/atrivell](https://www.reddit.com/u/atrivell/) for posting it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m2wjp8/gme_is_doing_what_its_been_doing_all_week_i_am/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

so if you look at the MACD ( **moving average convergence**/**divergence**, is a trading indicator used in technical analysis of stock prices)

as he stated:

    We've seen this action that's happening today A LOT,   
    we just haven't had people who bought at $348.50 complaining before.   
    Support lines are trending up, FASTER than last week,   
    and we have seen this buy and sell off many times in the past   
    few days when everyone was a diamond hands beast.   
    this is a simple analysis of the chart and not financial advice.  

so what does that tell us?

The support going up faster is a good indicator that you'll get a more upwards trend.

The faster that go's the higher it can go, but wtf do I know?

even Yahoo is posting about this

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/we-should-see-the-gme-short-squeeze-continuing-s-3-partners-174542296.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/we-should-see-the-gme-short-squeeze-continuing-s-3-partners-174542296.html)

the most important take away is at the end:

    “This has not been a profitable trading week for GME short sellers,   
    after being down -$1.36 billion on Monday and Tuesday,” Dusaniwsky said.   
    “[Wednesday’s] +7% price move added another -$202 million in additional   
    mark-to-market losses.”   
    All in, GameStop shorts have now lost $6.8 billion year-to-date,  Dusaniwsky said.

# Such a hard Stimmy right now

Ok so people where talking about this yesterday so I thought I'd include it.

The stimulus checks will be hitting from this weekend on, just imagine what this could do, imagine what the fuck is going to happen if thousands of apes yolo their stimmy in GME... fuck guys we wouldn't need a catalyst we'd be our own haha.

But again not investment advice, Just saying this would be the funniest shit I'd see in my life if this happened

There is a letter to the board.

Ok so yesterday I was in a stream and this got brought to my attention : [https://www.stockholdersrights.com/](https://www.stockholdersrights.com/)

Their main interest is to present this on monday to the board of GME, this to do an audit of shareholders, meaning checking the shares, checking everything that's going on with the shares and to make sure the synthetic/naked shares are tracked down so something can be done against it.

So please I ask everyone to quickly sign it and make sure the board get's this on monday

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m49zch1mfzm61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1c898da3241597def50d25f040951a456a149d9

 

Not sure who originally posted this but thank you!

This is exactly why you'll see red days before this is implemented.

Remember everything happens for a reason, red days, people spreading FUD or disinformation. we have seen this for weeks, no one folded then, no one has folded now.

again trust your fellow apes and see where this ends up.

And just to make sure because I've seen some other people saying ""Oh BuT ReNs0Le DoEsNt BeLiEve in X aMoUnt"" trust me that's the fastest way to get banned from this sub.

I believe this can hit 100,000.00 a share, you can call me an idiot for believing, you can call me a moron for having high hopes, but NEVER try to tell me or other people what they ""really"" believe""

&#x200B;

Again the best advice I can give you retarded apes is when you go into this to be logical, don't let your emotions rule you, rule your emotions.

Also if you worry if this will go up or not, look at the fundamentals of the company, look how they turned around their company, look at who got brought in.

I personally think if the company is sub 1000 USD it is undervalued, again you can disagree but show me proof.

And remember none of this is financial advice, just a retards opinion.

&#x200B;

Also guys, it's weekend go outside and don't hang on the sub.

No news here in the weekend, nothing changes only shills throwing around fake/bad DD and FUD.

So best way to fight that, don't be here in the weekend.

The doctors told her that she has to stop drinking any soda and carbonated beverages before she can have the surgery (and then after of course).*

*And for those accusing me of enabling my mother by doing some of the grocery shopping: She's my MOM. She raised me. Overall raised me really well. She will ALWAYS (unless she no longer has her wits about her) be seen as the ""authority"" to me. I'm not going to purposefully start refusing to buy items she asks me to get and gives me the money for. My parents (my dad's involved here as well) allowed me to move in rent free after college and losing my job. The least I can do for them is buy the things they tell me to buy. I've done my part in trying to educate her to make better choices, but I'm not going to start trying to control the food she buys. I'm her child; she isn't mine. I also mentioned she DOES her own shopping too, just short trips. You can buy ice cream and cigarettes in under 10 minutes. Most of the junk food is stuff she buys herself.*

*But again, thank you to everyone who reached out with kindness! I really appreciate it. <3*

**My Mom.**

My mother is suffering from a hernia that the doctors can't fix because her morbid obesity makes it too dangerous to perform the surgery necessary to fix it. Everytime she moves too hard or fast, she has to worry that the hernia will get worse again. She's had two ER visits due to said hernia in the past couple of months so the doctors can at least help to relieve the pain and make it better for the short term by sort of working it back into place. Each of those times, if they weren't able to put the metaphorical bandage over it, I don't know what would have happened. She could have died. She could still die. 

My mother is huge. Bordering on 500 pounds if she isn't there already. She's on so many daily medications. Genuinely, it's like she carries a pharmacy with her. Some are for her diabetes, I don't even know what the others are for. Her diabetes is fully weight-related. 

She can barely walk around the store when she has to go shopping and avoids having to get groceries at all costs. I do most of her errands for her that involve walking more then 5+ minutes. 

She drinks 8+ cans of diet coke a day. She smokes half a pack of cigarettes a day. Why is this that relevant for a weight loss post? The ONLY way to fix her hernia is for her to lose weight. At her weight, the doctors believe her best bet is a weight loss surgery considering how hard it would be for her to naturally lose weight at this point. She has to stop drinking soda and stop smoking for the surgery that could literally save her life. She hasn't tried to stop doing either. 

She eats a SALAD BOWL filled with cereal each morning. She eats 800-calorie lunches then 800-1000 calorie dinners and ends the day off with ice cream every day. She hasn't even tried to cut back even though she HAS to lose weight for her surgery. I try to help. I try to cook for her, I try to teach her to calorie count, my dad and I broke our backs (metaphorically) to get her a pool running so she could swim to help with weight loss. 

She doesn't care. At all. She doesn't try. She doesn't want to lose weight - that couldn't be more clear. She likes eating and likes being, I hate to say it, lazy. If it wasn't for the hernia, she wouldn't try at all. She has lied to her doctors in front of my face (Covid means a lot of remote visits while I'm in the house). 

She uses her stomach as a shelf to rest her plate on while she eats 1000 calories in one sitting and then makes someone else grab her a soda from the fridge. She throws her finished plate on the floor so the dog can lick it clean so she doesn't have to take it into the kitchen. 

I love my mom. I do. But... I can't keep pretending I love what she's become. I don't respect her like I used to. I just can't. I want her to be better but she doesn't want that for herself. 


**My Sister.**

She at least cares to some extent. She's around 300 pounds. She, like myself, is constantly jumping on the weight loss wagon before falling off again in a week or two. She sleeps all day. ALL day. Yes, she does suffer from depression, and yes, she is on meds and in contact with doctors to help her. But there's still a disconnect somewhere in there because she sleeps 14+ hours a day if she doesn't have to work. When she's not working, she's eating or sleeping. I've talked to her about maybe talking to her doctor about a different medication or dosage but that hasn't gone anywhere. 

She keeps saying she wants to lose weight because she doesn't want to turn out like our mom, but all she does is write down recipes in pretty colors and then never do anything else with them. She wants a salad spinner so she can start making salads, so I asked her why she can't eat salads in the meantime? Apparently she physically cannot make salads without a salad spinner? She WANTS to lose weight, but she doesn't want to do anything required for it. 

She visits most weekends and I try to get her to go on walks with me and she won't. She has a gym membership that she won't use. She KNOWS about calories but just refuses to pay attention to them. 

Because she has specifically expressed wanting to lose weight, I've mentioned to her that surprisingly there are a LOT of calories in butter. I was genuinely surprised when I realized how much there were, so I thought it would help her to know as most meals are paired with buttered bread and that's easily 100-200 calories per meal she could avoid. She told me she doesn't care. Yet she wants to lose weight. 

She's pre-diabetic. She knows she needs to lose weight. She prefers to just talk about losing weight to actually putting work in. 

I love my sister, too. I really do. But I'm terrified of ever being her. And I can feel myself teetering on the edge. It's like I have two paths in front of me. One is the path she and my mom took. One is a path where I overcome my weight. I have one foot planted on the path of my mom and sister and it terrifies me. 

**Me.**

I'm around 250 pounds (I've been too scared to weigh myself recently, I'll talk more about it further down). I'm a 23 year old female and I'm 5 foot tall. I'm DIRECTLY in my sister's shadow and I can feel the ground underneath me pushing me in my mom's path as well. 

I'm a yo-yo dieter for sure. Once, long ago, I did it. I was a healthy weight, maybe had ten pounds left to lose. It was my senior year of high school. I calorie counted and ran (to the best of my out of shape abilities) every morning. It was amazing. 

Then my mother had a cancer scare. Something about those months where we thought she had cancer triggered something in me. I stopped working out and eating right and I just haven't ever been able to go back to it in the same way as before. 

I've suffered with bulimia and binge eating disorder for years. I'm convinced I have a food addiction. I was raised on foods I could make myself so my mom didn't have to cook - ramen and mac and cheese and corn dogs and hot dogs - and have a super limited taste palette as a result. These used to be my excuses as to why I couldn't lose weight. That and growing up fat in a fat family. They're not excuses any more. They're my reasons TO lose weight. I can't let this cycle keep going. 

I will not become my sister. I will not gain that 50-100 pounds that separates us. I will not let myself stop trying like my mom. I won't have a child who I can't be there for because of my weight. My future children will NOT be embarrassed to bring friends home because of how much I weigh. 

My child won't learn disordered eating from me. 

I love myself. I don't love my body right now, but I respect it and it deserves better than this. **I** deserve better than this. I'm done with the yo-yoing. This is it. It HAS to be it. I have so much life left to live that would be held back and shortened by this weight. I won't let that happen.

**Me. V2. Electric Boogaloo.**

I always go in with an all or nothing attitude. EVERY time. I refused to do that this time. That's why I haven't weighted myself yet. 

A couple of weeks ago, I decided to just start walking again. Every morning. Didn't matter if it was 5 minutes or 20. I JUST wanted to develop a habit of walking every day. I use my old favorite running tool (Zombies, Run) to keep me motivated, and for a week that was all I cared about. Walking. With a liiiittle concern about what I eat, but not much. 

Then, the next week, I started to count my calories. My TDEE is around 2500. So I just set my calorie limit to 2000. That way I wasn't going to make a huge shift to my diet at once but I could get back into the habit of counting calories and could relearn how many calories were in the food I ate. 

That's brought me up to today, Sunday. I've successfully walked every single day the past 14 days except for one day. I've been under my 2000 calories every day except for one treat day, which I made sure to keep under that 2500. 

I've successfully said no to fast food offered by my family twice this past week alone. Something I didn't know if I could ever do. 

Saturday I did a test run of intermittent fasting with a slightly smaller fasting period, today I did the whole thing. Tomorrow I start intermittent fasting regularly and the calorie limit drops down and I keep walking. I still don't care how far or how long I walk. I just need to move. 

This time genuinely feels different. I've forced myself not to do it all or nothing and to ease in and easing in has made it so much better. Tomorrow I weigh myself, and for now I'll just weigh once a week. I don't care how much weight I drop each week, not yet. As long as I slowly see a downward trend, I'm doing it right. 

I have so much wisdom to gain from my family. Every day I see them doing the same things I do and I can finally see how much those hurt them, and subsequently hurt me. 

I have to be honest, this post wasn't really just for you. It's so long, I doubt you read the whole thing. It was really for me. I needed to say this and I needed to say it someplace where it feels like it actually means something. 

I hope that this isn't my last post. Accountability is the one thing that has been missing from every diet attempt so far, and I would love to finally have someone other than myself holding me accountable. Even if it's one person who bothers reading this.

I appreciate you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/hub3yr/i_will_not_be_my_mom_i_will_not_be_my_sister/,MossyOakPursuit,2020-07-20 05:05:31,3930,loseit
"I Would Like To Solve the Puzzle - FTD Settlement, Volume Inflation, June 21st, July 19th","Update Post and New Speculated DD

# INTRO

Happy Juneteenth Superstonk.

I am the OP of ""I Would Like To Solve the Puzzle - Roaring Kitty's 2024 Gamestop Play"" and ""I Would Like To Solve the Puzzle - T+3, T+6, T+35"".

I am back with some minor corrections to my initial posts. **Don't worry, if you read my last posts my future date predictions are still the same.**

Many of you have reached out to me directly asking why I have removed my previous posts. I don't want to get into all of the reasons but I do want to clarify for you:

In ""I Would Like To Solve the Puzzle - Roaring Kitty's 2024 Gamestop Play"", **I relied too heavily on my speculated narrative of various memes and tweets to try and create a story that fit GME's price movement.** I realized soon after I made that post that I could have unintentionally caused damage to innocent people who love the stock as much as we do and just love to buy it.

I believe that I and other GME lovers need to be **far more careful** when any public figure is brought into our speculation. After MOASS, the entire U.S. and possibly the world will be looking to us to blame. **We are completely innocent in this fucked up situation and I don't want to give any reason for the righteous fury of future economic victims to be steered towards the GME community.**

That being said, if by coincidence or sheer luck, I believe **I have finally understood why certain price action occurs for our favorite stock.**

I will be re-iterating some portions of my original post for context; however...

**I want this post to be far less focused on meme speculation and more focused on what I call ""FTD Settlement Period Limits"" and how we can use them to accurately predict price movement in the event of great and sudden purchase volume.**

# It's Not Delivery, It's DiGiorno! - Failure to Deliver

**Before Starting**

The T in T+X stands for **Trade Date. It is not to delineate Trading Days.**

The trade date is the date that you submit a purchase and it ""completes"" through your broker.

Anyone who is using C+35 for *any reason*, please **break that habit and start using T+35** when referring to Market Maker/Authorized Participant FTD settlements.

The difference between Calendar Days and Trade Days is related to the specific privilege given only to Market Makers and Authorized Participants. Only these massive institutions are given this exclusive 35 **Calendar** **Day** extension.

**Market Makers must follow the small player's Trade Date limits until they hit those limits. THEN they swap to a calendar day countdown that includes the previous calendar days they have already used up. 35 Calendar days and the pre-market following the 35th day (more on that below) is the absolute limit they can avoid buying shares from specific trade dates.**

**-**

First off, I want to immediately make a correction to my previous post.

In my first post, I relied on the format of T+35+Bank Holidays to explain price movements corresponding with possible large stock purchase dates.

**This format is incorrect. Bank Holidays are considered a normal calendar day. Market Makers/Authorized Participants do not receive extensions for each Bank Holiday.**

**\*Edit\*** The above statement is true; however, in the rare case of a large FTD settlement happening to land directly on a Bank Holiday, that *may* extend the FTD settlement period, or possibly even shorten it by that one day.

My previous thinking was that the entire point of the T+35 exemption time period was intended to allow more possible ""settlement"" days to be available for a Market Maker/Authorized Participant. It seemed counter intuitive for Bank Holidays to remove those possible settlement days. **However, I could not find any documentation confirming Bank Holidays further extend the T+35.** Therefore, I must assume that my previous format is **incorrect.**

So what does this change? Actually, almost nothing. **In fact, this allowed me to finally understand what is going on with this stock.** Let me explain why.

It turns out I missed a crucial factor regarding the T+35 Market Maker/Authorized Participant settlement exemption period:

>*...the participant must close out a fail to deliver for a short sale transaction by no later than* ***the beginning of regular trading hours on the settlement day following the settlement date***\*, referred to as T+4...\*

Source: Rule 204 of Regulation SHO [https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/mrfaqregsho1204.htm](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/mrfaqregsho1204.htm)

In simplified terms, Market Makers and Authorized Participants have until the end of **Pre-Market on the morning following the settlement period limit.** T+3 is the last day of **Regular Trading Hours** that they can purchase; however, they are allowed to instead use **Pre-Market of the following day.** The SEC refers to this special privilege as T+4 even though its really more like T+3 and 1/2 or even less. (Extra note, I swear it feels like the SEC still uses T+3 almost everywhere else when talking about settlement for MMs and APs. I don't know what is up with that.)

**This also applies to their T+35 day limit as the Pre-Market of the next trade day following their 35 days is NOT considered ""regular trading hours.""**

The full **(albeit very simplified)** Market Maker/Authorized Participant's flow chart for a purchase would look like this:

>Purchase order comes into the Market Maker's queue from a Broker

>Market Maker does not buy the share that day

>3 Trading Days pass.

>Market Maker can choose to purchase in Pre-Market of the following Trade Day but decides **not** to. The limit is then pushed to T+6.

>3 more Trading Days pass.

>Market Maker can choose to purchase in Pre-Market on the following Trade Day but decides not to.

>Market Maker now enters T+35 special extension. All of the previous calendar days that have passed since the Trade Date retroactively count towards this 35 calendar day count.

>The 35th calendar day has arrived, the Settlement Period Limit has nearly been reached. The Market Maker REALLY doesn't want to buy that share.

>Market Maker pushes it to the very last moment by NOT purchasing on Calendar day 35. **Instead, they buy during Pre-Market on the next Trading Day.**

\*EDIT\* The flowchart above uses ""Market Maker"" in place of the actual counterparties. In reality, these FTDs are most likely being passed from counterparty to counterparty further up the chain until it lands on the Market Maker's queue after Pre-Market of T+6. Since extending to T+35 seems to be the default behavior for shorting Gamestop through ETFs like XRT, I simplified the flowchart by just inserting the Market Maker.

Let me show you an even more simple example of this flowchart on the *actual* chart. I will only bother using T+35. Why not? That's all the Market Makers seem to use.

The start dates for this period are as follows:

3/28, 4/1, 4/2 all in 2024.

We can calculate the Settlement Period Limit using T+35 and throw in Pre-Market for each date.

5/2-3(Pre-Market), 5/3-4(Pre-Market), 5/7-8(Pre-Market) all in 2024.

[Small Price Settlement Period 3\/28-4\/2 Through To 5\/2-5\/8 \(Pre-Market\)](https://preview.redd.it/ifbbv8yynj7d1.png?width=1896&format=png&auto=webp&s=633d6b9b1e88994af86fecaad804c285671ac179)

The price scale may be small, but the percentage gain is impressive over this 35 day period.

On the left we have an extended downtrend in the price over a multi day period. 35 calendar days later we have a large upward movement. **You might be thinking that the upward movement seems too large for those 3 days of FTDs, but FTDs are only half of the puzzle**. I'll explain the second half in the next section.

For most of us that have trouble with chart analysis it may be difficult to spot normal(ish) price action vs a spike in Naked Shorting that leads to FTD accumulation. For anyone that is interested in looking into the past, I would suggest looking for an extended multi-day period of price dropping. If there is a multi-day *harsh* downtrend on no news/announcements, **there is a higher chance that they are just refusing to complete a large portion of buy orders over those days.**

To wrap this section up, I will leave the entire Rule 204 of Regulation SHO here for you:

>*Rule 204 — Close-out Requirements.* Under Rule 204, participants of a registered clearing agency (as defined in section 3(a)(24) of the Exchange Act) must deliver securities to a registered clearing agency for clearance and settlement on a long or short sale transaction in any equity security by settlement date, or must close out a fail to deliver in any equity security for a long or short sale transaction in that equity security generally by the times described as follows: the participant must close out a fail to deliver for a short sale transaction by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the settlement day following the settlement date, referred to as T+4; if a participant has a fail to deliver that the participant can demonstrate on its books and records resulted from a long sale, or that is attributable to bona-fide market making activities, the participant must close out the fail to deliver by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the third consecutive settlement day following the settlement date, referred to as T+6. In addition, Rule 203(b)(3) of Regulation SHO requires that participants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out fails to deliver in “threshold securities” if the fails to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days. Threshold securities, as defined by Rule 203(c)(6), are generally equity securities with large and persistent fails to deliver.

Source: [https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/mrfaqregsho1204.htm](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/mrfaqregsho1204.htm)

And here is the SECs very poor attempt at an ELI5:

>Rule 204 provides an extended period of time to close out certain failures to deliver. Specifically, if a failure to deliver position results from the sale of a security that a person is deemed to own and that such person intends to deliver as soon as all restrictions on delivery have been removed, the firm has up to 35 calendar days following the trade date to close out the failure to deliver position by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity. Such additional time is warranted and does not undermine the goal of reducing failures to deliver because these are sales of owned securities that cannot be delivered by the settlement date due solely to processing delays outside the seller’s or broker-dealer’s control. Moreover, delivery is required to be made on such sales as soon as all restrictions on delivery have been removed and situations where a person is deemed to own a security are limited to those specified in Rule 200 of Regulation SHO. A common example of a deemed to own security that cannot be delivered by the settlement date is a security subject to the resale restrictions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933.

# Settlers of Catan - Gamma Ramp

In the previous small price example, the price increase after T+35 seemed to far outweigh the price loss from Naked Shorting. Why is that?

It was due to two major factors.

1. **Bull's Entry Point** - Gamestop's stock had experienced a major downtrend over several years. Volume was miniscule as the price had reached an extreme low of near $10 (Post-Split). This, along with several other TA indicators alerted both small and large investors that **Gamestop's stock was at a perfect entry point to buy back in.**

[Close-To-Perfect Entry Point Was The Week of 4\/20\/2024 \(lmao\)](https://preview.redd.it/dy2miajmrj7d1.png?width=1897&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f6f950c9872c3ead790d9e94d0dd4bee872496d)

2. **More Investors = More Options = Gamma Ramp -** Both small and large investors began scooping up call options for absurdly low prices. More open call contracts causes the *potential* for increased options hedging.

But, depending on the strike prices chosen, the price won't drastically rise on it's own. If the price doesn't rise enough, the Options writers won't need to hedge which means a Gamma ramp isn't going to happen on it's own. **It needs a spark to ignite it.**

**That is where the real power of FTDs is on display and this why the Market Makers and Authorized Participants naked shorting Gamestop are in DEEP shit.**

Let's have a look at that first example again but this time let's double check the dates of the Settlement Period Limit.

[5\/1-5\/3 = Wednesday - Friday](https://preview.redd.it/39ly2gfntj7d1.png?width=1896&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b108d060a3aee986467619cd94c8af88af8ca65)

It is my opinion that we are looking at a mini gamma ramp triggered by a higher-than-normal amount of options contracts being pushed Into-The-Money by FTD settlement.

Market Makers are being forced to settle their FTDs leading right into the **end of week options expiration.** Thousands of options are pushed ITM due to the abnormal purchase volume from the FTD settlement. More options being pushed further ITM causes Options Writers to purchase more shares to hedge for their potential losses causing a Gamma Squeeze. **This is how a ""small"" amount of FTDs can have a massive impact on price.** And it is exactly what we saw in January of 2021.

[Ryan Cohen's 12\/17-12\/18 Purchase Settles](https://preview.redd.it/fx7nhopn2l7d1.png?width=1201&format=png&auto=webp&s=06939c751f0d27f4b6ee29af63c991831aaa7298)

Ryan Cohen saw Gamestop as a possible turnaround story and pursued a stake in the Company.

His purchase Trade Dates are as follows:

12/17/2020 - Purchased 470,311 (Split Adjusted = 1,881,244)  
12/18/2020 - Purchased 500,000 (Split Adjusted = 2,000,000)  
12/18/2020 - Purchased 256,089 (Split Adjusted = 1,024,356)

Totals: 1,226,400 (Split Adjusted = 4,905,600)

Source: [https://fintel.io/n/cohen-ryan](https://fintel.io/n/cohen-ryan)

T+35 Calendar days from 12/17 and 12/18 would place his FTD settlement period limit at 1/21-23(Pre-Market)

Above you can see the sudden upward movement of the stock followed by an explosive price change. on January 23rd, 2020 in Pre-market.

Here are the values:

1/21/2021 - Opened at $9.81 Closed at $10.76 | Percentage Gain From Previous Close: 10.02%  
1/22/2021- Opened at $10.65 | Closed at $16.25 | Percentage Gain From Previous Close: **51.03%**  
1/23/2021 - Settlement Period Limit reached at 9:29am EST. Price opened at $24.18 | Percentage Gain From Previous Close: **48.8%**

*Edit* Fixed the years above to 2021 to correctly reflect sneeze date.

**Market Maker's ABUSE of Failure-To-Delivers via Naked Short Selling caused Ryan Cohen's purchase to be delayed until January 21-23(Pre-Market).** As thousands upon thousands of options contracts were pushed Into-The-Money, Options Writers **continued buying more and more shares to hedge their losses.** This created an extremely volatile trading day as millions upon millions of shares were quickly traded due to countless options contracts being **closed and re-opened.**

Okay but what about The Cycle™?

Ryan Cohen's purchase in to Gamestop may have inadvertently kicked off this whole saga, **but why did the stock have a pattern of jumps throughout these last 3+ years before April?**

Well, I can give you an example that will hopefully help us to understand this ""Cycle"" pattern.

[January 19th and 20th - February 23rd, 24th, and 25th \(Pre-Market\)](https://preview.redd.it/dhnspkx65k7d1.png?width=1588&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fe7181e68d54bcb87fa6c422a26ff1fef302e69)

January 19th, 2021 was a Monday following a drastic price jump that Gamestop had not seen for a VERY long time. The week of January 11th, the stock opened at $4.85(Post-Split) it closed the week at $8.88(Post-Split). **That is an 83% gain from open on Monday to close on Friday.**

It would be speculation to say that there may have been emergency calls/meetings held for these Market Makers and Authorized Participants; however, **I can confidently guess that the decision was made to open the following week HARD on Naked Shorting.** Monday and Tuesday (1/19 and 1/20), the price hardly moved as this shorting occurred. Hardly any shares were purchased by the Market maker to cover any non-options related orders. **Bear in mind volume was over 100 million shares each day that week (Post-Split).**

Once the FTDs from Ryan Cohen's purchase came due, millions of shares had to be purchased sending the stock price higher and higher. Options Writers quickly began purchasing more and more shares to hedge their losses. The resulting Gamma Squeeze sent the stock **parabolic**.

As soon as the momentum from the Gamma Squeeze was exhausted, mass options sell offs occurred beginning a general down trend; however, Market Makers were not happy with a ""general downtrend."" They needed Gamestop dropped and fast.

[January 29th and February 1st Incredible Naked Shorting](https://preview.redd.it/3untl3ez7k7d1.png?width=1635&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b13b30b81ae35353ac0693584fb3b43f89b011f)

**The buy button was removed and the fall from the Gamma Squeeze was so absurdly quick that even** ***amateur*** **investors could tell something HISTORICALLY criminal just occurred.**

Any short institution with a stake in Gamestop that COULD Naked Short this stock did so through it's entire fall after the initial Gamma Squeeze.

With fewer brokers able to purchase Gamestop due to the Clearing House restriction put in place just after the Gamma Squeeze peak, institutions at lower levels waited for their usual T+3 settlement limit hoping to buy at a lower price point. Market Makers and Authorized Participants Naked Shorted every share they could creating a massive ball of FTDs on a T+35 Calendar Day clock. **All this effort to stop the stock from resting at a MUCH higher base price and to prevent margin calls from forcing them to close long dated short positions.**

Their collusion worked temporarily as the price plummeted back to the low price of around $10 (Post Split). This most likely allowed them time to breath and re-position to survive what came next. Their extension for FTDs expired and the stock rocketed back up due to their required buy ins scheduled for late February.

**Each subsequent run up and run down is a re-run of this exact situation played at a slightly smaller scale each time.** Over time as more and more public investors (large, small, and institutional) lose interest/hope for the stock, less and less purchases are made and fewer shares need to be marked as FTD. Eventually, Market makers managed to return the stock to a very low price and have relative control over it's movement. **That is, until 2024.**

Due to my understanding of the initial Gamma Squeeze in 2021 and it's subsequent run ups:

**I believe that the key to Gamestop's release from the unlawful PRISON that is ABUSIVE naked shorting is the occurrence of multiple back-to-back gamma ramps each ignited by the Market Maker's Failure to Deliver abuse.**

# Entering The Volume - Volume Inflation

I believe this has already been covered, but I wanted to create a small section just as a *reminder* of why Gamestop has such absurd levels of volume over the course of months.

We have often seen mentions of the volume easily exceeding the available float of Gamestop's shares. **A big reason for that is due to FTDs. Every single FTD counts as a minimum of 2 volume per share.**

When an investor purchases shares through a Broker, they are added to that day's volume. The purchaser is told they have the shares in their account even though the purchase has not affected the price value. T+35 days later, the Market Maker will *actually* purchase the share, adding 1 to the volume for the day they purchased it.

This causes Gamestop's volume to inflate on a larger time scale. Looking at 3 months of volume, you will be unknowingly seeing **a portion of volume that has been doubled** due to FTD settlement.

# Dark - The Future of the Cycle

Earlier, I mentioned that Bullish investors were buying back into Gamestop in late April.

Gamestop's stock is on an uptrend and is garnering more interest from the pool of public investors. The more momentum Gamestop's stock has, the more purchasing occurs which means **more FTDs accumulating.** **If these FTDs happen to line up correctly,** they may reach their Settlement Period Limit later in the month, specifically on the 3rd Friday the **week of options and futures expirations.**

>*Triple witching hour is the last hour of the stock market trading session (3:00-4:00 P.M., New York City local Time) on the third Friday of every March,* ***June***\*, September, and December. Those days are the expiration of three kinds of securities:\*

>

>*Stock market index futures;*

>*Stock market index options;*

>*Stock options.*

>*The simultaneous expirations generally increases the trading volume of options, futures, and their underlying stocks, occasionally increasing the volatility of prices of related securities.*

Source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple\_witching\_hour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_witching_hour)

**The FTD purchasing along with Options and Futures contracts expiring could compound into a massive Gamma Squeeze of a similar or even larger movement than the original 2021 Sneeze.**

All that it would need is a decent amount of FTDs' Settlement Period Limits **to coincide with the same week if we were lucky, maybe the same DAY** if we were here for a *reckoning*.

But for that, we would need large investors with 100's of millions of dollars to buy into Gamestop all because they believe it is a great investment opportunity.

**Thankfully, we have possibly the most downright insane investor on Gamestop's side, DeepFuckingValue** AKA Roaring Kitty. Roaring Kitty may be crazy (aren't we all?), but he is also an *incredibly* smart trader.

\*SPECULATION AHEAD\*

I believe that DFV has taken advantage of the recent run-up/run-down to further his position and he MAY have made a large purchase 5/16/2024 while the stock was heading down from a recent large movement.

[May 16th DFV Possible Re-Entry After Selling April Calls](https://preview.redd.it/3ssfyiv1ek7d1.png?width=1833&format=png&auto=webp&s=0df6e1e9ce17d929d4e0809697715ac5dbe58ee2)

*""E\*Trade Considers Kicking Meme-Stock Leader Keith Gill Off Platform""*

[https://www.wsj.com/finance/regulation/e-trade-considers-kicking-meme-stock-leader-keith-gill-off-platform-f2003ec4](https://www.wsj.com/finance/regulation/e-trade-considers-kicking-meme-stock-leader-keith-gill-off-platform-f2003ec4)

In the above article (pay-walled, sorry), E-Trade has potentially broken Broker-to-Trader privacy regulations and leaked that DFV had purchased options previous to his social media return.

Due to the timing of Roaring Kitty's memes this year, it is my belief that DFV DID purchase options in April and sold them at or near the peak of May 15th. He then used the profits from that sale to purchase shares on the way down on 5/16/2024.

On Roaring Kitty's stream, he showed off how accurate the bull flag was to the bottom of the original Gamestop 2021 Sneeze. I believe that **Roaring Kitty predicted the stock would eventually bottom out to around this same price and chose a price near** **the bottom as his re-entry price.**

[\\""This is all a Test\\"" - Roaring Kitty most likely referring to \\""Testing Support\\"" on the Gamestop chart](https://preview.redd.it/ea6xhihjik7d1.png?width=952&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a19547faed16aff5af32ff62dd7621f3e3c0218)

**I speculate that Roaring Kitty entered into additional positions slightly above the support level of $10.**

Trading done in the previous 3 years as well as this new position would have his cost basis be **substantially** lowered from his original $55.17. He has purchased 4.8 million shares in the past 3 years and **we know that he averaged down HARD.**

It is possible that DFV purchased a large portion of his 5 Million shares near the bottom. If true, his purchase must have been large enough that Market Makers and Authorized Participants did **NOT** want to fulfill the order immediately. Instead, they used their T+35 Calendar Day special exemption to extend their delivery time.

At some point either slightly before or after his purchase, DFV decided that the stock has *definitely* bottomed out and he then loaded up on call options to take advantage of the eventual upward movement.

This leads us to the May run up. DFV's original stock purchase slightly above Gamestop's support line has now come due T+35 days later. The FTDs are settled for what could potentially be millions of share purchases. The purchases drive investor's options In-The-Money, sparking a Gamma Squeeze. DFV notices the price action, sells his options purchase near the peak and tries to find a good entry point as the stock is moving down after the Gamma Squeeze is exhausted.

My theory is that he **MAY** have made a purchase on May 16th 2024 as the math on his current cost basis could be averaging up after his large purchase in April.

I am using this tool to do very basic math for the cost basis:

[https://www.omnicalculator.com/finance/stock-average](https://www.omnicalculator.com/finance/stock-average)

Just as one example: In April, if DFV had managed to purchase the majority of his large position at $16, that would allow for a new purchase on May 16th at $28 to create a VERY similar cost basis of $21.33 vs his original June 2024 cost basis of $21.27. That is a $.06 difference while only using round price points for exit and entry.

I personally believe that DFV could have purchased in April at an even lower price point. The lower you use for his April purchase, the higher he may have purchased on May 16th.

*Disclaimer: Calculating cost basis is not as simple as I am depicting. This is just a scarcely detailed example to get my point across that this is a potential timeline of events. I am also did* ***not*** *try to perfectly re-create DFV's entire purchase history, I just used recent purchases to illustrate my point.*

**But why does any of this matter?**

Because if Roaring Kitty DID purchase on May 16th, it may have been a **substantial** purchase. Far too large for Market Makers or Authorized Participants to move off exchange. They clearly have a history of just delaying the purchase, so I am willing to bet that they have Naked Shorted here again. T+35 from May 16th, 2024 is June 20th, 2024. Market Makers are allowed to further extend the deadline until Pre-Market of the next day, June 21st, 2024.

**We have potentially been gifted a massive run-up on June 21st by Market Makers and Authorized Participants' extreme abuse of FTDs via Naked Short Selling. All of this because one small cat LOVES this damn stock.**

# Exercise Machine - Exercising VS Purchasing

*This topic was included in my original post. I will be adding an edited version and including it here for important context.*

I see many people going back and forth on whether DFV purchased shares directly or exercised some of his call options on June 13th, 2024.

I am here to tell you **he almost certainly did not exercise.**

Enough time has passed for us to know with near certainty that he has not exercised.

Per the Options Clearing Corporation:

>If it's an equity or ETF weekly option, exercise notices tendered on any business day will result in delivery of the underlying shares on the second (T+2)\* business day following exercise. Index options are cash-settled on the next business day following exercise.

*Edit* I think the OCC website was updated just today to reflect CAT changes. Options exercise delivery is now T+1.

Exercising options is very different from purchasing stock directly and apes are wise to recognize that purchasing options and exercising them allows retail to **actually affect the market price directly.** It essentially bypasses the T+35 day waiting period for our purchase to hit the market. To my knowledge, they do not and cannot delay settlement past T+2 for per options regulating restrictions.

However, DFV's transaction on June 13th would have **definitely** hit the market by now.

Since we have seen next to no upward pressure since his purchase, I would assume that he instead sold his options for cash on June 12th. The updated Open Interest dropped by a massive amount after market close. Roaring Kitty then posted his Dune tweet at 2PM EST on June 13th, and in my opinion, this is him excitedly posting that he just purchased the 4,001,000 shares. Can't imagine what that feels like. After hours on June 13th, DFV then posted his updated position confirming that he holds 4,001,000 additional shares.

If you need more solid evidence that DFV did **NOT** exercise, here is Dave Lauer's tweets with another user stating that they view this as an options sale to purchase more shares. Please remember Dave has been in the industry for **years**. Yes, he can make mistakes, but he is **NOT** an amateur investor trying to spread FUD.

[Dave Lauer on DFV's new Yolo](https://preview.redd.it/micri3ifpk7d1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6c03dced340a90f938b157178d37e586fa9c848)

A large part of the discussion seems to center around Premium cost factoring into cost basis.

**Dave's years of trading experience has led him to believe that Options Premium costs are not factored into your cost basis, only the Option's Strike Price.**

So a trader reached out to DFV's Broker, E-Trade, to clarify if they factor in a premium cost to a position's cost basis in your account position portal.

[E-Trade Does NOT Factor in Premiums to Cost Basis](https://preview.redd.it/pucdpmdypk7d1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=80708afd66cb414e55aaa0e7ce2bf59d2d36159a)

**E-Trade reported that they ONLY use the Options Strike Price to adjust your Cost Basis.**

**DFV** ***almost certainly\**** **did NOT exercise his call options.**

**\*EDIT\* \***  
Several of you have reached out to me with doubts regarding E-Trade factoring in premiums for options cost basis. I agree with all of you that it seems like an odd choice to leave them out. So I wanted to include my opinion here:

In my mind, the chances of DFV exercising vs purchasing direct stock are at *least* an equal stalemate.

The math on his cost basis can be reached in either situation, so we need to look at other variables to make a decision.

If DFV exercised early, he lost out on many days of theta value. Selling his calls and then buying directly would net him *substantially* more shares than exercising too early. In the past, DFV has exercised his options by allowing them to expire ITM. It is my personal view that, if he wanted to exercise while the price action was relatively normal, he would have used this same method of allowing them to expire ITM.

Some people will say that his decision to exercise early was a part of some plan; however, T+1 has passed for the Exercised Securities Settlement Period Limit and nothing has happened. If exercising was his plan, it did not seem to work.

>**Exercise Settlement Time:**  Exercise notices tendered on any business day will result in delivery of the underlying stock on the first (T+1) business day following exercise.

Source: [https://www.theocc.com/clearance-and-settlement/clearing/equity-options-product-specifications](https://www.theocc.com/clearance-and-settlement/clearing/equity-options-product-specifications)

It is my personal opinion that DFV *does* have a plan to ride out the 2024 Gamestop action and selling his calls to buy the most shares possible seems to benefit him the most.

Coincidentally, it also can benefit us.



Since DFV is a trader that loves to interact with a community, he often **publicly posts his positions**. Now that DFV is a *whale,* a direct stock purchase that he makes on the market is almost *guaranteed* to be **millions of shares of FTDs**. With knowledge of the date of his purchase, we can make an estimate on when his purchase will *actually* affect the share price and take a position in the stock to benefit off of it. This unique set of circumstances is ONLY possible because one MASSIVE whale LOVES this stock *and* **Market Makers and Authorized Participants are ILLEGALY ABUSING THEIR RIGHTS TO NAKED SHORT.**

DFV's *near confirmed* June purchase date is June 13th, 2024.

**T+35 Calendar Days would put his direct stock purchase hitting the market on July 18th. However, Market Makers will most likely wait until the last minute by pushing it to Pre-Market of Friday, July 19th, 2024.**

I personally believe that DFV's *unconfirmed* May purchase date is May 16th, 2024,

**T+35 Calendar Days would put his direct stock purchase hitting the market on June 20th. However, Market Makers will most likely wait until the last minute by pushing it to Pre-Market of Friday, June 21st, 2024.**

# Conclusion - On the Shoulders of Giants

Thank you to anyone that stuck through and read this post!

The Gamestop saga is one **hell** of a ride and I personally cannot wait for GME to break free of it's Naked Short prison and fly free.

It is impossible for me to list everyone who has contributed DD to Superstonk but I am completely serious when I say that I am standing on the shoulders of absolute **GIANTS.** And those giants are standing on other giants ~~that are standing on other giants that also stand on giants that are all standing on Rick of Spades.~~

Seriously, 5 years ago if you told me that I would be spending time the equivalent of a full workday to write about this kind of shit in the stock market, I would have asked you to leave me alone.

Over three years of DD and chart watching must have formed a nice new wrinkle in my ape brain and that is thanks to all of you here at Superstonk.

**My understanding of this situation may need additional expanding or some small corrections; however, I believe I have at least nailed down what has caused this stock to behave so bizarrely starting from January 2021.**

**-**

With all of that said, I would like to put money in mouth:

[doxxed my account number because I am truly regarded. Edited Position Picture](https://preview.redd.it/hkk0dx1ndl7d1.png?width=1419&format=png&auto=webp&s=38d3a7ea51e8a43fab386f1d0309f1bfc2e01ec8)

**This ugly fucking nightmare of a position is mine.**

I currently have 2,200 shares worth of leverage. I also have a bit more buying power left. Assuming the price stays relatively low on Thursday, I plan to purchase additional contracts for June 21st.

I want to make one thing **VERY** clear:

June 21st may or MAY NOT run up due to an FTD Settlement Period Limit+Gamma Hedging Squeeze.

I am LESS confident about June 21st than I am about July 19th.

The July 19th date is based off of two *nearly confirmed* data points: DFV publicly posted that he purchased a large amount of shares on June 13th, 2024. Even though we cannot be *absolutely* sure he purchased them *on that day* I believe due to his past posts, that **he is honest with the community**.

June 21st only has my ***best estimate*** of DFV's May purchase. **If my guess is wrong, I could lose all of the money I have poured into premiums for that ugly bastard of an options position that I call my own.**

Purchasing 1-2 Day To Expiry Options Contracts is historically a DumbFuckingMove™ and I do NOT recommend following me into **this risky as hell gamble.**

If you *are* like me and believe that the FTD Settlement Limit Periods are driving the stock movement, **it would be MUCH safer to bet on July 19th, 2024** as we have a much better idea of the exact purchase date our resident whale bought his shares on. I even have a small amount of money set aside as a backup in case my May purchase date theory is wrong and I will use that to essentially YOLO into July 19th, 2024 Expiry, or possibly the week after, July 26th, 2024.

*EDIT* Wanted to add this. PLEASE be aware how risky June 21st options are. The company completed a MASSIVE share offering in the middle of my May-June timeline. It is entirely possible that Market Makers used this offering to offset FTD settlement. It is also possible that Market Makers doubled down and added additional Naked Shorts during this offering. This is gamble I am taking.

Some have asked me how I feel about DRS. I will let this speak for itself:

[I deeply regret not YOLOing in for more shares during the $10-$12 dollar range...](https://preview.redd.it/0wo8u04xal7d1.png?width=749&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3d86705507f339f9ba1e77e9dc2b2a809ab8521)

I could not find a good spot to fit this into the post, but I did want to remind everyone that June 21st 2024 is the farthest dated LEAPS from January 2021. This may be an additional factor to consider as, anyone that was trying to reposition their options contracts *may* have chosen the farthest available date on the chain.

Oh and a neat trick I learned the other day...

As long as you have enough cash in your Options trading account, In-The-Money Options contracts **automatically exercise** by 5PM on the expiration date. (At least for Fidelity.)

I thought that was kind of neat.

**SMALL ASIDE REGARDING FTD DATA RELEASES**

The adjustments of my prediction for DFV's may purchase **completely invalidates** my previous theory about FTD reporting in my last post ""I Would Like To Solve the Puzzle - T+3, T+6, T+35"".

If I had to guess at why our FTD data is pretty much a crapshoot, I would reach for the utterly *classic* line of ""this data is self reported and cannot be fully relied upon."" *\*chefs kiss\**

Those missing days are most likely just days that reported 0 FTDs for that day. Whether you believe that they are reporting honestly is up to you.

Last, but not least. I thought to include my favorite song for all of you. Hopefully it will get you guys excited for Friday and remind you of all we are doing here in Superstonk.

[**TIFU by being tricked by a straight guy into dating him**](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/yhnqsz/tifu_by_being_tricked_by_a_straight_guy_into/) - 30 October 2022

So to start things off. I’m gay, I live in a small town in the middle of nowhere USA. I’m a Male 18.

I wasn’t ever really bullied for being gay. Unless it was online everyone was cool with it except the super conservative families in town. Of course I’ve heard my fair share of names and threats but I shrug them off. It’s normal to me. 

There’s this group of boys, who are like the super bro dude straight guy group of the school. They act more gay than I do but still call me names etc. In this group there’s this guy I’ll call Skyler.

Skyler is my age, looks like a puppy dog,  and was very sweet to me always, but always presented as straight. Which is why I was shocked when he asked me out this summer. I mean. I’m not ugly or anything. I just didn’t expect this super dude bro jock to ask me out. 

Our first date was amazing. I mean, it was on the Fourth of July at our state fair. We got corn dogs played games and he kissed me on the Ferris wheel. 

After a few dates we had gotten a lot closer. (We never had sex though, he wanted to wait and I respected that) my ex boyfriends birthday was on October 20th. 

He had this huge party and invited everyone and of course I wasn’t shocked when he invited me. This is where I was stupid, I was head over heels for this guy. I was like stupid in love with him. I mean I’d get giddy every single time I saw him and I’d get butterflies in my chest whenever he touched me even after three months. I was in love with him. I think part of me still is which is why I’m heartbroken writing this. 

I bought my boyfriend skyler this beautiful pendant and chain. It was a 18 karot gold with a diamond. (Very expensive, cost me two years of working part time at McDonald’s) I was very excited to give this to him. 

At his party he brushed me off the entire time. I gave him his gift and a letter that I wrote from the bottom of my heart. I thought we were forever. 

Turns out it was all a lie. He started getting giggly with his friends reading the letter and when he finished he was crying laughing. 

That’s when he started explaining that it was all a dare and that he only went out with the town “f slur” to win a bet. He thanked me for the necklace and went on with his party.

I’ve stayed home for several days now. Im heartbroken and just devastated. I thought this boy was the absolute love of my life. Turns out all of his friends was in on everything. To the text messages and the letters we would write each other. 

We were on the down low because he said he wasn’t ready to tell his family he was bisexual. This was already a red flag I ignored because his mom is bisexual, and would’ve been completely fine with it. But this entire time he tricked me. He broke my heart into pieces and I can’t help but scream into my pillow. I want to hurt him the way I hurt. I want to hear him scream the gut wrenching screams I scream late at night when the earth is quiet into my pillow so my family can’t hear me. 

I can’t go back to school, I am already the laughing stock on social media. I’m thinking of switching schools and going to live with my aunt. I was blinded by love and hurt. 

Edit: I’ll update everyone on what happens next. I’m gonna tell his mom and try to get my necklace back. Thanks for the support everyone. 

Edit 2: sorry guys mods locked the post because of the comments that violated rules. If you wanna post a comment. Check out my account and post a comment on my latest post ❤️

TLDR: ignored red flags of guy who asked me out, dated for three months, buy him expensive necklace, he says it was a dare

[**Repost UPDATE**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Economy_Leek123/comments/ykf55b/repost_update/) - 2 November 2022 

Hey everyone, so I got my post taken down because I linked a subreddit to where people could make comments :/ 

I thank everyone who've reached out, I mean, I didn't expect this post to go as viral as it did. 4.6 million views, videos on tiktok and YouTube. I had over 100 people in my messages and I tried to reply to each one. In total I had around 1000 comments on my subreddit post and the OG post, I read every single one of them. 

For everyone commenting and asking about my parents, My dad has been very supportive throughout the whole process. My mom however has been rather distant about everything. She doesn't really like LGBTQ community but has tried changing her views with me. I guess it's all I can ask of her.

At first I thought It would be better to go over to his house to confront his mother. My dad was willing to go along with me but I couldn't really bear to see him. I was very nervous at first when I messaged Skyler's Mom on Facebook last night. I mean she didn't believe me in the beginning. She never thought her son could do something so horrible. I sent her some of our photos and messages, she didn't reply for a bit but later would call me. I explained everything, from July till October.

She was quiet for a long time after I finished. I mean I was still sniffling through the phone. She asked me if I still loved her son. I mean I was crying almost the entire time because I am still in love with him. I mean, how can you go from loving someone so easily to hating them the next? Isn't that ironic? Those we love can do the most horrible things to us and yet we still find a way to care about them. So I told her yes. 

She would then tell me she experienced something similar with a guy. How he was dared to lead her on for a few weeks. How she knew how I felt because she felt the same way at the time. She learned to let go. She would then go on to talk with me for an hour or two about how things were between us. Everything felt surreal after that. She would then message me later that night that she isn't able to force her son to give the necklace back, but she's terribly sorry and that Skyler is staying at his Dad's for the time being. He's probably extremely upset about it, the main reason the divorce happened, (from what Skyler told me) is that his dad couldn't really accept his mom. 

I felt crappy then but it felt good getting everything out to someone so close to him. I don't wanna talk to him, yet I do. I want my necklace back, I mean I dont know how im gonna get it back. I might have to cross post on r/legaladvice I mean technically it was a gift. As expensive as it was, I understand how immature it was of me to spend so much on a gift. But I didn't really care at that time about the cash. 

I stayed home from school today. But I think Im gonna confront him tomorrow at school, Not in front of his friends, not in front of the class or anything like some teenage rom com from Disney. But I am gonna try to find him sometime alone. Does anyone have any advice? 

For everyone telling me it wasn’t love. It felt like love. but everyone telling me that I wasn’t in love is weird. I would’ve rather died than someone to hurt him. I would’ve done anything for him, and even now, even after all the hurt that I’ve been given, the slurs, the hate, the lies, I still don’t want to see him hurt. I still see his smile, I can still feel the sweet gestures and hear our conversations. 

This is an rising trend in the LGBTQ community. Homophobic people baiting gays and the situations are on the rise. If you can, talk to your community about this. We need to spread light on the problems with queer-baiting.

(I posted this last night but deleted it because of developments) Basically, Skyler and a few of his friends were just shit talking me on social media on Instagram live, calling me slurs, saying that I lied to his mom about stuff. Advice would be appreciated. I’ll update you

Edit 1 hey the mods locked the comments due again! Please leave a comment here. https://www.reddit.com/user/Economy_Leek123/comments/yhvd5a/post_locked/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

TLDR: Talked with Skylers mom, She has him staying with his dad. I didn't get my necklace back. I am gonna confront him

I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,"I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page, regardless of the subreddit, then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How is ""Hype"" calculated?**

Well, this is a little tricky but it's based on the engagement that the post received in that sub-reddit relative to other posts in the same sub-reddit

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

FROM A PROFESSIONAL CHEF TO YOU: The tricks that anyone should know when they buy food.,"I wager everyone here knows some of these things, but I’m gonna list everything I can think of in regards to eating healthy and well. I’m gonna make this a list with sections, so hopefully it’s easy enough to parse.

—————-LEGUMES———————

-Buy these dried as often as possible. Keep a stock of beans, lentils, and dried chickpeas around if you can. They’re cheap, almost always available, and virtually imperishable. As such, assuming you don’t throw them out and keep them properly stored, buying these is a 100% return on your investment. 

-Legumes are one of the most versatile options in your kitchen. As long as you soak them and put them in the fridge before you go to bed they’ll be available the next day to cook quickly. These are the best thing to have if you’re looking to stretch a meal because of their nutrient density and the fact that they’re just damn delicious on their own. 

-Look into middle-eastern and African cuisine for creative ways to use these ingredients. Some really common examples are lentil curry, hummus, falafels, and putting chickpeas in a shakshuka. This isn’t a recipe post, so look up how to make them yourself - some grandma has a better (and probably even cheaper) recipe than I do.

————-GRAINS AND CEREALS ————

-Like legumes, these are very versatile. However, I find most people know very little about them outside of wheat and maybe oats. I highly recommend learning what the most commonly eaten grans and cereals in your locality are, and then finding the affordable ones. There will be at least one. I guarantee it. 

-FLOUR is an essential staple, unless you’re celiac or gluten free - a topic on which I won’t speak because I’m confident anyone who has to deal with those issues knows more than I do. I recommend grabbing all-purpose flour due to its gluten content being a middle ground between low-gluten pastry flour and high-gluten bread flour. You can still use it to make bread, and it has a myriad other uses as a binder or thickener for sauces. 

-RICE is amazing, as most know already, but seriously - it’s one of the most important crops in the world. It’s kept civilizations alive on its back for all of recorded history, and it’ll keep you alive, too. There is no better “fill me up” food I can think of.  Wait for those huge sacks of rice to go on sale (it happens pretty frequently), then buy 2. They last forever. Ideally grab long-grain rice if you’re just looking for a side-dish or fried rice base, but in a pinch short grain’ll do; it’s just less forgiving and the starches don’t retrograde as fully so when you cool it it doesn’t keep as nicely. 

-KEEP IN MIND that rice is pure carbs. It’s a good base, but you need other stuff to go with it or else you’ll be deficient in nutrients and feel awful all the time. Trust me from experience - college me went through a raw-egg-on-rice phase, and it wasn’t pretty. 

-BARLEY, also, is amazing, but for other reasons. It’s high in protein and iron, and can help dramatically improve your nutrient intake for very little cost. In soups, roasted in tea (thanks Korea), and used in tandem with rice, it can go a very, very long way in making your diet a more sustainable one in times of austerity and plenty, alike.

-AVOID “SUPERFOODS”. Not because they’re bad for you - just because of their jacked prices. Not to mention oftentimes the industries surrounding them are ethical nightmares. Don’t get me started on avocado cartels and the impact of quinoa farming on low-income South American communities. In reality, most grains and cereals have a lot of nutrients and minerals, and they’re often overlooked. Learn the nutrition facts, and make decisions accordingly. Google and online databases are your friends, here. 

———FRUITS AND VEGETABLES———

-ONIONS: buy them fresh and store them in dry, enclosed spaces, and buy tomatoes canned and without salt added. Use onions in almost everything, they’re delicious, cheap, and nutritious. 

-TOMATOES: Good fresh and better canned. Use fresh tomatoes raw for whatever you want and use canned tomatoes for sauces. Buy canned tomatoes with as little added salt and sugar as possible. 

- POTATOES: Treat these as a starch option similar to grains or cereals. Buy them unprocessed, in a sack.  Store them in dry, enclosed spaces. 

-BASICALLY EVERY FRUIT: go for it, these things are nutrient bombs and they’re delicious. Buy them seasonally for the best value and if you have a day to do so, preserve them if you ever see a huge sale. I’m still enjoying lacto-fermented blueberries from last year’s insane blueberry harvest where I could buy a pint for a dollar.

-FOR SHOPPING: Generally when you buy produce you should go, in order, to the discount rack, then the sales, and then everything else. Someone out there has a recipe for literally everything, and some of them are even good. A pepper with a blemish or tiny spot of mold is still fine, assuming you cut away the blemish or tiny spot of mold. 

-I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH; FIND THE UNDER-APPRECIATED AND OVER-SUPPLIED PRODUCE. There’s always a bin of some forgotten veggie no-one eats for some reason. In the west, at least, it seems to often be rutabagas/turnips. I’ve also seen apples in the fall, corn, and cabbages fall into this category. This is because of a good harvest, or because of a lack of consumer interest - any time this happens, capitalize on it. Everything is delicious if you cook it properly. Buy seasonally, and learn how to use the things you buy. You’ll eat like a king and pay like a pauper.

-CANNED STUFF - I generally have a personal aversion to all canned veggies and fruits except tomatoes, but that’s just my privilege speaking. If you want to buy them or if fresh produce is hard to come by, avoid getting anything with added salt or sugar. Cross-reference the nutrient info on the can with info from a fresh counterpart to avoid buying filler garbage, and try to find somewhere to live with better food accessibility. Alternatively, save up and make a killing by opening a fruit and vegetable market to remove the need to read this very ling post any further. (This is a joke and I recognize the struggle of those in impoverished communities with awful food accessibility.)

-FROZEN STUFF - frozen fruit and veg is great,
mostly. Maybe dodge the chopped carrots and corn a lot of us ate growing up or find in bad takeout Chinese food, but hey - grab that bag of frozen berries or peas and throw ‘em in anything that warrants it. Technology for frozen produce has improved dramatically in the last few decades, and we should capitalize on that.


——-PROTEINS——-

-IF YOU EAT MEAT, buy the least processed cuts you can. Whole chickens, meat on the bone, and ground meats are your best friends. Go to butcher shops, if you can. Freezing meat is fine, but try to avoid buying pre-made frozen protein options. Get raw product and do the work yourself to save a LOT of cash and get better food out of it.

-MEAT IS A LUXURY, NOT AN ESSENTIAL. I say this because in modern western culture eating meat everyday is seen as normal. This is an oddity when we examine all of human history, and this notion should be abandoned if we’re trying to live more affordably. Meat is grossly overrepresented in most diets, and you should always ask if you could cut your portion of meat down in exchange for more vegetables and grains.

-LEARN HOW TO BREAK DOWN YOUR PROTEINS. A chicken isn’t just 8 portions of meat - it’s also bones and carcass for a stock or soup, fat to be rendered out and used as a cooking oil (thanks, jewish folks!), and skin to be cooked down into delicious little chips. This same list can be used for
pork, beef, and any other mammal you eat. 

-FISH IS IFFY. Like, as an industry. Not many people know their fish, and fish processing companies know that and capitalize on it. I always tell people who like fish to buy fresh and whole, and to learn how to pick good fish. Buying cheap processed fish products is akin to asking to be ripped off, to harm the environment, and to accumulate toxins in your body, all at the same time. To not get completely F-ed over by what is maybe the worst food industry in the world you need to know your fish, know the company you’re buying from, and know who’s doing the fishing. Good luck, and please try not to contribute to the death of our water ecosystems. (A good trick is that if you can afford fish when you’re poor and you don’t live beside a large body of water, you almost certainly DON’T WANT IT.)

-IF YOU DO BUY FISH OR SEAFOOD, all the rules for proteins apply. Fish bones and crustacean shells for stock, fat deposits on the occasional salmonid for whatever you want, and fish skin, if it’s your cup of tea, for a lovely snack. Hell, fish organs and salt make up the base for a fermented fish sauce, if you really want to go the extra mile. Rome survived off of fish sauce and bread for longer than our society has been around. The one big difference between fish and meat is that frozen fish tends to suck relative to fresh in a much bigger way - both in terms of quality and retained nutrients. Put frozen fish in soups or curries, to avoid nutrient drain from the water that inevitably will leak out of your fish.

FOR VEGETARIANS AND VEGANS: You know more about your protein options than I do, and honestly they would require a lot of research I haven’t done to fully discuss. Clearly I have more to learn on the subject, and intend to do so. I only encourage you all to do the same ✌️

——-EVERYTHING ELSE——-

-STAY AWAY FROM THE INSTANT RAMEN. I know it’s cheap. I KNOW you like how easy it is. I don’t give one flying fuck. It’s awful for you, it isn’t cheaper than a bowl of rice with soy sauce, a fried egg, and some frozen peas, and it’ll kill you slowly. Just don’t, and ignore anyone’s advice about how it got them through college. Hell, if anyone’s advice involves doing what they did in college, take it with a grain of salt. There’s good advice sometimes, and a LOT of bad.

-AVOID THE JUNK FOOD AISLES. Chips, sugar cereals, premade salad dressings, sweet juice/pop, and processed foods like KD or tv dinners are not the way to go if you’re looking to get the most out of your dollar at the grocery store. They’re bad for you, they’re expensive relative to the cost of production, and they put a burden on your body that you’ll pay for down the line. Exceptions to this are staple sauces like a good soy sauce and fish sauce, grains and legumes, and canned veggies. 

-CHEESE IS A LUXURY, SO TREAT IT LIKE ONE. If you’re gonna buy it I recommend buying less of it less often, and buying the good stuff when you do. Kraft block cheese only costs as little as it does because it’s the by-product of the real money-maker: whey protein production. If you’re gonna buy cheese, please support a real cheesemaker. The cheese lover in you will be happier for it. 

-ALCOHOL IS ALSO A LUXURY. If you want a drink, I recommend doing it less often and drinking the good stuff. If you like the cheap stuff that’s fine, “good stuff” is all relative anyway. Just drink less and focus on quality over quantity, whatever your preferences are. 

-MAKE YOUR OWN COFFEE, AND BUY A THERMOS. I know Starbucks is delicious. Guess what? You can find a recipe for every drink they make online, and then make it better. Some restaurants literally survive because they can sell coffee at a nearly 2000% markup. Truck stop diners and high-end coffee shops do this. I recommend making cold brew the night before, since you literally just have to strain it in the morning rather than brewing a pot.

-FINALLY, LEARN TO COOK. All of this information is fundamentally more useful if you know how to cook. Not knowing how to cook is a luxury afforded to those with the means to afford living in ignorance of this most basic human skill. You are living outside your means if you live in a well-off country, don’t make a least $60k a year, and can’t cook. 


Best of luck to you all. Stay safe out there.

EDIT: A number of folks pointed out lots of things to me which I wasn’t aware of in regard to beekeeping, so I cut that section out as it was misrepresentative of the industry and failed to highlight key problems in it. Others felt I was being mean to vegans and vegetarians and regardless as to my intentions, I can see evidence that that whole section detracts from this list as a whole and isn’t informative enough to keep. I’ve removed it accordingly. Thanks for the feedback, positive or negative - keep doing good work ✌️

EDIT: Someone made a good point that grocery stores are all laid out different, and not everyone knows the “centre aisles” mantra. So I changed it to “Junk food aisles” for clarity.

EDIT: I somehow mistakenly said South African communities were effected by Quinoa production when in fact it’s primarily South American.

TIFU by drinking a Gallon of milk in one hour to shove it in Reddit’s face,"It’s still in my post history because I am permanently keeping it as a reminder that I’m a fucking idiot whenever my ego gets out of check. 

Okay so this morning I posted on Reddit a conversation me and my friends had in which we all unanimously agreed that drinking a gallon of milk in under an hour is 100% possible and is an incredibly easy challenge. My reasoning was that an entire hour is a lot of time, and that if you just slowly and steadily drink the milk while portioning yourself there’s no reason why anybody can’t do it. One of the lesser challenges was doing a half gallon in an hour and I can say from a certain experience with hot sauce a while ago that I was 100% capable of achieving that so I was absolutely confident I could do two.

I posted it to Reddit, feeling pretty high and mighty of myself on the “unpopular opinions” board and was immediately provided with multiple comments informing me that I was an idiot and had no idea what I was talking about. These comments from inferior humans asked me to record my endeavors and I was without a doubt ready and willing to prove them wrong. So I went to my local 7/11, bought a gallon of 2% and got back to my dorm. 

I will give myself credit through my naive ego, I did prepare for the worst a little bit, I sat with a towel bib in case of dribblage and pre-opened one of the shower stalls because the toilets would not account the possible gallons worth milk that could occur from the bovi-licious odyssey I was about to traverse upon. So I turned on my video camera and filled up 5 approximately 25 ounces cups of milk. 

Looking at these completely full cups infront of me, the milk carton definitely tricks you with its sheer volume and I was realizing the challenge ahead of me, but mama didn’t raise no bitch so I went in.

First cup: Totally easy, I love milk, my father, brother and I will go through a gallon within 2-3 days tops, and all I have to do is do this every 12 minutes and I’m home free and all those losers on Reddit will know how cool I am.

Second cup: I down this one too, easy peasy, though the first signal to my brain that I was very much so satiated with my daily value of calcium was already upon us. Though this was a challenge even the greatest often failed at, I wasn’t going to underestimate this challenge, but rather like a matador I will corral this bull with steadiness and finesse.

Third cup: this one I was able to not consistently down, I got about half way through and I had to breathe for a second. But I have a 12 minute window to down this so I don’t have to rush it. The camera is still recording, I wonder if I have to post this full hour of footage to prove it or if I can just skip to each time I drink. Ha. Imagine the looks on their faces when they see I can drink an entire gallon. How much time till my next cup? IVE GOT 30 SECONDS?! 

Fourth cup: OKAY! I FINISHED THE THIRD CUP IN THE TIME WINDOW! The 12 minute mark hit and I didn’t immediately drink it, I picked it up, inspected it’s beautiful color and temperature, and immediately had to put it back down because a certain noise just befell my ears... did my stomach just... hiccup? Me and humbleness have a very long distance relationship, and as the crazy zodiac girl in my nursing classes has informed me, “you totally DO give off Leo energy”. And while my understanding of stars is lacking I think that translates to at this very moment, I definitely have gotten myself into a bad scenario thanks to my ego”. I begin to drink the fourth cup and my stomach is really starting to slosh around, it’s just stagnant and sitting in there and I can feel it truly filling up. SOMEHOW, BY SHEER MIRACLE OR LUCK, I get cup 4 down within the time window with a few minutes to spare. 

Fifth cup: ALL. I. DID. WAS. BURP. A very small burp, but up with it came a mouth full of milk. I realized my fate was sealed. As I swallowed it back down I knew that the second part of the challenge was actually sitting there and not puking as the body begins to naturally break down the lactose and shit in the milk. I haven’t even touched the fifth cup yet, just decided to bring my knees up to my chest to help with the completely full stomach... then, I, very graciously I should add, sprinted like a mad man to the open shower, kneeled on that gross ass floor and prepared for the inevitable. 10 seconds.. 15... nothing was happening... so I slowly got up and went to head back to my room to hopefully finish the challenge, and THEN I BUMPED THE STALL DOOR RIGHT INTO MY GUT. 

In that moment I saw two things, the white of the milk projectile ejecting from my mouth into the shower floor from my rapidly turning head as to not destroy everything. And the vision of God punishing me for the next probably 40 years because I attempted to achieve the ways of the golden calf. 

It is now 5 hours later, and Reddit has won this time with their stupid facts and basic science that I chose to ignore. I am still making frequent trips to the bathroom with generous supplies of dairy for the toilet from both ends. If you need me I will be listening to “I told you so’s” from the toilet. 

Tl;dr: I try to best Reddit by drinking a whole gallon of milk and now my stomach is churning to the point that I may shit butter

Edit: It has been only two hours and so far I have seen many people read this story, understand my overconfidence within it, and then comment that they bet they could personally do the challenge themselves and will be trying soon, which makes me feel better knowing that I am not ill for this world. Thanks guys!

[Spoilers] Epilogue: After The Wheel,"In the long years of his reign, King Brandon Stark was not loved by the smallfolk nearly so much as the quietude of his rule. Bran himself was a distant and near-silent king, with no taste for great celebrations or inspiring rhetoric. But when the Driftwood Queen demanded the independence of the Iron Islands in 313 AC, Bran granted it almost immediately; the expanded fleet that the Greyjoys had long laboured over had hardly left its harbours before the raven returned from King’s Landing. Dorne’s autonomy grew not with violence, but with carefully negotiated partnership, and though now Ornelia Martell is styled the Princess of Dorne, the Maesters of Oldtown would say that the lands beyond the Red Mountains are more closely entwined – through trade and goodwill – with the Five Kingdoms than ever before. It is said that, though the Seven Kingdoms became Six through the sacrifice of a million lives, the Six became Five without a single drop of spilt blood.

These years of calm saw the turn of seven long summers and seven mild winters. The external threats to Bran’s reign – the Braavosi blockade of 309, sponsored by the Iron Bank and facilitated by many mercenaries; the Second Crossing of the Dothraki Khalasar in 318; the Septons’ Rising of 331 or the coming of the Red Refugees in the decade afterward – seemed less desperate in comparison to the crises endured by King’s Landing in the warlike years before, as if an invisible hand were directing events, by slight nudges, toward the ends of stability and prosperity. Though terrible battles were rumoured in many parts of Essos, their effects were seldom felt in Westeros. One might also have expected some friction to arise from the King’s worship of the Old Gods, but Bran’s habits were so private, and his style of rule so tolerant, that for a time it seemed impossible that internal strife and religious discord could ever have been the hallmark of the Six – and then the Five – Kingdoms.

The absence of vengeful dragons surely helped. There are folk in Volantis who, in exchange for a cup of sweet wine, will tell the tale of their fathers or grandfathers catching sight of a great winged creature that obscured the waning moon in its eastbound flight, high above the city. Some of the Ghiscari traders who can now be so frequently found in Planky Town or Storm's End tell a similar story: that in the cold night after the death of the Dragon Queen, her last child, screaming with anguish, caused many a night-time watcher to return to their decks in great haste. Daenerys was carried far into the east, perhaps as far as the Shadowlands or the unknown forests of Ulthos. What became of her remains is not known. Some say the creature flew until fatigue brought it plummeting into deep, uncharted waters. Others suggest that reports of dragons - fleeting glimpses, disappearing livestock, bone-chilling cries in the lonely places of the world - are not always the product of fancy or hysteria.

Bran outlived every member of his original Small Council, and outlasted – as far as can be known for certain – every other Stark. Of his sister Arya, the Hero of Winterfell, little was ever heard again: she sailed West, beyond the reckoning and knowledge of all, within days of her brother’s coronation, leaving only the rumours that are shared and rendered into stories in every town of Westeros and Essos: of a single, ragged-looking Raven that flew out of a storm over the Western Sea decades later and on to the last high tower of the Red Keep, bearing a message whose contents were seen only by the King and his closest advisors. The tale that is most often told is that Arya reached the land that is West of West, and shared what details she could of the wonders and terrors she found there before meeting her own mysterious fate. What is certainly true is that, slowly and deliberately, Bran has been fortifying the Western coast of the Five Kingdoms throughout the latter part of his reign. 

Sansa Stark, the Queen in the North, maintained strong relations with her brother’s kingdom and toward the end of her life was frequently to be found in the courts of King’s Landing or Dorne, having inherited from her mother a preference for the warmth. After her passing in 371 her bannermen selected Harrold Royce to rule the North.

Of the fate of Jon Snow – the Bastard of Winterfell, the Half-Stark, the Queenslayer, the Resurrected, the Friend of Wolves, twice named Lord Commander of Castle Black – very little is known. The Hand of the King, Tyrion Lannister, visited the North and the Wall in the first decade after Snow's return to the Night’s Watch. Of that visit he records that the Wall was all but unmanned, and that those who stood upon it were facing south, rather than north. The Hand was told that Jon Snow had, years earlier, gone forth with a great company of wildlings and northerners, disappearing into the dark forests of the Lands of Always Winter. Their exploration of those unmapped places are the subject of much conjecture: that Snow had been named the King Beyond the Wall, that he had made contact with the last enclaves of the Children of the Forest, that he was overseeing the settling of great underground cities among the twisting, interconnected roots of the Weirwood trees. It is said that the Greyjoys know something of those northernmost lands, and that Sansa Stark, before her death, knew more, but would not tell. The Lonely King, Bran the Broken, Bran the Bridgemaker, Bran the Wheelbreaker, surely knew more still – but in his quiet places and sanctuaries around King’s Landing, he seldom spoke a word, and to each successive Hand and Archmaester he entrusted fewer of his thoughts.

Finally, in 382 AC, at the start of his eighth winter, King Brandon embarked upon a final journey. He had aged but slowly in all the years of his reign, but age had come upon him nevertheless. His Kingsguard escorted him on the first leg of his journey – a secretive consultation followed by long weeks of contemplation or reading in Oldtown – and then took him as far as the Wall when at last he travelled North. After a night in the almost uninhabited Castle Black, Bran ordered the Kingsguard to return to Winterfell, and so on to the Five Kingdoms, where they were to supervise the selection of a new King of Westeros.

The last of the Starks then travelled North, beyond the wall, quite alone. The Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch reported that distant figures joined the King’s horse just before it disappeared into the treeline. No sight or word of King Bran has been heard in the long years since.

The winters are deeper now, and though King’s Landing is again fair and no great wars have troubled Westeros for many decades, some of the world’s wonder has diminished since the end of the time of Bran the Wheelbreaker.

Is this the hottest wing you have?,"I used to own a wing joint. Nothing fancy, but a good selection of wing flavors and beer. 

Inevitably we would have people come in and order the suicide wings (I like super spicy foods, so these were pretty damn hot). Of those people, about 5-10% would always start the joke/sarcastic conversation ""These aren't that hot. Can't you do better?!?"" Yuk, yuk, yuk. 

One of my best regulars, a dentist who fancied himself a gardner, decided to help us out and planted a ghost pepper bush (at the time the hottest pepper in the world) and he could bring us the bounty of his harvest. And he would intentionally under water the bush so the peppers would be as hot as they could be...

When he would bring us the peppers, I would grind them (seeds and all) into a nice paste which I would combine with our suicide sauce and keep to the side for when our spicy wing coneseurs would show up and complain about the suicide sauce not being hot enough. 

I would only serve them one Death Head wing (seemed a fitting name). I would make them wear gloves to eat it to prevent capsaicin burns on their skin. I would specifically tell them about the heat they were about to get into, trying to dissuade them from eating this culinary monstrosity. 

By the time we got through all this, every single person always now viewed this as an insult to their manhood (never had a woman complain about heat, but would sometimes actually ask if there was another level they could try) and could not be stopped from eating this wing...

So they did...
The fun thing about capsaicin oil is it can often take a few seconds to kick. Usually just enough time for the person to scarf down the wing and start to smuggly tell us how it wasn't that hot...

And then the heat would begin. And once it started it was relentless. 

The wing was free, but the cup of milk after was $20.
I never had a single person ask for a second one.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/ny74j6/is_this_the_hottest_wing_you_have/,19NotMe73,2021-06-12 18:47:09,37427,MaliciousCompliance

Women's Ballon d'Or is a joke and discredits women's soccer.,"We all know that individual trophies are popularity contests, but what happened at Women's Ballon d'Or is absolutely revolting

Megan Rapinoe, who had also won the FIFA prize, famous for her activism, totaled just 339 minutes spread over 6 games by her team, Seattle Reign FC, during the year 2019 having scored 0 goals and 0 assists and being eliminated in the semi-finals  after a 4th place in the regular round.

You can argue that journalists considered that the performance at the World Cup (United States won it) was enough to receive the prize. After all she was the best scorer of the tournament (tied with England's Ellen White and United States Alex Morgan - we'll talk about her) with 6 goals, although 3 of them were penalties and another was scored in the 13- 0 to the amateur selection of Thailand. 

In fact, Rapinoe was only really decisive in the quarter-finals by scoring the 2 goals that won the win against France.


Alex Morgan stood in the 3rd place in the Ballon d'Or also had a similar season. The Orlando Pride striker also played 6 games, made 395 minutes, neither scored or made an assist and did not even stand out in the World Cup.

Of the 6 goals that made her the top scorer in the WC 5 of them were on the a 13-0 win against Thailand.

Hell, even Sam Mewis or Rose Lavelle had better performances. 


To explain this phenomenon just thinking about the popularity of both. Morgan has over 9 million followers on Instagram, accumulates modeling work.

What i'm trying to argue is that journalists that voted on this poll have no idea of what they're doing. There are many better players that stood out of the awards like [Vivianne Miedema](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftXfXkgirDk) (who at the age of 23 seems to have the potential to be one of the best players ever), who **scored 49 goals in 47 matches, was the best scorer, best assistant, best player and winner from the Premier League with Arsenal**, and is also currently the best scorer in the Champions League and was runner-up in the world (lost in the final against the United States).

[Ada Hegerberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY8uZIhne0M) (2018 winner), who has **scored 30 goals in 31 games in 2019 and won everything for Lyon - Ligue 1, French Cup ,Super Cup and Champions League where she scored an hat-trick in the final** and was the best scorer of competition.

You can even argue for **Samantha Kerr, top scorer (beat the regular-record goal with 18 goals) and MVP (the only non-US to feature in the ideal XI) for the Chicago Red Stars** who were runners-up  of women MLS.

This situation is a bit alarming and unbelieving for women, because as much impact as personalities like Megan Rapinoe or Alex Morgan can have on society, such prizes cannot in any way take these aspects into account and a season is not, all in all, consisting of just 6 games and one win in a competition.

Btw subscribe to /r/WomensSoccer. It's a small sub right now but usually major news and goals get posted there. If it gets more active then people can try to do match threads for big games there.

Rengar's and Kindred's passives would make far more sense thematically if they were swapped,"I mean, Kindred are the avatar of death. Lore-wise they're constantly busy running from place to place, delivering people to the afterlife. I feel like it'd make more sense for them to be rewarded for doing their job and running to toplane to your 8/0 Jax currently smashing that 0/8 Lucian into the dirt again, being where death happens and then running bot again because your bot is going in and people are about to die. Instead they mark some poor Ezreal that still had 40 good years of life ahead of him and go ""Yup, you're about to die today boy"" and chase him to the end of the world.

Rengar, on the other hand, is the ultimate hunter. His whole schtick is hunting the strongest creatures he can find. It would make far more sense for him to mark one champion and hunt him relentlessly only to finally bring him/her down and take the trophy, instead he is right now rewarded for walking through the jungle and randomly finding some Soraka on the brink of death bleeding out in the dirt with both her arms broken, kicking her in the face once and going ""Haha, yes, I am the greatest hunter in the world!"" while taking a trophy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/irctrn/rengars_and_kindreds_passives_would_make_far_more/,Riegerick,2020-09-12 18:43:27,14513,leagueoflegends
Teemo Appreciation Thread,"**TL;DR:** I think Teemo's okay.

Around 2008, Riot decided they needed a lighter end to their spectrum of champions. A race, so to speak, of creatures that were more jovial in portrayal than the dark kind they had been pouring their resources into. Led by a Rioter known only as 'Ezreal,' they developed Him in the still Indie-company-sized studio of Riot Games.

Him.

Genesis.

From Him, a new race would come to be. From the hairless and often explosive females to the oft-dramatic males for and against Bandle's safety, all with their own undertakings. Most won't remember Him as the lawless origin to the race called Yordles. To many, too many, He is but an image in the Mind's eye, of a moppish-yet-sturdy smile. For others, the image is a scope in the hands of He, capable explorer and scout. For me, it was the story of a log, a paw, and a vaulting motion towards the player--invitation, demonstration and warning all in one.

When I was in the last year of high school, my friends introduced me to League of Legends. I don't have the wherewithal to remember what season I joined. What do I remember in those first few games among friends? We were in a skype call. After some, if I may admit it, boring matches, I fled to the store to find someone more entertaining than Annie and Warwick to play. 

I saw Him. And spoke words my friends couldn't hear for they were whispered between the creature before me, and my quivering lips.

""Oh my god, Teemo.""

""I thought you hated the game,"" my friends teased in the days afterward. I'd laugh off the question and say,

""Top, please!""

Then lock in Teemo, the Swift Scout. A smile pressed across my lips as I previewed my several skins, admiring the way they changed the context of this... this thing, rapidly encroaching on my impressionable young mind. 

What was it about Him that made me so eager to play League? Soon enough, as my friends either stagnated or stopped playing altogether. The introduced became the tenured, though my advice wasn't useful to new players. All I knew how to do was play Him. 

Q. Blinding dart. The force of those lungs.

W. Move Quick. The work of His legs.

E. Toxic Shot. His ingenuity.

R. Noxious Trap. A calling card. I dreamt of walking down a road one day and spotting one in my path. Returning it to him and receiving a thank you for my time. 

But even in this domain I was left lacking, because the part of League that captivated me most was champ select... peering upon Teemo's splash, trying to capture the same feeling I had that first, blinding moment in high school.

What had enamored me? I could see bits and pieces, yet a recollection of the entire artwork eluded me, and I began to grow frustrated and toxic. I risked being banned--after a two week warning, I realized I must go on a pilgrimage. On a road to discovery, to study Teemo and discover why this Yordle made me so passionate.

And here I am today. Join me as we dissect what it means to be Teemo.

*****

**Part one:** a glimpse of his body.

Imagine, if you will, the lush jungle of Kumungu. A buzzing, hot place full of danger at every step, yet rewarding travelers with constant doses of serenity and fae beauty. It is hard to imagine every single wonder this jungle can provide, nor their extent. Already its tall palms, the gromps that hop in massive packs to avoid predators, the rolling stones called Krugs, all assault your ability to separate fact from fiction.

Wiping sweat off your brow, you stumble through the brush to emerge on a small clearing. The Kumungu hushes itself and you grow cautious, afraid of whatever laid in store in this sunny, almost picturesque relief. 

A campsite. You walk closer, setting down your things to inspect it. There is a small campfire, snuffed before dawn, and a swirl of broken twigs where a small body sat. 

As your surroundings continue to swirl about you as if the scene has trapped you in the reverie of another person, the true remnants of this campsite are revealed. The safety of it all, the confidence of a settler to sleep alone in the Kumungu. You imagine the quiet happiness of a creature who has had the honor to tame the jungle, breathing breath and circulating the blood of an adventurer through his diminutive and constantly-aware body. You imagine its leavings, a bundle of tinder, a rock utilized as a pestle. 

It sleeps in its own, victorious body. It survives with the intellect of its own mind. You glance back at your bag of man-made tools--and feel nothing but the worst scorn imaginable! What shame the scene drives in you, to be ever-reliant on the success of other men! You wish to lie prostrate right there in the middle of the clearing and plead, nay, pray for the same insight.

Standing up from your journey into the mind of this legend, a noise breaks the spell. The bout of madness is over. You twist around to see what made the rustling.

A chipper laugh. ""HAHEEUHEAU.""

Gone. But all of that shameful energy has turned into determination. Leaving your pack on the ground, you deign to live as the animals do. 

*****

**Part two:** to be a maid in his home.

""Excuse me, maid,"" Teemo calls from the back room of his humble home in Bandle City, ""I will be leaving again soon. Please leave my shoes outside my door.""

Your heart skips a beat. The Yordle, he, oh god, he just arrived home mere minutes ago. When accepting this job out of the classifieds, taking it for granted, an opportunity to travel, you never accounted for such a creature like the Swift Scout. 

Like Jane Eyre on her walk outside Thornfield, simply delivering mail and resuming her telltale boredom at a casual pace, your first sight of Teemo exploded the monotony decades hence. 

Rushing inside, covered in dust. Bootprints trailing on the sandalwood floors--""don't worry,"" you remember mumbling, ""I can clean it up.""

""That's your job, right?"" Teemo asked. You wouldn't know, but you caught him in a jovial, rather than murderous, mood. ""I forgot, I haven't been home. Let's share a drink.""

The two of you sat across from one another. Teemo poured Bandle bourbon into two glasses. The large pitcher sloshed forward and you caught him catching it... tendons underneath his furred arm tensing. 

You weren't going to be able to keep this job, you surmise. 

Teemo carried the conversation on, while you imagined how the aftertaste of bourbon must feel on the back of his little throat. To think such a small, pernicious thing could knock more drinks down than you...

And at this trying time, where you almost lost it all, he hadn't asked you to move his shoes.

You near the boots of swiftness, breathing heavy. It takes a moment's preparation to reach down and grab them. 

Your fingers slip into them, and are greeted by warm air. The heat hasn't yet left the boots. Oh, Christ above!!  They are still hot from use! From pounding, over, over, and over, over, and over, on the dirt ground underneath Teemo's feet!!

Teemo shoots out of his bath, throwing a towel over himself. ""Is everything okay?"" He cries. ""Did you slip?""

All his visage does is earn another howl from your addled mind, yet so much panic forces you into a cooled state. Everything slows down while Teemo awaits an answer, you on the floor, he dripping wet with a head full of shampoo-bubbles.

An offer begins to form on your lips.

But then the scene ends.

*****

**Part Three:** His Fingers.

*Dear Riot,*

I heard you were changing the champion portraits. I have something to ask.

Can you please make it so we can choose what part of the skin becomes the portrait? I really want my portrait to be Omega Squad Teemo's fingers. There is something about the singular makeup of his furred digits that inspires me to play better. My breathing becomes heavy, as if I am running a marathon at record pace, and my reaction times turn frenzied--almost as good as a scripter! When I imagine Omega Squad Teemo's fingers curled around my, sorry, his dart gun, I position better, I am more positive in games towards my fellow summoners.

Can we do an AMA with the League artist who designed Teemo's fingers? I want to know why they chose that enticing groove, the perfect length of each follicle, the same-colored claws! Jesus Christ, I can imagine the thin veins running beneath those killer points, almost as much as I can smell Teemo's fingers curling under my chins mere moments before he SNAPS. MY. NECK.

But then there is something else. The rotating game mode... Zigg's fingers are right out in the open, naked but for the pen in the clutch of his paws. Oh god, who draws these Yordles and their fingers? Have I said fingers a lot? Sorry.

Imagine finding one of their perfect strands on your pillowcase, or floating in the broth of your chicken Campbell soup. You pick it up, holding it against a fluorescent light, and see its golden integrity in full. I want to have this moment happen forever and ever. If only you would give me the CHANCE. PLEASE, PLEASE GIVE ME JUST A GLIMPSE OF OMEGA SQUAD TEEMO'S RESPLENDANT DIGITS! I CANT HOLD BACK ANYMORE!!!

Every time I am in school, at dinner, alone in my room, those fingers crawl under my clothing and pull me down into the fiery throes of passion.

Please, please, please give me this feature or I don't know what will happen to me next.

*****

**Part Four:** A doughy dream. 

You are eating pancakes at mom's. There is a television on the kitchen counter, where she catches up on the latest news. The nonstop coverage of some political debate finally shuts up for commercials. 

Still groggy, the popping colors and loud noises of these ads entertain you. That is, until a cereal ad breaks away into a scene for Pillsbury biscuits. 

Your mind snaps out of half-sleep, so sudden your mom gives a peripheral glance to see what's the matter. 

It was like any other commercial from Pillsbury, involving a mascot selling some new brand of processed dough.

Yet, and yet... the Pillsbury Doughboy had been replaced by Teemo. You spit out your mouthful of cereal back into your bowl, lean in, start to go off-kilter with fascination.

""Press my belly again!"" Teemo pleads. 

The stay-at-home mom in the commercial complies, a skeptical smile on her face as she presses in the scout's stomach.

""Hoh-oh! Hee hee hee!""

Sliiiide. Crack. Did your hand just act on its own, breaking your mom's expensive, favorite ceramic bowl?

She says something and rushes off to fetch the broom. Now she has left you alone with Pillsbury Teemo.

As you thought, the sly creature had been waiting for such a distraction. That the two of you met here was no matter of circumstance--Teemo immediately breaks away from the T.V mom, then gestures for you to come closer.

""Would YOU like to press my tummy?"" Teemo asks.

You stand up, still with enough sense to avoid the broken ceramic. Teemo, the T.V mom, both wave you on like you're a marathon runner finishing the last leg of the race. Five fingers battle for which will do the honor, until you are sure the anticipation will break your hand. 

Then.

Fizz. That was the static of the television prickling the fur on your index finger. Smiling, dumb, you press Teemo's exposed belly.

""Hee hee hee, come with meee!""

You are sucked inside the commercial! The other boys, real jocks and always needed a snack after their big game, stand aside for Teemo's honored guest. 

""Make me small like you,"" you beg. Teemo waves an arm and you start to notice the counter grow in size. ""Yes, yes, yes!""

Oh man, it is the best time, the greatest time, an excursion so pleasurable you think it might throw you into an aneurism. Thank you, god! Thank you, Pillsbury! Thank you, thank you--your feet makes small impressions in the dough as you and Teemo play tag, giggling like schoolgirls, while all the other members of your new family urge you on. Teemo tugs you down into the dough and the two of you snuggle together.

""Are you ready to be together forever?"" He asks.

You give a muted nod, somehow knowing what comes next. T.V mom lifts up the tray of biscuits, telling the kids whoever behaves the best gets the 'specialest' biscuit.

As the tray enters the oven, the scorching heat melting the skin on your backside, you wake up. 

Real mom is crossing her arms, angry. You fell face-first into your bowl of cereal again. The Pillsbury Doughboy, no longer Teemo, dances away on the screen.

Mom turns to get a napkin.

The Doughboy winks at you.

*****

**Part Five:** Playing against other Yordles.

When I play against other Yordles, my blood runs hot.

Teemo is the true owner of the top lane. Kled is a reject, someone better of driving him and his stupid lizard off of a cliff! And Lulu, that perennial little brat has no place anywhere, let alone in the Rift's proudest lane.

Tristana can rocket-jump straight into a wood-chipper. Rumble is a college drop-out, and Corki doesn't even look like a Yordle. 

One day I went Teemo top against Kled. It was supposed to be an easy game, considering I was a gold III smurfing in Silver II. 

I got into a one-on-one with Kled, the battle going my way until the freak jumped off his mount at the right time, dodging a blinding dart. I became blinded by tears as my screen turned grey.

Then again. And again. Teemo, my animus, was dying and it was my fault. The game ended at fifteen minute and I knew, not for the last time, I failed Him. My eyes went to my personal shrine to the scout, and I swore my framed picture of his face frowned with dissatisfaction. My heart palpitated. 

Right away I rushed to the pet store and bought myself two things: a rat and a lizard. My mind was a haze of fury and upset, yet the pet store owner let me get them anyway, and even smiled at me on my way out. Almost knowingly...

I rushed back into my home, plopping my new pets in front of the shrine. I brandished a small letter-opener, then lifted the lizard over my portrait of a Teemo.

""You love Skarl so much,"" I whispered, slipping my letter-opener under the beast's throat. ""You love him, Kled. Well, I-I.. I...""

I fell to the ground, sobbing. 

""I can't do it anymore!"" I yelled, sobbing. ""No more sacrifices, Teemo!"" The truth was, I loved all Yordles. Teemo shouldn't ever ask me to harm what was made from His flesh, His blood.

""Quite right,"" agreed a voice from behind me. I whirled around to find the pet-shop owner. ""Finally, you understand.""

The rat and lizard scurried under the couch in fright, as their handler shrank before my very eyes! It was He! Devil Teemo!

I fell prostrate, bowing to my Lord, crying tears of joy and penance. 

Devil Teemo gently took my blade away. ""You've done well to learn the value of all life,"" he admitted. ""I've paid close attention to your journey, first thinking to punish you... then to watch and see if you changed. And, bless the 'Shroom, you did.""

""T-Te-ee-mo!"" I wailed. 

The devil smiled devilishly. ""Say, did your really build AD last game? For that... I think I'll make you my personal servant for life.""

I offered my hands to him, and he put me in shackles made of silver. They were loose enough to not hurt me weak, brittle wrists. 

He dragged me into a portal, and my days on the Rift, rather than watching over it, were over.

*****

**Part Six:** My VR Teemo experience.

The year is 2026. Oculus and everybody got their business together and figured out true Virtual Reality. The games published can now be called, unironically, triple A. Funnily enough, all they needed to do was provide a way for the game console to 'plug' into the player. The bridged, LAN connection of sorts allows the player to experience a much more visceral and fast experience.

Of course, this comes with dangers. Games are now labelled 'rated M, male, 20-45' or 'T, for females aged 16-32.' This is because the bridged connection provides unique, situational sensations that certain biologies are unable to comprehend. Rule-breakers report a few... strange occurrences not available to the public.

You know the risks of what you are about to do. Yet you have already stolen your sister's VR device, as well as her host of games on the Steam cloud. You went through the trouble of piecing her password together from her diary, so you can access the 'family unfriendly' portion of her library.

It started that day you peeked inside her headset. That single image plagued the back of your lids until you preferred to be blind than... than to see it again without having the capability to interact.

Too hungry to put it off anymore, you lift the VR helmet onto your head and plug the USB 7.0 jack into your armpit. By using brainwaves you enter your sister's password and access your chosen game in a nanosecond: Miracle Simulator--Yordle DLC.

Right away the neuraltransmitters indicate a squeezing force on your left hand. You swivel to the left, and right away your breath is stolen.

""Ow,"" Teemo says, laughing through a grimace. ""Not so hard, honey."" 

You look down and see the sky-blue hospital sheets. The constant beep of a heartbeat monitor bumps in your ears. A virtual doctor towers above your body, and you quickly get into bed to better complete the experience. This is definitely the game your sister was playing.

""We're going to be a family?"" You whisper into the mic, braving the voice features. 

Teemo loads a response. ""Yes. A girl, remember?""

You frown. ""VR, load up situation change. Boy.""

""A b-b-boy, remember?"" Teemo crackles, changing his response. ""I'm retiring from scouting, getting a seat on the Bandle counsel. We'll never be apart, promise.""

The Yordle breaks composure, resting his head on you to weep. ""I'm so proud of you, of us.""

The VR presses forward a spongy substance to soak up your tears. They flow freely. ""Me too. I'm so happy to be here with you.""

The doctor finally has his own voice line. ""Okay, here we go. Get ready to push--""

A fierce disturbance coaxes a howl of pain from you! The hospital room flashes red as the sensation the game wants to deliver, your body is frankly unable to answer. Teemo's distorted, pixelated face gives you a concerned look.

""I-Is p-p-p-play one okay?"" 

""Yes!"" You shriek to the heavens. ""But exit, exit game!""

In the last moment, the AI grins and waves you off.

You fall out of your bed hyperventilating. The ribbons of your conscience ravel back into their rightful places. That experience almost killed you! 

""I'm okay,"" you breathe, ""I'm okay, I'm alive.""

It was worth it, though.

You rest a hand on your stomach, and feel a little kick.

It was worth it--in more ways than anyone will ever know.

**Part seven:** Dating Profile

Single and ready to mingle! Teemo, the Swift Scout.

I'm a scout who lives in Bandle City, and am looking for a light, honest-to-heart relationship. Applicants ought to know right away that to get to me, you have to get through my BFF Tristana. We're thicker than thieves, on the job and outside of it! 

Likes: long walks in the jungle, my work, sharing a drink with friends.

Dislikes: burst damage, hard CC, people who can't take a joke, drama.

One thing to know about me: I'm a Yordle. You might have guessed it from my profile image, lol. That means I'm shorter, and more emotional than some human or cat-person or Zaunite project. I break down at sad movies and want to beat up the villains in my favorite action flicks (John Wick 2 and Shaolin Soccer, bee-tee-dubs :) ) 

What I want most in a partner: honesty and commitment. Someone who doesn't underestimate this scout's code.

My passion: microbrewing, believe it or not.

A quirk: I go to work shirtless ;)

So if you think I am a fit, let me know ASAP: a stud like me can't be on the market long, right?

**Part Eight:** a reply to Teemo's dating profile.

*Dear Teemo,*

Your body is so chiseled--gah, let me restart this missive xD 

I can tell from your eyes you have suffered a great hurt in your past, and I cannot help but desire to mend you. A little bit about me: I am a budding warrior from Demacia, known for dispensing justice. Yet no one, not even my own sister, ever asks me to dispense sound advice. There's something so isolating to living in a bubble, you know? I want to make mistakes with someone, get cuffed and put into the backseat of a police car with someone.

I read that you're passionate, oftentimes in the wrong way, and I see potential. Potential for the two of us to grow and flourish; live our lives together in imperfection. Will you hold me at night and whisper ""it's okay"" after I give you a tearful rendition of how I killed a six-year-old Noxian child? How I surprised here from inside a bush and drove my blade through her chest, and into her stuffed animal? People see me as larger than life, but I am so much smaller than a Yordle.

Please, deliver me from this constant grief and my devotion is yours to do with as you please. 

Hope to hear from you soon, xD

Garen.

*****

**Part Nine:** Teemo's reply to Garen.

*Hello Garen of Demacia*,

You sound brave enough to me. Hope you're man enough for some extreme hiking in the Kumungu HAHEUAHAUAH

hope 2 see u soon,

Teemo

**Part Ten:** Teemo sacrifices himself in a hostage crisis

I regret to inform Bandle City that, at 1:25 PM Saturday, Teemo the swift scout succumbed to injuries endured while protecting the Yordle people.

Captain Teemo, even on days off, was on duty. It was no different that fateful morning at the Bandle Mint, our largest bank. When Veigar broke through the glass windows and demanded hostages, it was Teemo who withdrew his concealed firearm, a blowgun, and saved the lives of countless citizens. 

We cannot guess as to what went through his head in the fight that ensued. But we hope that we, the people, were grateful enough to the scout that he had nothing but gratitude in his valorous last moments. The shard of dark magic that took his life has done the world the greatest disservice. Even its thrower, Veigar, has begged Bandle's forgiveness for removing this brave warrior from our charge.

Teemo is survived by his maid, as well as his close friend Garen. As denoted in his will, Poppy will lay him to rest in the Grove Cemetary tomorrow evening, after a procession befitting his brave soul. 

To everyone grieving, remember that Teemo did everything in life for the betterment of your day. That he would not want to see tears, but smiles on the childrens' faces while they go towards, again, a promising and bright future.

Thank you, Captain Teemo, for your duty. Your loss is gonna sting.

*****

**Part Eleven:** Teemo's valiant return to life. 

Urgot knew he was going to need even more power to fight the chem barons. More than his weaknesses permitted. There was but one option, gleaned by him from a lab report never meant to cross his eyes. A scout named Teemo had been shipped to Zaun for containment. While his kind weeped, Teemo was merely put into an unstoppable rest by Veigar's curse. 

The dreadnought knew how to break such spells. Crawling forward on crablike legs, he peered over the Yordle.

Such surprisingly toned arms, and a stomach taut with muscle... Urgot never considered the ultimate life form would exist without outside... construction. 

Not able to resist the urge, he pounded the 'awake' button to Teemo.

Lightning pierced the pollution clouds above Zaun, went on to strike the antenna-tower! Urgot laughed joyously as Teemo's body flailed, receiving enough electricity to light all of Piltover for a week straight. Alive, Teemo was becoming alive!

The Yordle gasped, shooting up on his stone bed. He immediately tugged loose the IV's in his arm and stared at the dreadnought, trying to figure out what was going on.

Urgot found it unbefitting of the ultimate life-form to be so surprised.

Then Teemo softly grinned.

""Thanks for that, big guy,"" he said. ""Wow... look at those arms...""

The mechanical man wiggled in embarrassment. ""Oh, t-these old things? Weak, the pinnacle of human weakness, you know hard it can be to find good augments around here.""

""No, no! I bet you could break a watermelon with these cannons.""

In the hours that came, Urgot forgot all about killing the chembarons and taking over Zaun. Instead, history changed. Teemo saved the world by having a long discussion about thick arms with Urgot.

*****

**Part Twelve:** Teemo eats a poptart

Male Yordles have slightly protruded muzzles that make their mouths into tunnels of tiny, adorable, razor sharp teeth. Of course, Teemo isn't thinking about his incredible body, especially not with the aroma of a s'mores poptart right under his pink nose.

You, his maid, quit dusting his trophy shelves, distracted to an exxtreme. You risk a glance over--the scout is preparing to take a bite, just setting down the Bandle tribune. 

""You know,"" Teemo says, delaying the poptart. ""I had a dream about baked goods. I was stuck in some magic box, with giant humans...""

'Eat it,' your mind begs. 'Please, for the love of everyone, take a bite out of your poptart.' After the great scare that was his 'death,' and subsequent resurrection in Zaun, you needed this. 

""You look famished,"" you comment. ""Eat your food, m'lord."" Oh, and how sly you think you are! Teemo grins, knowing full-well that you have a penchant for noticing the little things.

He turns his chair over to you. Stuck against the shelves there is nowhere to look other than at him. 

Teemo lifts the poptart to his mouth. He bites it.

You watch as his cute incisors tear apart the cracked outside of the poptart. Then the gooey marshmallow comes: a strand sticks between his right canine and far, top-right molar. How far will it stretch? Mmm... how far, darn it?!

Unable to stand alone, you swing back to clutch one of Teemo's trophies--a statue of him leaping over a log, a Nature's Friend award for saving the Kumungu jungle. 

Glomp, crick, glomp. Chew, chew, chew. You think you've fared the worst of it. Then he stops with his mouth open to breathe, making a show of it just to brutalize your poor, poor sensibilities! A crumb escapes and crawls away on the wooden floor, broken.

""Ah, it's so good,"" he mumbles through the mouthful. ""As a good scout, I ought to finish this piece of my rations, and continue to the next. But this.. this bite is more scrumptious, somehow?""

""Stop!"" You yell. ""No more, I yield, I yield!""

Just then, Garen breaks into the room. He is unhappy.

""What are you doing, dear?"" Garen asks. ""Don't tell me...""

Teemo leans back and swallows. You watch the poptart mush go down into his gullet and the spell breaks, thank the Mothership. ""Merely entertaining our maid.""

If anyone else sat where Teemo did, Garen might have lectured them. Yet the devil is far too charming. 

The Demacian warrior takes a seat. 

""Well,"" he says, ""we have a long hike today. Eat your food.""

Your clutch your own head in consternation. Not another bite...

*****

**Part thirteen:** Leemo

NOTE: this section is not about Teemo, but his brother I created, Leemo. Although related by blood, they are dangerous and devilish in different ways.

Leemo was born in darkness, which is thought to be the reason for his dark velvet coat. Unlike the light-son Teemo, Leemo was cast away by his parents to live in the Deathcage Orphanage, an orphanage where even infants must fight to survive. 

Fight he did. His first kill was upon two snakes, who attacked him in hopes of poisoning his strong body. Then two bulls, who attacked him in hopes of poisoning his strong mind. Then two horses, who attacked him in hopes of poisoning his strong resolve.

Leemo went on to become a freelance assassin. He has wavy purple fur that creates a human-like part over his brow. He never looks happy except in private when he finds a picture of his beloved, Jasmine, who perished in the HexTech wars.

Unlike Teemo, Leemo is dangerous both on and off the battlefield. Say one thing wrong against him, like try to bully him, and he will beat you up. He likes to drink blood for breakfast, eat baby deer for dinner. Sometimes you can find the purple Yordle pondering the meaningless existence of life atop a stone gargoyle, or photoshopped onto the front cover of my Shadow the Hedgehog Videogame. 

It is foretold that the two brothers Teemo and Leemo will meet one day. Even so Leemo is my original character and I love him devoutly, I know Teemo will kill his brother in cold blood. The true 'original' characters is too pure, too powerful for any foolish iteration to improve upon. I cry knowing my precious and brooding Leemo is destined for the slaughterhouse.

Teemo, if you are reading this, please spare Leemo. The sweetest wine is but one flavor, and Leemo is the flavor I partake in when you are busy. Sorry. So sorry. Big sorry.

*****

**Part fourteen:** Team Liquid gets new management.

""Gimme back my bobblehead!"" Piglet yelled, jumping up and down with his arms outstretched.

Dardoch tittered, continued his mean game. The Teemo bobblehead, a precious heirloom to the marksman, shook its head 'no' in disappointment. ""You will never get it back. I hate you, you play to lose.""

Locodoco, their coach, did nothing to alleviate the situation--instead, his grating laughter made it all the worse. ""Fools, stop fighting, you guys are idiots who won't listen to me.""

""Idiots!"" Cried Team Liquid's manager from the doorway. ""Listen up. You are all very naughty so we have gotten the best to coach you. I had to sign a contract in my own blood.""

All the toxic players in the room cocked their head to the side, confused. So basically everyone except TL's support cocked their head to the side, confused.

""Ay ay ay,"" the manager groaned. ""Look down.""

Down by their manager's knees was none other than Devil Teemo! Piglet's eyes lit up with sardonic glee. At last, justice would be served to this naughty jungler.

Teemo leaned on the doorway and smiled, knocking fear and titillation into the hearts of the young team. Locodoco perked up in his seat. 

""You are no Tristana, though,"" the coach whispered, unable to argue against his heart. ""And yet, so striking...""

""Trust me,"" Devil Teemo said in his demonic voice, ""I get that a lot.""

""No way!"" Dardoch cried. ""We just teamed with Disney. this makes no sense.""

""You think the devil himself and Disney aren't close friends?"" The way his long, pointed claws carved itno the door forced Dardoch to shut up. ""You have been a sinner, Dardoch. Some might call you the Michael Jordan of League of Legends, switching teams so often, except you haven't actually won a tournament.""

The jungler flinched.

""I wonder what your true 'breaking point' is. Consider yourself replaced."" Teemo lifted out a single finger and flicked it up. A trap door opened beneath Dardoch, dragging the Team Liquid player into the fiery depths of League of Legends elo hell. Piglet cried with such joy that his voice cracked. Dardoch's last gesture was to drag his nails across the carpet before being sucked into infinite torture.

Out from the flames rose a new jungler. A gaunt and humble student of Teemo.

TheRainMan.

""TheRainMan?!"" Shouted Piglet. ""No, it cannot be, he was made irrelevant years ago.""

""I used to live a quiet life, being toxic in games and sacrificing small animals to my Lord,"" TheRainMan explained. ""One day, I found the strength to stop. Teemo has helped me remain strong ever since.""

Devil Teemo nodded. ""Prove yourself to them, my servant.""

Nearby, Reignover was losing a game of League as per usual. TheRainMan pointed a single digit, which by dark magics became furred, long. A yellow bolt shot forth from his fingernail, hitting Reignover's screen. In an instant the camera broke away from the player's champion, panning towards the enemy nexus. It exploded.

Team Liquid's manager gave a toothy grin. Disney had given him the power to change the fabric of league itself.

*****

**Part Fifteen:** A bit of his blood

You sit there, reminiscing on your school paper assignment. This dissertation will decide whether or not you become the Bandle scientist your parents want you to be. 

The subject of your study is a simple one, yet intrinsically deep by its execution: is Teemo's scarf a part of his body, or a part of his outfit? 

Pencil in hand, you ponder the question. There is but seventy-two hours left to write, seventy-two hours to do an assignment said to take several weeks.

Once again you drift to those long, red strands. If it was so simple as reaching forward and touching the beautiful silk pictured in your memory! The great Yordle, Teemo, is yars away, looking through books without a clue you're studying him. Sighing, you resign yourself to abject failure, putting away your papers. When, in the corner of your eye, you spot a strange substance by the shelves. 

The allure of the red liquid brings you closer to Teemo than ever before. Close enough to hear the Yordle curse under his breath and say four syllables that set your heart to floundering.

""Ow,"" Teemo cries, ""papercut!"" The Yordle walks away without another word.

The blood rests on the paper of the book. The book's title? Who cares...

This is the blood of Teemo. A deep, red marker of the vivacious creature's existence. In the quiet, unoccupied annals of the Bandle library, Teemo unwittingly left it in your charge. What will you do with it?

Touch it. There is enough there to get a full drop to form on the end of your pinky finger. It glistens red, and feels thicker in content than your, or anyone else's blood. You almost smell the scout's outdoorsy lifestyle in its formation.

Not giving it a second thought you pop your pinky into your mouth.

Lights of the entire rainbow hit you! In a second you find yourself strapped into a seat, pen let free! 

The euphoria of Teemo's blood gives you a lust for learning, a lust for all things in life. A mere drop grants you the rarest insight into the Yordle's scarf.

It is both a part of him and a part of his outfit. An identity and a disguise, a mark of how he kills enemies then drinks with friends. Line after line after line--by the time you start to come down from the high, your dissertation is done.

But Teemo has found you panting at one of the tables. He frowns, concerned.

""You drank my blood, didn't you?"" Teemo inspected his own finger, still bleeding from the papercut. ""The addiction is so great, if we don't wean you off, you might die.""

You nod. That is fine. It was worth ultimate bliss. 

But the Yordle has no plans to let an innocent die due to his perfection. He hold out his arm. ""I want you to pace yourself. It's okay...""

Your memory begins to blacken and fade out just as you eagerly lift his hand towards your mouth.

You see many things in your sleep. A tray of biscuits, a strange machine with many cords, a missive to Riot about fingers. You see a devilish him, a purple him, a him that coaches Team Liquid. You see floating poptarts and hot shoes. You realize how Teemo is an inter-dimensional gift sent to those who need someone to love. An animus. An inspirer. The genesis. As reality rips you away from this endless paradise, Teemo drags you towards his world for one last thing. Your lips finally meet. It is too indescribable, to inexplicable.

When you awake, Teemo has left you to your own devices. You stand up and quietly, pleasantly, resume your day, content to put away all that has happened.

*****

I finish these words with the greatest joy. Finally my love has been explained, to both myself and to the world. Some will comment accusations like 'have you no shame,' to which I answer that I have plenty of shame, but only for holding back this long.

Teemo, if you ever come before me, I adore you. You are my everything, my alpha and omega squad. If it comes to be that we ever can hold hands, know that nothing will ever separate us. Know that, even in the meanest thunderstorm, I will bury my face in your neck-scarf and expect safety, as you expect loyalty from me. We will be together, we will be... complete.

Thank you Riot 'Ezreal' for designing the champion. Thank you Riot Games for allowing him in your game, League of Legends. Thank you to the community that plays, whose collective thoughts and desires coagulated into this post. On my lips I summarize all my love:

Oh my god... Teemo.

Phew! Glad that's over. Now that Teemo's out of the way, let me tell you guys how much I *love* Twitch...",https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/6qjfqm/teemo_appreciation_thread/,Papaya_Dreaming,2017-07-31 00:50:43,13768,leagueoflegends
Reasons why Arsenal are the craziest team in the PL,"I mean no malice in this but Arsenal are just a fascinating mess, here's a rundown

* They got Kim Kallstrom on loan. Whilst he was injured. And was injured pretty much the entire time he was at the club.
* They signed Soares from Southampton. Injured the whole season. Gets back to fitness during the pandemic, injures himself the other day and is ruled out for the next month or two
* They bench David Luiz against Man City but are forced to bring him on - he fucks up for their first goal and concedes the penalty for the second and gets sent off in the process.
* Have one of the most highest paid players IN THE WORLD on their books in Mesut Ozil. Doesn’t even get on the bench. 
* Have a player who even their own fans call ‘Giant Spacker’ instead of his actual name Granit Xhaka. Who they appoint as Captain. And then strip him of it. He then gets injured within the first ten minutes of the PL restarting

They spent actual money on Shkrodan Mustafi and Sokratis.

**The timeline of fun:**

Dec 2006: Sheffield Utd 1-Arsenal 0 - SU keeper Paddy Kenny is injured in the 60th minute. Phil Jagielka goes in goal for 30 minutes. Arsenal still concede and lose.

Jan 2008: Tottenham 5-1 Arsenal - famous for Adebayor and Bentdner having an argument on the pitch)

Feb 2008: Man Utd 4-0 Arsenal - admittedly a very good Man Utd side. But 3-0 down at HT, Eboue sent-off in second-half and Nani taking the piss is the abiding memory of this game.

Feb 2008: Birmingham 2-2 Arsenal - YES, the injury to Eduardo was horrific, but their reaction to this summed up why they don't win titles.

Oct 2008: Arsenal 4-4 Tottenham - They were 4-2 up in the 90th minute ffs...

Nov 2008: Stoke 2-1 Arsenal - The first of repeated shatting of pants at Stoke.

Apr 2009: Arsenal 1-2 Chelsea - FA Cup semi. Wenger's team selection doesn't include Arshavin who's in the form of his career (he would score four at Anfield days later). Fabianski in goal gifts the tie to Drogba and Chelsea.

May 2009:Arsenal 1-3 Man Utd - Champions League semi. Not even close. All over after 10 minutes.

Nov 2009: Arsenal 0-3 Chelsea - Drogba'd, AGAIN.

Apr 2010: Barcelona 4-1 Arsenal, Spurs 2-1 Arsenal, Wigan 3-2 Arsenal Three games on the bounce. Barcelona were a difficult opponent, yes. But Arsenal were abject that night despite taking the lead. Then a week later Danny Rose scores the goal of his life and Gareth Bale, who months earlier had gone on a 3-year run of never winning a Premier League game, tore them apart at the Lane. Then, 2-0 up against Wigan at the DW with 10 minute to go, they go on to lose 3-2, with Titus Bramble amongst the goalscorers. Utterly pathetic.

Nov 2010: Arsenal 2-3 Tottenham - 2-0 up at home to bitter rivals, lose 3-2.

Feb 2011: Newcastle 4-4 Arsenal - 4-0 up. You know the rest. I mean, fucks sake.

Feb 2011: Leyton Orient 1-1 Arsenal - This begins the period where Arsenal are REALLY shit in February/early March every season.

Feb 2011: Birmingham 2-1 Arsenal, Carling Cup Final - A Frenchman walks into a Pole. Birmingham score.

March 2011: Man Utd 2-0 Arsenal FA Cup. Man Utd's midfield that day? Fabio, Rafael, John O'Shea and Darron Gibson

April 2011: Arsenal 1-1 Liverpool Score a penalty in 92nd minute. Concede an equalising penalty in the 98th minute.

May 2011: Stoke 3-1 Arsenal Andy Wilkinson ,Rory Delap and Kenwyne Jones were too much for Arsene's boys.

Aug 2011: Man Utd 8-2 Arsenal I'd 8-2 be Arsenal fan right now...Inspired the panic buys of Andre Santos, Park Chu-Young and Yossi Benayoun (also Arteta and Mertesacker).

Sep 2011: Blackburn 4-3 Arsenal - Blackburn, who would be relegated this season, managed by Steve Kean score four times against the Gunners. 46-year-old Yakubu scores twice.

Feb 2012: Milan 4-0 Arsenal - This wasn't a vintage Milan side. Another round of 16 humping. Of course they go 3-0 up at HT of the return leg and don't score anymore.

Feb 2012; Sunderland 2-0 Arsenal Like day follows night, Arsenal crash out of another cup competition in February.

Apr 2012: Arsenal 1-2 Wigan - in a race for 3rd place that they were fortunate to get on the last day of the season at West Brom, Arsenal couldn't copy with a a Franco Di Santo/Jordi Gomez 1-2 in the first eight minutes.

Oct 2012: Norwich 1-0 Arsenal Well organised, tough, and of course, Arsenal can't cope with Grant Holt.

Nov 2012: Man Utd 2-1 Arsenal The first game against RVP since his move to Old Trafford. Scores after 3 minutes, obviously. Andre Santos swaps shirts on the pitch with him at HT. 90th minute consolation by Cazorla makes scoreline reflect better on Arsenal.

Dec 2012 - Bradford p1-1 Arsenal Losing on penalties to a League Two side after naming a strong team? Not great.

Feb 2013: Arsenal 0-1 Blackburn - Trophyless for 8 years, Championship Blackburn win at the Emirates to end Gooners' FA Cup dream.

Feb 2013: Arsenal 1-3 Bayern Munich - Could have been a lot more. But the tie was over by the end of the first leg. Of course, Arsenal win 2-0 in the second to NEARLY go through when the pressure's off. A pattern begins to emerge...

August 2013: Arsenal 1-3 Aston Villa - A mediocre but determined Villa side score 3 on the opening day, including one by left-back Antonio Luna who makes his only notable contribution to the Premier League.And thus, ArsenalFanTV was born.

Dec 2013: Man City 6-3 Arsenal - Defence? What defence?

Feb 2014: Liverpool 5-1 Arsenal - It must be February again. Arsenal do what they usually do after an embarrassment and put a good run of results together, eight wins and one draw out of nine going into this game.

Liverpool 4-0 up after 20 minutes, and to be honest it should have been more. They were superb, Arsenal utterly and predictably abject.

Feb 2014: Arsenal 0-2 Bayern Munich - Szczesny sent off, tie over after the first leg again.

March 2014: Chelsea 6-0 Arsenal Wenger's 1000th game. Chelsea 3-0 up in 17 minutes. Even their joke of a substitute Mohammad Salah scored. Whatever happened to him?

April 2014: Everton 3-0 Arsenal - Arsenal let Everton into the race for fourth place by being utterly abject. A sight their fans are very used to seeing.

Nov 2014: Arsenal 3-3 Anderlecht 3-0 up at home - Premier League stalwarts Anthony Vanden Borre and Aleksander Mitrovic with the goals.

Nov 2014: Swansea 2-1 Arsenal - the game afterwards, they let a lead slip with two goals from Swansea in three minutes.

Dec 2014: Stoke 3-2 Arsenal - 3-0 down at half-time, they claw it back only for Callum Chambers to get sent-off. Yet another defeat at Stoke.

Feb 2015: Arsenal 1-3 Monaco This isn't the Monaco team of 2017. This is a Monaco team with an aging Dimitar Berbatov up front. Despite getting a consolation goal in the 90th minute to make it 1-2, they concede seconds later to put the tie beyond their reach after the first leg, again. Embarrassing.And yet again they win the return leg by one goal fewer than they need to go through.

Aug 2015: Arsenal 0-2 West Ham - '12 points a season' was the line now they'd got Petr Cech. He made a blunder for at least one of the goals and another opening day defeat/crisis was upon us.

Sep 2015: Dinamo Zagreb 2-1 Arsenal - The bottom seeds in their Champions League group ease past their hapless opponents.

Sep 2015: Arsenal 2-3 Olympiakos - Maybe they didn't want to go through to the round of 16 and save embarrassment again?

Oct 2015: Sheffield Wednesday 3-0 Arsenal - A classic Arsenal performance.

Nov 2015: Bayern 5-1 Arsenal - More of these later.

Dec 2015: Southampton 4-0 Arsenal - Following a good win against Man City, victory would have put Arsenal top of the league. Instead...

Jan 2016: Arsenal 0-1 Chelsea - Chelsea, a team in crisis and in the bottom half just weeks earlier, make light work of Arsenal, who have Mertesacker sent off, concede 5 minutes later and never recover.

Feb 2016: Arsenal 0-0 Southampton - Arsenal really should be title favourites, and the same night that Leicester beat Liverpool, they meekly draw at home to Southampton.

Feb/March 2016 - Arsenal 0-2 Barcelona, Man Utd 3-2 Arsenal, Arsenal 1-2 Swansea - That time of year again. Three games in a row, and hopes of two trophies go into dust.

March 2016: Arsenal 1-2 Watford - Another cup run comes crashing to an end.

Dec 2016: Everton 2-1 Arsenal - Going well in the league, slack defending allows Ashley Williams to head in from a corner in the last five minutes.

Jan 2017: Arsenal 1-2 Watford 2-0 down after 13 minutes.

Feb 2017: Chelsea 3-1 Arsenal - Bye bye, title hopes.

Feb 2017: Bayern Munich 5-1 Arsenal - Wait, there's more to come...

March 2017: Arsenal 1-5 Bayern Munich -  I guess these things 10-2 come in threes.

March 2017: WBA 3-1 Arsenal - Tony Pulis managed team outmuscles Wenger team? Hmmm, sounds familiar...

April 2017: Crystal Palace 3-0 Arsenal - I for one am shocked Arsenal couldn't cope with a motivated Sam Allardyce side away from home.

August 2017: Liverpool 4-0 Arsenal - This was deliciously Arsenal. Several meltdowns occurred following this game, three games into the season.

October 2017: Watford 2-1 Arsenal - The 'cojones' game.

January 2018: Nottingham Forest 4-2 Arsenal - Their first defeat in the 3rd round of the FA Cup since Bruce Rioch days. Still, at least Eric Lichaj got his dogs.

January 2018: Bournemouth 2-1 Arsenal - Surrendered a lead to a deeply average Bournemouth team.

January 2018: Swansea 3-1 Arsenal - included a delicious defensive blunder for Jordan Ayew's goal.

Feb 2018: Arsenal 1-2 Ostersunds - A team I hadn't heard of until December win at the Emirates and capitalise on Arsenal's complacency.

Feb 2018: Arsenal 0-3 Manchester City ""A disgrace"" - Gary Neville. And he wasn't even talking about the first goal.

Apr 2018: Arsenal 1-1 Atlético Madrid - playing against 10 men after just 10 minutes, then 1-0 up, of course they concede in the last 10 minutes giving themselves a mountain to climb (spoiler: didn't get much further than base camp)

Apr 2018: Manchester United 2-1 Arsenal - Fellaini last minute winner in Wenger's last game vs Man Utd

May 2018: Leicester 3-1 Arsenal - still 0 points away from home in the calendar year after this abject defeat

Dec 2018: Liverpool 5-1 Arsenal - they actually took an early lead. Job done I suppose

Jan 2019: Arsenal 1-3 Manchester United - Sánchez scores against his former club, of course

Apr 2019: Arsenal 2-3 Crystal Palace - a win here would have been enough for CL

Apr 2019: Wolverhampton 3-1 Arsenal - a win here would have been enough for CL. 1st half the most abject I've ever had the pleasure of seeing

Apr 2019: Leicester City 3-0 Arsenal - a win here would have been enough for CL

May 2019: Arsenal 1-1 Brighton - a win here would have been enough for CL

May 2019: Chelsea 4-1 Arsenal - Europa League final - must have been a mental boycott due to the Mkhytarian/Azerbaijan thing

Sep 2019: Watford 2-2 Arsenal - 2 goal lead squandered against the bottom of the table Hornets

Oct 2019: Arsenal 2-2 Crystal Palace - 2 goal lead squandered again

Dec 2019: Arsenal 1-2 Brighton - Freddie's first home game in charge, but now 9 games without a win after this - the worst run since 1977

Dec 2019: Arsenal 0-3 Manchester City - 0-3 and game over after 40 minutes

Dec 2019: Arsenal 1-2 Chelsea - 1-0 up after 80 minutes, what could go wrong? Ah.

Feb 2020: Arsenal 1-2 Olympiakos - 1-0 up after the away leg, what could go wrong? Ah.

Jun 2020: Manchester City 3-0 Arsenal - David Luiz

Jun 2020: Brighton 2-1 Arsenal - merked by Maupay

Updated:
 
Jul 2020: Tottenham 2-1 Arsenal - one up against faltering rivals - at least local bragging rights will be restored. But then Kolasinac. Then despair.

Jul 2020: Aston Villa 1-0 Arsenal - yes, that Villa side. Yes, that Trézéguet

Sep 2020: Liverpool 3-1 Arsenal - actually a decent result given the respective quality of the teams these days

Oct 2020: Manchester City 1-0 Arsenal - now 29 games without an away league win vs 'big 6'

"The Golden State Warriors have overcome FiveThirtyEight’s 1 in 1,000 odds to become the 2022 NBA Champions","Last October, FiveThirtyEight’s [2021-22 NBA Model](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-nba-predictions/) predicted that the Warriors would be #22 in the league with 35 wins and 47 losses. It gave the team a 22% chance to make the playoffs, a 0.5% chance (1 in 200) to make the NBA Finals, and a 0.1% chance (1 in 1,000) to win the championship.

Adding to the Warriors obstacles this postseason were Steve Kerr’s terrible rotation choices. He frequently placed middling players like Andrew Wiggins (0.8 net RAPTOR) and Kevon Looney (0.7) in the starting lineup, while snubbing superstars Gary Payton II (3.4) and Andre Iguodala (1.6) with few minutes. He even kept scrub Klay Thompson (-1.2) in a starting role for all six finals games, despite the net RAPTOR metric proving that his minutes would have been put to better use in the hands of reliable role players like Damion Lee (-0.7) or Joan Toscano-Anderson (-0.5). According to the model, Kerr's superstitious trust in his own coaching experience over the cold reality of advanced statistics contributed to the Warriors' extremely long odds of winning the title.

But tonight, the Warriors have defied those odds to become the most unlikely NBA champions in league history. According to the model,\* fans can expect to wait another 138 years before they see a Cinderella story of this magnitude again. Congrats to Steph, Klay, and Dray! What a surreal and unbelievable vision it was to see those three hoisting up the Larry O'Brien trophy.

^(\* The sum of the probability of all teams ranked higher than the Warriors to win the championship was 99.5%. The probability of a win for any lesser team is) [^(P = 1 - 0.995\^y)](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=1-.995%5Ey%3D0.5) ^(where y is the number of years in the simulation.

[OC] Are you horribly bored? Are your weekends now hollow without football? Are you fed up with angrily debating what might happen to football leagues across the world? Perhaps this could help a little – I made a list of over 100 football documentaries to help pass the time.,"Looks like we’ve got quite a few weekends coming up without football. We’ve had recent posts about the best old games to watch, but now we’re getting a little bit into mindless shitpost territory. Well, here’s a big list of documentaries to hopefully help us pass the time. Everything in blue is a clickable link, but please let me know if any of the links don’t work. Aside from the last two documentaries in the “From around the Globe” section, every documentary is either linked, available on Netflix, available on Amazon Prime for free, or for no more than $5. Please also comment your favorite documentaries and I will do my best to add them to the list.

# *”Football’s Greatest” Series*   

Before the 2010 World Cup there was a series called *Football's Greatest*. A bunch of 30-minute episodes about the 20 or so greatest players ever. Richard Keys, who isn’t exactly the most popular figure these days, is the narrator, but he sticks to the script and doesn’t detract from the episodes. Here are the ones I can find on Youtube. Since this was made in 2010 both Messi and Ronaldo appear in “The Contenders” episode – basically an episode on all the players who narrowly missed the cut. Also, if you just enter “Football’s greatest” into youtube you’ll see videos for more players than are covered in this list.

One of the most heartwarming documentaries I’ve ever seen. Available in HD on Amazon Prime for $5 too.  

[**The Other Final**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpDIFfdjsRw) - On the same day as the 2002 World Cup final is taking place ""The Other Final"" is also played.

# *ESPN 30 for 30 Documentaries*  

ESPN’s “30 for 30” series have largely been outstanding documentaries. 

[**The Two Escobars**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFQuBe7fagY) - In my opinion the best 30 for 30 ESPN have ever done and perhaps the best football documentary period. Award winning and critically praised it chronicles the intertwining stories of Andres and Pablo Escobar; One a humble footballer, one a notorious Colombian drug lord. Pablo Escobar's grip over Colombian culture during the 1980s extended all the way into football, and this film reveals the often tricky situation Colombia found themselves in during this time. Andres Escobar infamously scored an own goal to knock Colombia out of the 1994 World Cup, and was murdered a few weeks later in Colombia at a bar in cartel related activity. I have linked to a youtube link that allows you to buy the documentary. It is also available for $1.99 on Amazon Prime. Search “ESPN 30 for 30” and select Season 1, Episode 27. It won numerous awards and is a truly extraordinary film.

[**Ceasfire Massacre**](https://vimeo.com/165328291) - Set to the backdrop of *The Troubles* in Northern and the Republic of Ireland. There was a horrifying massacre at a pub in Ireland where fans were watching the Republic in the 94 World Cup. Another great watch. 

[**The Myth of Garrincha**](https://vimeo.com/143806499) - Very moving story of Brazilian hero Garrincha, football's most flawed genius, and arguably football's most intriguing figure. u/MarcoshLA is also the director!    

[**Mysteries of the Jules Rimet trophy**](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x20ypdc) - The story of football's holy grail, the Jules Rimet trophy, is an incredible one. FIFA, the Nazis, a dog, Bobby Moore, and thieves in Rio all play roles in this story.  

[**Barbosa: The man who made Brazil cry**](https://vimeo.com/100746877) - The sad story of Brazilian 1950 goalkeeper Barbosa, who was blamed for Brazil's shock loss to Uruguay in Rio de Janerio that year.

# *English/Scottish Football*  

[**Orient for a Fiver**]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvdCNgHKCwY) – *“You, you little cunt, when I tell you to do something, and you, you fucking big cunt, when I tell you to do something, do it. And if you come back at me, we'll have a fucking right sort-out in here. All right? And you can pair up if you like, and you can fucking pick someone else to help you, and you can bring your fucking dinner. 'Cos by the time I've finished with you, you'll fucking need it.""*  - The now classic fly-on-the-wall documentary following Leyton Orient during their disastrous 1994-95 campaign in England’s Second Division. The Club, dealing with severe financial difficulties hired John Sitton as manager the previous season, and this charts Sitton’s descent into Orient hell as his now legendary half-time rants get increasingly more bizarre, funny, and bleak. 

[**Liverpool vs Manchester United: Us and Them**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zbj9U8HLAe4) – Fans on both sides of the divide of English football’s biggest rivalry take you through just what this match means.

[**An Impossible Job**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAke3P4hKZA) – A remarkable fly-on-the-wall documentary following England’s ill-fated qualification for the 1994 World Cup under Graham Taylor. Equal parts darkly funny as it is tragic, this documentary has an enduring legacy in English football, and some would argue has unfairly tarnished the reputation of a great man. 

[**Busby, Stein, and Shankly**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blMK29PudKk) – A provocative look at the lives of three legendary scots, whose managerial achievements changed English football forever.  

[**The Crazy Gang**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&v=kdU1qUN7LX8&feature=emb_title) – The infamous 1987-88 Wimbledon team, known as much for their brutal challenges as for their football.

"[OC] if Damian Lillard leaves the team to chase rings, he may be giving up on another pursuit — being the greatest player in team history. What other players are in the running for theirs?","When we talk about accolades for NBA players, there are always a few key items on the checklist: All-Star trips, All-NBA berths, MVPs, etc. But one rules them all: *rings.* 

The mad quest for [gold](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Smaug) has led players on journeys all across the map. Are they trying to win out of a competitive spirit? To shut up critics and trolls? To earn glory that will last a lifetime? Obviously that has worked from time to time, but other times the effort feels a little empty -- even in success. Perhaps your team was TOO good (like Kevin Durant), or you weren't the MAIN star on the team, or your opponent got injured. 

It's also fair to say that winning a ring isn't all that unusual. If my math checks out, a team wins a title every year. That makes 75 years of NBA champions -- 65 years of MVP (which started in 1956) -- 53 years of Finals MVP (which started in 1969). It's an exclusive club -- especially when you consider repeats -- but it's a growing one.

In contrast, there's a prestigious club that will grow more slowly. A basketball honor that we don't discuss very often. That is: being the **greatest player in your franchise's history.** 

Perhaps the fact that we don't discuss that topic very often devalues the concept and contributes to a culture of team swapping and ring chasing. If we valued the Team GOAT as a badge of honor, perhaps players would stick around more often and build their legacy at home. 

Of course, there's no easy way to define a Team GOAT. There's subjectivity involved in terms of what criteria you use and what accolades you value the most. Then again, when has subjectivity ever stopped us from debating player rankings before?

Interested in that topic, I wanted to go through the league and review each team's GOAT, and debate whether a current player has a chance of grabbing that mantle. An important note of distinction here: we're not talking about the best player to ever weigh a team's uniform -- we're rankings these players contributions on THAT team and that team only, as if their other years didn't exist.

Rather than give specific percentage odds for each, we'll group them into a few tiers. Locks or **Near Locks** (defined as over an 80% chance), **Likely** (somewhere in between 50-80% chance), **Possible** (somewhere in between 25-50%), **Unlikely** (5-25%), and **Almost No Chance** (less than 5%).

---

######**TEAM GOAT DISCUSSIONS**

**ATLANTA.** For this exercise, we're going to lean heavily on total ""win shares"" with the team, which is conveniently listed on basketball-reference's team pages. Using that as our default ranking, two candidates emerge: Bob Pettit (136 win shares, mostly when the team was in St. Louis) and Dominque Wilkins (107 WS). Pettit may be harder to beat than young fans realize; he was an All-Star in each of his 11 seasons, and he won MVP twice. In fact, he cracked the top 5 in MVP voting on 8 separate occasions. Even more notably, he led the team to their only NBA championship. That's an incredible resume that's going to be tough for Trae Young to beat. Young can best Pettit in longevity and total points, but he's probably going to need to win multiple titles to get this more nuanced honor. We'll call this one **unlikely.** If the Hawks can reconfigure their roster and get back to contender status, then perhaps this ups back into ""possible.""

---

**BOSTON**. Like Trae Young, Jayson Tatum benefits from a ""one-and-done"" era where he can jump to the NBA and start putting up numbers immediately. He's in his 5th season right now and he's still only 23 years old. Averaging about 6.5-7 wins shares per year, he can potentially crack 100. That said, this isn't a franchise that's graded by win shares. They win *titles.* Whether you want to call their GOAT Bill Russell (164 WS, 11 titles, 5 MVPs) or Larry Bird (146 WS, 3 titles, 3 MVPs), there's **almost no chance** that Tatum rises to the top of this ladder.

---

**BROOKLYN**. Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving surprised a lot of people when they chose to go to the Nets, a team without much of a storied history. Perhaps they were anticipating this post. After all, there's a wide open lane here. ""Dr. J"" Julius Erving led the Nets to two ABA titles, and Jason Kidd led the team to two NBA Finals, but neither stayed with the franchise long. Erving lasted 3 seasons, Kidd only 6.5. As a result, the team's leader in win shares is Buck Williams with 63. Going forward, the question will be: how long can Kevin Durant (age 33) last? How many titles can he rack up in the meantime? The longevity won't be on his side, but winning a couple of titles may be a realistic goal presuming this team can be healthy at the right time. Despite all the injury issues, they're still the Vegas favorite this season. Given that, Durant or James Harden may be **possible** Team GOATS. Then again, it's ""possible"" the team isn't healthy down the stretch and blows it up entirely this summer.

---

**CHARLOTTE**. Even if we include the old Charlotte Hornets' history here, this is another franchise with a relatively open lane to GOAT. In over 30+ years, they've never even reached the Conference Finals. Kemba Walker leads the way with 48.5 win shares, which is an attainable goal for young LaMelo Ball. Ball snagged 2.8 as a rookie, and is on pace to double that this season. If he can play 10 years with the franchise, he'll likely become their GOAT. Will he actually stay in Charlotte that long? It's TBD, so let's call this one **possible** as well.

---

**CHICAGO**. Super scorer Zach LaVine has proven a lot of skeptics wrong, but he'd need to clone himself a few times to come close to Michael Jordan (205 WS, 6 titles, 5 MVPS). Our scale only goes as low as almost **no chance**, and this certainly qualifies.

---

**CLEVELAND.** The Cavs are in a similar boat here. Young studs Darius Garland and Evan Mobley both have awesome futures, but there’s a difference between awesome and immortal. **Almost no chance** they can surpass the iconic achievements of LeBron James here.

---

**DALLAS**. LaMelo Ball is chasing Kemba Walker in Charlotte, but Luka Doncic has a much higher bar here in Dirk Nowitzki. Thanks in part to his incredible longevity and loyalty, Nowitzki racked up 206 win shares with the team in addition to an MVP and NBA title. The win shares will be tough. Luka's career high is 8.8, so even if he gets to 10 a year, he'll need to rattle off 15+ years of peak performance. Going for multiple MVPs or multiple championships may be the easier path here. Can Luka win more than 1 of each? I wouldn't say that it's likely, but it's definitely **possible.** Dallas doesn't look like a title contender yet, but there's plenty of time for the kid (still age 22.)

---

**DENVER**. The international takeover continues. At the moment, the franchise leaders in win shares are Dan Issel (95) and Alex English (84). However, there's a Serbian freight train behind them that's about to run them off the road. Jokic has racked up an incredible 71 win shares in his career despite being only 26. He had 15.5 last season alone. Even if you think advanced stats are too kind to the Joker, he can make up for it with his MVP trophy, which neither Issel nor English have. As long as Jokic plays a few more seasons, he's a **near lock** to grab the GOAT status here.

---

**DETROIT.** After a slow start, # 1 pick Cade Cunningham is heating up and looking the part of a future All-Star. He also takes pride in his leadership abilities and may be the type of player to stick around for 10+ years. In terms of *win shares*, that may put him in play over franchise leader Bill Laimbeer (98 WS). In terms of *legacy*, he still will be **unlikely** to pass Isiah Thomas, who racked up 2 titles and 11 All-Star appearances. That's nothing against Cunningham -- it's just friggin' hard to win multiple championships.

---

**GOLDEN STATE.** It's hard to win multiple championships -- it's hard to be a Team GOAT. But at the moment, we have one player who has already done it. Steph Curry has recently passed over Wilt Chamberlain in total win shares for the team -- 117 to 114 (Chamberlain didn't play his entire career with them). Add in the fact that Curry won 2 MVPs and 3 titles and his overall impact on the game, and he could retire tomorrow as the greatest Warrior of all time. He's our first official **lock.**

---

**HOUSTON**. Perhaps Damian Lillard should take note, because James Harden essentially waved the white flag on his quest for Team GOAT with his trade demand last year. If he had stuck around, perhaps Harden (115 WS) could have challenged Hakeem Olajuwon (160) for the top spot. That said, matching Olajuwon and winning two titles would have been much more difficult. Looking forward, is there any chance Jalen Green or Alperen Sengun could threaten Olajuwon? *Theoretically*, sure, but realistically let's call this **almost no chance.**

---

**INDIANA**. Although he never got over the hump, Reggie Miller (174 WS) has a comfortable stranglehold on his team's GOAT. It's looking less and less likely -- **almost no chance** -- that a current team star like Domatas Sabonis could challenge him. Sabonis has made 2 All-Stars in his 5 years with the team, but his 30 win shares are a loooong way away from Miller. And according to some rumors, Sabonis may not be here much longer.

---

**L.A. CLIPPERS**. We have an opening, table 12. The Clippers have existed for over 50 seasons in some form or another, but they never won a title. Their best player ever is probably Chris Paul (team high 78 WS), but he only played 6 seasons with the franchise. Current stars Kawhi Leonard and Paul George may have trouble matching that, but they have a decent shot to win a title if they both come back healthy next year. To Clippers fans, I'd presume that's more meaningful than CP3's good-but-not-great ""Lob City"" era. Let's call it **possible.**

---

**L.A. LAKERS**. LeBron James already won a title in L.A. and could potentially win more, but he has **almost no chance** to beat local legends like Kobe Bryant (team high 173 WS, 5 titles, 1 MVP) or Magic Johnson (156 WS, 5 titles, 3 MVPs.) Remember, we're only talking about their contributions on this particular team.

---

**MEMPHIS**. The Grizzlies don't have the type of history as the Lakers do, which puts this franchise in play. The best right now would probably be Marc Gasol (77 WS). But while Gasol had one DPOY, the rest of his resume is a little light for a Team GOAT -- he only made 3 All-Star teams and never finished higher than 8th in MVP voting. Given that, Ja Morant's ascension is certainly **possible.** Heck, he's on target to finish in the top 8 in MVP this season. If he stays healthy and sticks around Memphis for his whole career, he'll likely best Gasol in WS. Of course, the real key may be whether his squad can make a Finals appearance (the Grit n' Grind teams peaked in the Conference Finals.) 

---

**MIAMI**. Prime LeBron James was the best player in franchise history, but in terms of career accomplishments it'd have to be Dwyane Wade (116 WS, 3 titles.) Jimmy Butler arrived too late to challenge that, and Bam Adebayo doesn't have the type of game that's going to put him in MVP races. I'd suggest there's **almost no chance** either can challenge Wade here.

---

**MILWAUKEE**. So far, we've given one Team GOAT to Steph Curry, and presumed Nikola Jokic is on the verge of cracking that in Denver. The same applies here to Giannis Antetokounmpo, whom I'll call another **near lock.** I don't think he officially has it yet though. Although Kareem Abdul-Jabbar only played 6 years for the franchise, he holds a lead over Giannis in win shares 115 to 81. Giannis should be able to pass him in a couple of years though and end all debates about Team GOAT status (again, career value, not prime value.)

---

**MINNESOTA**. The Timberwolves have never won a title or even made the Finals in their 33-year history, but Kevin Garnett still feels like he's locked into the top spot as a beloved Team GOAT. He racked up 140 win shares, 10 All-Star trips, and 1 MVP by the time he left for Boston. In theory, Karl-Anthony Towns may be able to challenge the win shares if he sticks around (he's about halfway there at 61 right now), but I don't know if he has enough of a two-way game to supplant Garnett in the minds of fans. A title would do it, but that's more **unlikely** than realistic. 

---

**NEW ORLEANS**. If we count all versions dating back to 2002, then Chris Paul is going to grab his second Team GOAT here (as he leads the team with 76 win shares and came closest to winning MVP.) It's a beatable total, but can it be beaten by Zion Williamson or Brandon Ingram? If fully healthy, Williamson would have a great chance. He recorded 8.7 win shares in just 61 games last season. But can we expect Williamson to play 6-7 years at an elite level? And stay with this franchise for that whole time? That combo may be **unlikely** right now. Meanwhile, Ingram only has about 13 win shares in his 3 seasons, so I'm not sure he has enough upside to crack the top spot either.

---

**N.Y. KNICKS**. Right now, I'd give the nod to Patrick Ewing (team high 123 WS) despite the fact that he never won the title. Of the current crop, you'd presume a young player like R.J. Barrett may have the best chance if he improves and plays 10+ years with the team. Still, does he have it in him to beat Ewing and his 11 All-Star trips? It's between an ""unlikely"" and an **almost no chance** to me, so I'll lean to the latter.

---

**OKLAHOMA CITY**. If you include the Sonics history, then Gary Payton (124 WS) holds the lead over Kevin Durant (108 WS) and Russell Westbrook (97 WS). It's possible that young Shai Gilgeous-Alexander beats them in terms of longevity with the team, but there's **almost no chance** he can match their peak production and start winning MVPS. Keep grabbing those lottery balls, Sam Presti, because you may need another all-timer to get back to the Finals.

**ORLANDO**. Shaquille O'Neal only played 4 seasons with Orlando, so he trails Dwight Howard by a large margin in terms of win shares (88 to 48, respectively.) Younger fans may forget just how good Dwight Howard was in his day -- he cracked the top 5 in MVP voting in four separate seasons. I don't see any of the young Magic threatening that, so we'll give this one an **almost no chance** as well. 

---

**PHILADELPHIA**. Julius Erving is probably the most iconic 76er of all time, but if we base it on resume alone it may be hard to argue against Dolph Schayes. Back when the team was the Syracuse Nationals, Schayes led them to an NBA title and made 11 All-Star teams in the process. He also leads Erving in total win shares, 142 to 106. Current star Joel Embiid has a long way to go to reach that company. Given his durability problems, he's only reached 36 win shares -- a total that doesn't even crack the team's top 12 yet. He can probably make an argument if he wins multiple MVPs or multiple titles, but that's an **unlikely** combination. Of course, if Daryl Morey can pull in a haul for Ben Simmons at the deadline then we may have to rethink that. 

---

**PHOENIX**. Technically the team's leader in win shares is Shawn Marion with 93, but I'd say that either Steve Nash (83 WS) or Charles Barkley (44 WS) would be Team GOAT based on peak performance. I don't think there's much chance that Devin Booker is going to challenge for MVPs in the same way -- he's already in his 7th season and he's never cracked an All-NBA team yet. His advanced stats have never been great either, so he's only gotten up to 25.3 win shares so far. Still, it's **possible** that he can work his way into Team GOAT discussions in another way. The Suns haven't won a title in their 54-year history. If Booker can help make that happen -- and have a long, Reggie Miller-ish career -- then I think he'd be considered the franchise's GOAT.

---

**PORTLAND**. The inspiration for this post, Damian Lillard may have to sacrifice his chances to be Team GOAT if he never plays for the Trail Blazers again. In terms of *peak* performance, the best Blazer of all time is Bill Walton (who won the title and then MVP), but Walton only played 4 years for the franchise. In terms of career performance, Lillard is chasing Clyde Drexler. Drexler racked up 109 win shares (to Lillard's 95), 8 All-Star appearances (to Lillard's 6), and 2 Finals appearance (to Lillard's 0.) Where Lillard can make up for that deficit is longevity. Drexler left the team at age 32, while Lillard is still there (for now) at age 31. If he stays loyal and sticks around for 3-4 more years, he's **likely** to be considered their best ever.

---

**SACRAMENTO**. The ""Sacramento Kings"" don't have an illustrious history, but this franchise has been around the mill (first as the Rochester Royals, then Cincinnati Royals, then Kansas City Kings, then Sacramento Kings.) If we include all that history, there's **almost no chance** that De'Aaron Fox can surpass the individual greatness of Oscar Robertson (154 win shares.)

---

**SAN ANTONIO**. Ditto here. There are 5 San Antonio Spurs with 100+ win shares, led by Tim Duncan (206 WS) and David Robinson (179 WS.) When you factor in the titles to boot, then there's **almost no chance** that any of these young Spurs can reach those heights.

---

**TORONTO**. Kawhi Leonard was the face of the championship, but I suspect most Toronto fans would consider Kyle Lowry (75 win shares) their greatest player in whole. Lowry ""only"" played 9 years for the team, so it's possible that a young stud like Scottie Barnes can surpass that and surpass the win share total. Can he match Lowry's 6 All-Star trips and NBA title? That's somewhere between possible and **unlikely.** Barnes' all-around game doesn't lend itself to gaudy numbers and All-Star votes, but it's too hard to count out a rookie who's been this good.

---

**UTAH**. The Utah Jazz are good enough to contend for a title either this year or next. But even with that, I don't think anyone would consider Donovan Mitchell or Rudy Gobert on par with the freakish durability and longevity of Karl Malone (230 win shares) or John Stockton (208 WS). It'd probably take 2-3 titles for Gobert (third in franchise history with 82 WS) to take the mantle, and that falls into the **almost no chance** category.

---

**WASHINGTON**. Current star Bradley Beal has officially surpassed his old buddy John Wall on the win shares list (49 to 44), but he's still got some ways to go before he matches all-time leader Wes Unseld (110 WS.) Unseld also won an MVP and NBA trophy. The Beal Fan Club is formally petitioning for us to switch to ""total points"" though, because he's likely to catch franchise leader Elvin Hayes if he sticks around for next year (Hayes has 15,551, Beal 14,119.) Overall, it's hard to see the seeds of a title contending team here so we'll call this **unlikely.**

"Jolyon Palmer's opinion on the way Max Verstappen ""carries himself"" on-track, and how he races with Lewis from the BBC Chequered Flag podcast","""From what I saw, Max is just happy to crash with Lewis and that is what every single flash-point was \[this year\], bar the brake testing which is something different entirely. But every incident where they are racing wheel-to-wheel, it is Max saying 'hey, if we crash, we crash' and Lewis saying 'I really do not want to crash, because it is going to be really bad for the championship'. And this goes back to day two in Imola and day four in Barcelona.""

""It has been the case a lot this year, but now we are getting to the end of the season and Max has had the slower car for the last few, maybe it was the quicker car this weekend in the race it was hard to tell because of the tire differences, but he certainly had a better car in qualifying - anyway.""

""Every one of these incidents, he is putting his car in a position that is saying 'either I am going to exit this corner ahead, or neither of us are going to exit the corner', which is an impossible way to go racing with someone. And of course if they crash, then Max has one hand on the trophy, he has 8 points \[on Lewis\] and does not even need to beat Lewis in Abu Dhabi - and if neither of them score points in Abu Dhabi, then Max is the champion so he will race like this again.""

""And it is a really tricky thing trying to figure out how to work with this from here as a sport to try and just have a fair fight. Because it does not feel it is quite that at the moment, and where we are at now, for the second race of three where, basically, rather than being overtaken on track the stewards are having to just give a five-second penalty, in Brazil they did not but they should have. Max is not going to be overtaken on the track, he is going to cover the inside, not let anyone round the outside and if he goes off-track then 'to hell with it' but 'give me a penalty if you want, but I am not backing down'.""

and the results are in for... the LEAST Valuable Player,"While the media may focus on the MVP award and other prestigious honors, reddit has the distinct honor of awarding the LVP. **[The LEAST Valuable Player](https://images.app.goo.gl/jwXWsKEJUk6LQhNc6
)**. It's a tradition that dates back to 2016-17, when aging Indiana SG Monta Ellis won the inaugural trophy and then promptly disappeared from the NBA forever. In 2017-18, Minnesota SG [Jamal Crawford](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8ai7pl/the_results_are_in_for_least_valuable_player/?st=jsdf3cqi&sh=70ff7ca4) won the (dis)honor with some incredibly bad defensive numbers. In 2018-19, New Orleans SF [Solomon Hill](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/b8xut2/the_results_are_in_for_least_valuable_player/) won LVP by helping to sink a drowning team and accelerating Anthony Davis' decision to fly the coop. Last season, lil' [Isaiah Thomas](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hukwu8/the_results_are_in_for_least_valuable_player/
) won for a short starting stint with the Wizards. 

Remember, here are the criteria and caveats:

--- Obviously, the worst players in the league are the ones who sit at the end of the bench and don't get any playing time. However, this award focuses on players who log a decent amount of minutes and consequently affected their team's play the most. Simply put: the more you play, the more damage you can do. 

--- And that actual ""damage"" is important. If you're on a tanking team, no one cares about your poor play; it may even be a positive. I'm also ignoring young players (under 21) who are still developing and can't be expected to be solid players yet. 

--- Similarly, we don't want to judge players within the context of their salary any more than the actual MVP does. We also do not weigh in injuries either. We want to focus on players' on-court performance instead.

Without further ado, let's get started!

---

######**(dis)honorable mentions**

**SF Kelly Oubre, Golden State: 30.7 minutes per game, -0.7 RPM**

Some stars come out firing and trying to set an MVP narrative early in the season, and unfortunately some starters come out firing and clanking and earning some early *LVP* buzz as well. That certainly described Kelly Oubre Jr.'s initial stint with his new team. He shot 7-40 (17.5%) from the field and 0-17 (yes, 0%) during his first three games, and didn't really find much of a rhythm until February. It was a cold stretch that reminded us a lot of Mike Conley's debut in Utah last year. But still, as much as Oubre got meme'd and made fun of early on, he's not true ""LVP"" material. He's an active defender and a live body for a team that's light on wing depth. 

**PF Kevin Love, Cleveland: 24.9 minutes per game, +0.0 RPM**

If we're talking about shitty seasons, you can make a case that Kevin Love is the smelliest turd in the bowl. The Cavs are paying him $31M this season, and in return he's given them 25 games and one memorable [lowlight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXaJ3bIm-gE). If a college football player needs a ""Heisman moment"" to win the trophy, that inboards pass could have been Love's ""LVP moment."" But all that said, there's some debate about whether Love's season truly hits the criteria that we've laid out in the past. According to the bylaws, we're not supposed to hold injuries or contracts against him. His play on the court has been below-standard, but not *terrible* by the standards of a true LVP candidate. For that reason, we're giving him a (outlet) pass on this trophy.

**C Andre Drummond, CLE/LAL: 27.0 minutes per game, -1.4 RPM**

Congratulations to the Cleveland Cavaliers for earning TWO separate candidates for this award. The team paid nearly $60M combined for two big names in Kevin Love and Andre Drummond, and still ranked in the bottom 3 in terms of offensive rating and overall SRS power rank. Ultimately, it got so ugly that the Cavs had to buy out Drummond's salary (a decision they may have done with Love as well, if not for his longer-term contract.)

Drummond ended up signing with the defending champion L.A. Lakers in a move that outraged a few pundits. The rich get richer! This isn't fair! Of course, all that quieted down when they actually saw Andre Drummond play. While he's still only 27 years old, Drummond looks older and more sluggish than that. There's a decent chance he's still meal planning with his old teammate Greg Monroe. Drummond can still rebound well, but he gets lost otherwise and his impact on his new team has been mixed. I don't know if I'd call him one of the *worst* rotational players in the NBA, but he's up there for most disappointing.

---

######**OUR OFFICIAL LVP BALLOT**

**(5) PG Brad Wanamaker, GS/CHA: 17.3 minutes per game, -3.1 RPM**

We're living in a day and age where it's become common for NBA teams to buy out their overpriced stars like Andre Drummond. The implication is: we'd rather you sit at home than come to work. It's the sports equivalent of getting fired with pay.

It's rarer when a player is so bad that the team has to pay EXTRA to get rid of them, which is what happened when the Golden State Warriors called a mulligan on backup PG Brad Wanamaker. Wanamaker was an ice cold 61-173 from the field to start the year (35.3%) before the Warriors pulled the plug. They had to attach a R2 pick in order to get a team (CHA) to take him off their hands and save them some luxury tax money. (Meanwhile, Milwaukee did a similar move in calling a mulligan on their free agent signing D.J. Augustin.)

Both Wanamaker and Augustin were busts for their teams, but because they played limited minutes (under 20 per game for half the year), they avoid the LVP podium. The same logic spares some other rotational players like Mike Scott (PHI). In an ideal world, the LVP would be a starter. And speaking of starters, let's meet our next finalist...

---

**(4) PG Elfrid Payton, N.Y. Knicks: 23.6 minutes per game, -1.6 RPM**

The New York Knicks have been a feel good story all season long, but PG Elfrid Payton hasn't endeared himself to many of the diehard fans. He's started 63/63 games but had trouble contributing offensively. Last year, he operated as a traditional point guard for the team (illustrated by his 7.2 assists). This year, Tom Thibodeau has handed those playmaking duties to breakout star Julius Randle instead. It's been a boon for Randle, but it's left Payton without much to do. His 3.4 assists per game are a very low number for a starting guard who's playing 24 minutes a night. His 29% shooting from 3 (on 1.6 attempts per game) makes him miscast as a complementary spacer as well. It's fair to suggest he's been the worst starting PG in the NBA this season.

That said, Elfrid Payton will be spared from the scarlet letters (L-V-P) for two reasons. He's been all right defensively, although opinions on that front vary based on metrics (+2.3 on ESPN RPM, -0.6 on BPM). Still, solid defense on the perimeter is a reason why the Knicks hold opponents down, and a reason why the team's been overachieving this year. It may be hard to win MVP on a 4 seed, but it's even harder to win *LVP* on a 4 seed. Whatever he's doing, it can't be *that* bad.

---

**(3) SG Dwayne Bacon, Orlando: 25.7 minutes, -1.6 RPM**

Former Florida State wing Dwayne Bacon showed some promise as a young player in Charlotte, but took a sizable step backwards in 2019-20. Despite that, his former coach Steve Clifford brought him in to Orlando and gave him a large role. Bacon started 50 games, and actually scored the second most points on the team (total.) Unfortunately, he didn't do that with much efficiency or skill. He shot under 30% from three and had bad defensive metrics to boot.

Based on (lack of ) production, Bacon has a legitimate LVP case. The question is: does he get a pass because he's on a tanking team? That's debatable. In the long run, it's a good thing that Orlando may qualify for a top 5 pick. But that said, it doesn't seem like that was their original intention. The team started with Nikola Vucevic, a healthy Markelle Fultz, and a playoff streak of 2 in a row with Clifford at the helm. Crash landing this year may cost Clifford his job, and his loyalty to Bacon may be partially responsible.

---

**(2) SF Rodney Hood, POR/TOR: 17.1 minutes per game, -4.6 RPM**

Portland GM Neil Olshey may have penguin in his DNA, because he can never get his wings to work. Throughout his tenure with the team, the Blazers have routinely struck out with forwards, from big money contracts to Allen Crabbe and Evan Turner to lower-cost whiffs like Mario Hezonja. Knowing that wing depth (and cap space) was always an issue, the team gave a $10M contract to Rodney Hood.

Whoops. To say that Hood has been bad this year is an understatement. He hasn't shot well (36.2% from the field, 30.1% from three, and an impressively bad 40.8% from 2-point range.) And when Hood isn't scoring, he can look frustrated and lost on the court. He blended in to the tune of 9-4-2 per 36 minutes. The advanced stats are even uglier than that. ESPN's RPM metric suggests he has a -4.55 impact per 100 possessions, which ranks # 533 of 534 eligible players. Box plus/minus is even harsher, suggesting he's been a -7.1.

So why doesn't Hood win this LVP award? He's been arguably the worst player on our list. Well, we're going to spare him due to our injury stipulation. Hood came into this season less than a year removed from an Achilles tear. The Blazers obviously thought he'd be ready to contribute (hence the $10M), but in hindsight, he probably should have sat out for another half year before returning to NBA action.

---

**(1) C Aron Baynes, Toronto: 18.5 minutes per game, -2.1 RPM**

This past offseason, the Toronto Raptors had a difficult choice to make at center. Did they want to re-sign A) Serge Ibaka? Or B) Marc Gasol? As it turns out, Masai Uriji went with C) none of the above. The thought process made some sense. After all, the team needed to pony up for Fred VanVleet, and they wanted to keep their financial flexibility open in the future. These days, it's become trendy for teams to try and get away with stopgap options at center so they can spend more money on the perimeter.

One of those cheap plug-ins -- promoted backup Chris Boucher -- has worked out well. Meanwhile, veteran FA Aron Baynes has... not. Baynes has recently been a solid stretch big, but he's getting up there in age (now at 34.) That decline's been accelerating lately. As he traveled north, he hit the wall harder than a White Walker. His three-point shooting (34% and 35% the previous two years) plummeted down to 26.2%. His true shooting of 50% is bad for anyone, but particularly bad for a center. Defensively, his aging body makes him a liability (-1.5 RPM) and not much of a rim protector (0.8 blocks per 36 minutes.)

What's more damning about Baynes' season is the fact that the Raptors *needed* him. As mentioned, they let their vets go and didn't have much in the cupboard down low. As a result, they needed to trot out Baynes more than they'd like. He started his first 24 games, and stated 31 overall. He's a big reason why the team will miss the playoffs this year, which is a big reason why he wins out as our official **LVP.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/nhp7j2/and_the_results_are_in_for_the_least_valuable/,ZandrickEllison,2021-05-21 15:24:46,8644,nba

Hi, u/BanterBoat here, and after my temporary leave during the knockout stages of the tournament, I'm here to finish off with the 2018 World Cup Final. This competition has been a pleasure for the eyes and the heart, and hopefully this final will be just as exciting. France are the favorites in this match, but we're no strangers to upsets...

Before we go on any further, I just want to thank the mods and my fellow match threaders for the great time I've had. It's been a privilege to experience this World Cup with them and all of you r/soccer users, old or new.

And lastly, let's have a quick moment of silence for all the faded flairs. Though no one wants to be faded, one of these teams will join us. Only one can win the World Cup.

Aston Villa displayed their Champions League trophy in the Villa Park tunnel ahead of their match against Arsenal,,https://i.redd.it/9je1ijddwnkd1.jpeg,FairytaleOfBliss,2024-08-25 00:20:56,7257,soccer
"If you are not watching the Premier League, here is why you are missing out on the greatest underdog fairytale in the history of any professional sport.","Leicester City (pronounced Les-ter), or the Foxes, are a relatively insignificant team. They are often fighting for a mid-table place in the Premier League, just as often slugging it out in lower leagues.

The way the league works is simple: 20 teams play against each other, at home and away, adding up to 38 matches in total. You get 3 points for a win, 1 for a draw, 0 for a loss, and the team with the most points at the end of the season wins. Unlike in American sports, there are no playoffs in the Premier League. This means that a team can't make it to the playoffs, then catch fire and take the trophy home. No one wins the Premier League by luck or by going on a hot streak at just the right time. They win by being consistently the best over the course of a year. It's not at all unusual for an underdog team to get off to a great start, before eventually dropping down the table as their good form inevitably wears off. It's a long and psychologically grueling season, and it's difficult to keep up the same level over a year, especially once star players get injuries. Over the course of an entire season, the top teams rise to where they belong. A team can easily finish last despite beating the eventual champions. Imagine if the Miracle on Ice players had to play in a league over an entire year - would they finish above the Soviet Union? A title-winning team needs not just to have star players, but also a sufficiently deep squad so that other top quality players can step in when the stars are injured. This is why ""little"" teams simply do not win the league.

In addition, the Premier League is ruthlessly capitalist. Teams that finish poorly don't get first pick of promising young players, but are instead severely punished with relegation (more on that in the next paragraph). There are no salary caps. The teams with the most money buy up the best players, and those that win trophies and enter elite competitions like the Champions League get huge cash prizes, and attract even more top players, perpetuating the cycle of inequality. Top teams also have the best trainers, the best physios, the best facilities, the best talent scouts. There is a huge disparity in resources and quality between the top teams and the bottom ones, and no real mechanisms to even things up. The same teams almost always finish in the top 4. From 1992-2015 only five teams won the Premier League. The last time a team won the league without having won it before was 38 years ago.

Finishing in the bottom 3 positions (out of 20) is not just humiliating; it's utterly disastrous. It means being relegated to a lower division, which means a subsequent loss of TV money, less fans coming to the stadium since they won't get to see any games against ""big"" teams and players, and an inevitable loss of that team's best players, who don't want to settle for playing in the lower divisions, and whose salaries the club probably can't afford with the reduced income. Meanwhile, the top 2 finishing teams from the lower division secure automatic promotion, while those who place 3-6 will go to a playoff to decide who will clinch that third promotion spot. The promotion and relegation system makes the stakes incredibly high, and a team that has been relegated may struggle years to go back to the top flight, if they ever make it back at all.

Ok, back to Leicester. An 18th-place finish in the 2003-04 season saw Leicester relegated to the Championship (the second division of English football). The next few years they would struggle to retain their position in the Championship. After a poor 2007-08 season, they sank even lower to League One (which, confusingly, is the third division of English football).

They would climb their way back out of League One at the first attempt. The following season, Leicester were widely touted as favourites to win promotion back to the Premier League, but the next three seasons would prove disappointing. In 2013 they finally barely snuck into 6th place, high enough to secure a place in the play-offs for a promotion spot, but lost in absolutely incredible fashion to Watford.

It was the semi-final of the play-offs, a two-legged tie. Leicester saw out the first match in a 1-0 win. Next they had to go to Watford to see out the tie. Watford fought back on their turf, and as the match was winding down the score was 2-1, meaning that on aggregate they stood tied at 2-2. Extra time, and perhaps a penalty shootout beckoned. Then, with just a few seconds left on the clock, Leicester were awarded a penalty to book their spot into the final. What happened next... I will not even describe. Do yourself a favour and watch:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWSc3-NACSY

Following this heartbreak, Leicester would come back stronger, finishing in first place in 2013-14, securing automatic promotion after 10 years out of the top flight.

Their first season back started promisingly, with a few initial decent results, most notably a stunning 5-3 win over Manchester United. Then misery followed, and after months of terrible results Leicester sat rock bottom with only 9 matches left to play. It looked certain that the door back into the Championship stood open after just one season with the big boys.

Incredibly, Leicester managed to win 7 of their last 9 matches to secure probably the most miraculous escape in Premier League history, finishing the season safely in 14th place.

Scandal struck the club during the summer. A sex tape of three Foxes players having an orgy in a Bangkok hotel room with some Thai women leaked out. The players shouted racist abuse including ""slit eye."" One of the players happened to be the son of Foxes manager Nigel Pearson. Leicester's Thai owner was not amused, and Pearson and the three players were subsequently let go. The inspirational manager who had dragged Leicester out of the Championship and led them to that miraculous escape would not be there to guide the ship the following season.

No one was particularly impressed with Pearson's replacement, Claudio Ranieri. He had not managed any Premier League team since Chelsea in 2004 – back in 2004 he was shown the door by new billionaire investor Roman Abramovich, who felt Ranieri wasn’t a sufficiently glamorous manager and brought in Jose Mourinho. Ranieri had since had mixed success with various Italian teams, and his most recent job was manager of Greece – a job that ended in disgrace after just a few months, following a humiliating defeat by the Faroe Islands (yes, that place with a population of 50 thousand which is not even a country). In retrospect, there was a precedent for what Ranieri was about to do with Leicester - in two seasons at Monaco he led the club out of the French Ligue 2 (less confusingly, the second division in France) and the next season finished in second place with 80 points, the highest points tally ever achieved by a team in the French league without winning. Still, he had been unbelievably unimpressive at Greece.

Things did not look good for Leicester. Ranieri was the odds-on favourite to be the first to lose his job. Their squad was made up mostly of unknown players and a few scraps from the table of bigger clubs, including Robert Huth and Danny Simpson, discarded from Chelsea and Manchester United, respectively, for not being good enough (Huth, in fairness, had since made a name for himself as a rock-solid defender at Stoke, but he seemed by now to be past his prime). Their most expensive signing of the summer was N’Golo Kante, brought in from French team Caen - not exactly a blockbuster signing. With this context, it's easy to understand why, going into the 2015-16 season, Leicester were favourites for relegation.

Leicester came flying out in their first match with a 4-2 win over Sunderland, and went undefeated their first 6 matches, the only Premier League team to do so. After a 2-5 spanking at home by contenders Arsenal, their hot streak appeared to be over, and the universe seemed to be back in order.

Undeterred, the Foxes would continue flying. They played extremely energetic, rapid, and deadly counter-attacking football. They were well organized at the back, with all the players knowing their jobs, doing them well, winning the ball and getting it quickly into one of their devastating counter-attacks, sprinting across the pitch like a pack of wild, well, foxes. And three previously unknown quantities – N’Golo Kante, Riyad Mahrez, and Jamie Vardy, started pulling off astonishing performances. As they continued winning week after week, the pundits picked up on a fascinating statistic: 28-year-old goalscorer Jamie Vardy was about to become a record-breaker. But first, more about Vardy. If you thought this was an impressive rags-to-riches story up until now, you haven’t heard anything yet.

Jamie Vardy dreamt of being a professional footballer, but at the age of 16 he was released from the youth academy of Sheffield Wednesday, a team now playing in the Championship. He wasn’t cut out for it. Nevertheless Vardy kept playing semi-professionally for minnows Stocksbridge Park Steels, a team in the seventh tier of English football. He would spend 7 years there, working 12-hour shifts at a factory to support himself and playing on the weekends for £30 a match. At one point, after being charged with assault (according to Vardy, he was sticking up for a deaf friend that was being picked on), he had a 6pm curfew enforced and had to wear an ankle bracelet. Sometimes he had to be subbed off an hour into a match so he could jump into his dad's car to avoid breaking his curfew.

After some impressive displays, he was signed by Halifax Town, a team then in the sixth tier. He finished as the league’s top goalscorer and helped his team win promotion before signing for Fleetwood Town, now in the fifth tier. Again he finished top scorer, and again he helped his team win promotion. His impressive performances got him a call from Leicester. Finally, in 2012, at the age of 25, when most players would expect to have a few years of experience behind them, Vardy could call himself a pro.

Vardy’s first season was poor, prompting criticism from sceptical fans: what the hell was Leicester thinking, signing a player from three divisions below? However in the 2013-14 season he started showing what he could do, and his 16 goals helped Leicester to get back into the Premier League. Early on in the next season, he turned in a man-of-the-match performance against Manchester United, scoring one goal and setting up the other four in that 5-3 win. Along with the rest of his team, he would fail to make much of a mark for the rest of the season, but came to life at the crucial moment, playing a key role in Leicester’s miraculous escape.

Like Leicester, Vardy got off to a blistering start to the 2015-16 season, scoring in the first match of the season. Failing to net in the next two games, he then scored again in the fourth match. And in the fifth. And in the sixth. Twice in the seventh. He scored again in the eighth. Twice in the ninth. And in the tenth. By the twelfth match of the season, Jamie Vardy, who five years earlier worked in a factory, was the top goalscorer of the most competitive league in the world, and he had now scored nine games in a row.

The Premier League record for goals scored in most consecutive matches, 10, had been set in 2002 by Manchester United legend Ruud van Nistelrooy, one of the greatest attacking players since the new millennium. Could Vardy match the great van Nistelrooy?

Could he ever: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUKsTmDjEb0

Having equaled the record, there was one more challenge left: could he BEAT it? Well, what better opposition to go for it than against Manchester United themselves?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot80PrLmkv0

By the way, did I mention that Vardy did all of this with a broken wrist?

At the end of 2015, Leicester made history: they were the only team to ever go from being bottom of the league on Christmas Day one season to top of the league on Christmas Day the next season. Meanwhile, Ranieri got his revenge over Abramovich and Mourinho: Leicester City's victory over Chelsea on December 14 was the final straw in an incomprehensibly dreadful season for defending champions Chelsea. Jose Mourinho, the glamorous manager brought in all those years ago to replace the unfashionable Ranieri, was fired from his second stint at the club that catapulted him to true stardom.

Thanks for playing, Leicester, everyone said. But it’s time for the fairytale to end. Surely these plucky underdogs would start to feel the pressure, would fall apart at some point?

Last weekend was the true test. Leicester faced title favourites Manchester City. Manchester City, until very recently, were a club mired in mediocrity, having undergone a long decline after some golden years in the late 60s. In 2008, the club was purchased by the Abu Dhabi United Group, a private equity company owned by Sheik Mansour bin Zayed al Nahyan, a member of the Abu Dhabi royal family. Overnight, this once middling team was one of the richest in the world. A slew of huge money signings brought a wealth of talented players, finally translating into first place success in the league in 2012 and 2014. Manchester City are for many a symbol of everything that is wrong with the hyper-capitalist world of football: all you need is a billionaire investor with a blank check, and the success will come.

Just to put the gap in resources into context between these two teams: Leicester’s starting line-up cost a grand total of £22.5 million to put together. Last summer, Manchester City brought in Raheem Sterling for a reported £49 million.

That’s right: ONE of Manchester City’s players cost more than TWICE AS MUCH money as Leicester’s ENTIRE first team put together.

Surely, surely, order would be restored?

Well, Leicester hadn’t read the script.
http://www.fullmatchesandshows.com/2016/02/06/manchester-city-vs-leicester-city-highlights-full-match/

It was vintage Leicester: good organisation combined with terrifyingly fast counter-attacks. They went to the richest team in the country, and they didn’t just beat them. They carved them apart, repeatedly, in front of their fans, on their own turf. And they did it in a thrilling, entertaining way that was an advertisement to everyone about why this sport is so great. Player-of-the-season Riyad Mahrez was at his scintillating best, bamboozling the Manchester City defence with a brilliant goal. N'Golo Kante was huge in midfield, charging down the ball and starting counter-attacks. Robert Huth, the Chelsea reject, was a beast at the back and bagged himself two goals.

Leicester now sit five points clear on first place. They are well over the halfway mark. No one is talking any longer about when they will fall away. They are odds-on favourites to take the whole thing. If they do, it will be an unbelievable accomplishment. This weekend, they travel to London to take on contenders Arsenal, one of only two teams who have beaten them (the other being Liverpool) early in the season. Whatever happens, it will be thrilling. 



EDIT: LEICESTER ARE CHAMPIONS. UNBELIEVABLE. Since more people are being linked to this post I've added a couple more explanations on how the league system basically works, for those that know very little, and corrected a couple factual inaccuracies (yes, Manchester City fans, you are absolutely right, Leicester and Man City did not have a similar amount of titles before 2008, sorry about that).

Also bet365 has 100/1 odds on Leicester winning the Champions League next season. It's not quite 5000/1 but it might be worth putting a quid on it.

My inbox has not been silent at pretty much any point during the last few months. The replies I've most enjoyed getting have been the ""I don't usually watch this sport but this season I'm watching every game."" Welcome to the greatest sport in the world.

I'm still getting over this. If you had told anyone a year ago that Wes Morgan would be one of the top defenders of the season, or Kasper Schmeichel one of the top goalkeepers, you would have been ridiculed. If you had started raving over Riyad Mahrez (now officially Player of the Season), you would have gotten a one-word response: ""who?""",https://www.reddit.com/r/sports/comments/44w18p/if_you_are_not_watching_the_premier_league_here/,hipcatjazzalot,2016-02-09 15:18:38,7166,sports

#Team Information 

The AFC Champions **Cincinnati Bengals** (10-7), led by coach Zac Taylor, will be playing in their third SB, first since 1988. The Bengals entered this season amongst the unlikeliest to be here, yet here they are. Led by 2020 1OA QB Joe Burrow (of LSU fame), they will look to put some serious money into the hands of the loyal fans who bet on a +10000 odds for their team to win it all this year.

**Fun Fact**: Joe Burrow was born during the 1996-97 NHL season, the first the Coyotes started play (as the Phoenix Coyotes) and the last the Hartford Whalers would play in Connecticut.

The NFC Champions **Los Angeles Rams** (12-5), led by coach Sean McVay, will be playing in their fifth Super Bowl, 2nd since moving back to LA from St. Louis. In the 2021-22 season, longtime QB Jared Goff, 2 1st round picks, and a 3rd round pick were traded to the Detroit Lions for QB Matthew Stafford - known childhood friend of Los Angeles Dodgers star Clayton Kershaw. 

**Fun Fact**: While grass-hockey will not feature a rubber puck, it will feature a Cooper Kupp.

**TRIGGER WARNING:** >!favoritism, golden child syndrome!< 

[Copy of the post](https://imgur.com/a/bwXVEEJ) 

have five siblings- an older brother (30), two older sisters (27&22), a younger sister (20), and a younger brother (18). My second oldest sister, I'll call her Bebe, is a year apart from me and has always been the golden child- not to say that the rest of us were scapegoats. Bebe did everything. She kept straight As through school, was always MVP or champion on her sports and academic teams. Our parents kept a bunch of shelves for her trophies and medals, and it was always filled. They kept having to add more space. Since the rest of my siblings and I also did athletics and such, we also got shelves for our trophies, but they were never as filled and never as successful as Bebe's. She was competitive, and always a winner. The only sport we ever were equals in was soccer because we played on the same team, but she always got MVP. There was a little resentment, yeah, but I knew it had to be benched. Bebe didn't have an ego or anything, she was just good at what she did, and it wasn't her fault that our parents recognized it. We get along really well. 

We both go to school near to our parents' place, but they've been in the process of moving houses and doing remodels so neither of us have been able to visit. I know that Bebe continues to do sports, and actually has most of her college paid for by sports scholarships. Our parents' remodels were finished, and we both came down to celebrate. They gave us the tour, and in the living room, they have a huge shelf of trophies. I figured they had consolidated all the trophies, but later on, I went down while everyone was out on the deck, and read the name plates. They're all Bebe's. I could understand if my parents had maybe gotten rid of my older sister's, most of hers were participation. But my brother was really successful with lacrosse, I did good at soccer and swimming, my younger sister has numerous academic accolades, my younger brother is a really talented weightlifter and wrestler. The fact that they got rid of all of our trophies for Bebe's is insulting. I'm assuming ours are either in storage or the garbage, because they're not up anywhere else in the house. 

Our parents have never treated us any differently. They love and appreciate us equally, but I guess not. I just feel insulted. I was always vocal about how much I loved soccer and how important it was to me, and when I moved onto college, I kept with it. Sure, I was never the best, but I was good, and I got trophies and medals. They just got rid of them all for Bebe. I don't know how to feel. Am I just being petty? What could I even say to my parents? Right now all I want to say is ""screw you guys"" but I feel like that's unreasonable for a 21 year old. Is there anything I can say to them? Seriously, is this just me being petty? 

TL;DR: My parents took down my sibling and I's trophies and only put up my sister's. 

**RELEVANT COMMENTS** 

**OOP** 

>I haven't spoken to my siblings or Bebe. My other siblings live farther away, so they didn't come out, and I've just been trying to compartmentalize it. I did do some hunting around the house to try and find the trophies, but I didn't find anything so my guess is either it's in their storage unit, in an unpacked box, or in a landfill. I'm going to try and talk to them about it later tonight, so we'll see how that goes.

>She's the only one still doing sports. 

>Is she on track to become a professional althete? 

**OOP** 

>>My younger brother and I still keep up with our sports, and a lot of Bebe's trophies were from high school which was what was weird. If it had been a college trophy wall, it'd make sense because I haven't won a ton of stuff with soccer (my brother has been successful with weights and wrestling though). 

>>Bebe is getting her Bachelor's in psychology, and is planning on moving into sports psychology. 

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7uzt5g/update_my_21f_parents_50sfm_took_down_all_the/)  **Feb 3, 2018** 

[Copy of the update](https://imgur.com/a/2jCGsrT) 

So, I spoke to Bebe the night I wrote my post. I pointed out that it was only her trophies on the shelf, and it wasn’t my favorite interaction. I think being away from her for so long definitely changed my perception of her, and I didn’t really notice that she had changed, especially her ego. I showed her each trophy and name plate, and she went, “Well, of course they’re my trophies. When was the last time you got better than bronze?” I asked her if it didn’t upset her that the rest of ours were basically hidden even though we’ve had a lot of dedication to our activities, and she said, “No. Dedication doesn’t make you a winner.” Bebe told me I was wasting her time, told me to “grow up and get over myself.” Then, she went to go hang out with our parents and I think I finally got it. 

She was the golden child, and we were the scapegoats. The entire time I’d been there, they’d just been hanging out with Bebe and I was there too. I felt so upset, and admittedly, I self-imploded. Having my own sister that I looked up to and admired treat me like that was just a slap in the face. Our older siblings were so far in age from us that we really got close and relied on each other. Later, I got my parents separated from Bebe, and asked. They pretty much echoed her, telling me I hadn’t earned my spot on the shelf, and that my trophies had gone in the garbage because they didn’t impress anybody the way that Bebe’s did, and said that I was an adult, and I should basically just suck it up. I’ve never been more hurt by anything. 

I don’t think I fully realized the scope of it when I was younger, but it clicks now. My game was on the same day as Bebe’s, and they went to hers. They brought snacks to Bebe’s competition, but not mine. Everything for Bebe was hosted at our house, but nothing for the rest of us. I pushed so much of it aside and called all of my suspicions jealousy because my relationship with my sister was more important. But it didn’t matter half as much to her. Her ego has gotten stroked for years on years, and they finally let it all come out and rear its ugly head. I was just flat out offended, especially that they through everything out as though we didn’t matter as much as Bebe. They’d thrown everything out. I was just so mad that I ended up leaving, and my parents yelled at me for “causing drama.” 

I told my siblings about what had happened because I thought they had a right to know that their trophies got removed, and I did try to sound unbiased. It didn’t really work, because my whole family is in a dramatic sinkhole. My younger brother called our parents sobbing, my older sister has been playing passive aggressive and just flat out aggressive phone tag with Bebe, and my little sister was so upset she just called me bawling. I’ve been trying to do damage control, but everyone else is just mad for what’s happened. We all got a text from Bebe that basically read like “I’m sorry I’m better than you, but I deserve our parents’ love more than you” which naturally got everybody riled up again and just caused more problems. This has been basically the worst week of my life and I hate it so... Yeah. There’s my update. My family won’t speak to one another and we’re all in a big dramatic mess. 

TL;DR: I figured out that my parents had thrown out all my trophies in favor of my sister’s, and now my family is melting down into a heap of drama and it’s mostly my fault.

"[Goal] Fede Valverde on Champions League: ""It's a unique trophy for any player in the world. I am willing to sacrifice many things...except my son...but maybe even my wife""",,https://twitter.com/goal/status/1529893527060197396,Sumit316,2022-05-27 13:40:27,6332,soccer
"A Bold Move: Daryl Thunderson Jr., 19, drops out of League of Legends to pursue college dreams","Daryl's tightly-knit community of friends and family were stunned this Sunday morning to discover that Daryl, a ""pretty decent"" League player, had applied to UC Santa Cruz. Most surprising of all: he got in.

""He's been gaining, say, five or six league points a day,"" says Mr. Thunderson, father. ""Then this morning, my son comes out of his room after checking his computer, and he's got the biggest grin. He tells me he's going to major in computer science. I could barely keep my egg scramble down.""

League of Legends is a challenging PC game created by Riot, where professional players team up in groups of five to complete challenging feats, such as keeping their racist agenda off of twitter. The game has skyrocketed from after-school activity to worldwide Esport in a matter of years. With players around the globe and rewards of up to 500,000 dollars, Daryl might have made the biggest mistake of his life.

His sister, Emily, had only invectives. ""I'm scared for him, I seriously am. He's going to put all his life and energy into this degree. Who will support him? What if he doesn't make it in the scene? I'm wishing he would have spoken to us before throwing his life away.""

And now it is. By uninstalling League, Thunderson Jr. has sentenced his Gold III legacy to collect dust and become forgotten, like Ozymandias, or Origen's trophy shelf. It can only be imagined what Thunderson could have accomplished, what insights his Lee Sin OTP could have provided to a scene that many claim has become ""dehydrated"" since season three. What if he became the new insec? What if, in the best timeline, we would all be crying out that a player has just ""done a Thunderson,"" when they hit a perfect kick? Not anymore. Not anymore.

The story is a bitter reminder of such champion players as Krepo, who retired his career to become an announcer and beloved personality. As well as all those poor members of Team Liquid, who--oh, sorry, my crystal ball turned on somehow.

At press time, everyone was relieved to know Daryl was not leaving League forever. ""I just want to make a decent client,"" he told reporters.

"[BILD] Harry Kane on if he's annoyed with 0 trophies: ""That has been my goal at Tottenham year after year. We came very close to win a title & had really good years. It was a pity that we never made it to the finish line. Now I want to fight for all trophies. That will bring me forward as a player.""","The rest of Harry Kane's quotes in his interview with BILD (Tobi Altschäffl & Christian Falk)

------

>**On why he decided to join Bayern Munchen**

>""I felt it was time for me to take the next step in my career. I wanted this experience, to fight for titles, for the Champions League. Playing for a club as huge as Bayern is an insane challenge. I was thinking less about the league and more about FC Bayern: How can I get better? Bayern is the perfect club for me here.

>""I've always followed Bayern in the Champions League, and Bundesliga matches. As a footballer, I like to watch the games of the best teams, including Bayern. I also spoke a lot with coach Thomas Tuchel beforehand: he told me which system he would like to play, what makes sense based on the type of player. Before the move, I was intensively involved with FC Bayern. Thomas also showed me exactly where he sees me, my positioning. I want to understand my teammates: what sets them apart, what drives them. I'm learning every day right now. I hope that this connection will become really strong in the coming months.""

>**On the biggest difference between the Premier League and the Bundesliga** 

>""The atmosphere in Bremen was incredible, very different from England and the Premier League. It was a Bundesliga game, but it felt like a big European night, like a Champions League game. The match was a high-paced game. Bremen played man to man, aggressively with the defensive line pushed forward. There were also many counterattacks. There are few teams in the Premier League that act like that. But what was really impressive was the high tempo and the atmosphere. I have to adapt to it. But I feel like I can compete in any league, in any country. It's amazing to add this experience to my resume""

>**On the conversation he had with Rummenigge before his move to Bayern**

>""Mr. Rummenigge explained to me how the club is managed and how important the fans are. That the club is like a family: Almost everyone in the club knows everyone. The fans get very close to us players. But he also explained to me how big the pressure is at Bayern: trophies are expected here - actually more than just one. Before the first game, there was also this special extra pressure: we have to win. That's the mentality here. There is only one way at Bayern: win. Karl-Heinz Rummenigge explained that very well. And this FC Bayern mentality will make me better as a player and help me progress""

>**On Bayern fans**

>""It feels like there's a very strong connection with the fans here - a family. At first I could hardly believe it when I saw there were normal residential buildings on the other side of Säbener Straße. This is unique. The fans are such a big part of a football club, they're with us through thick and thin. Getting in touch with them - through an autograph, a photo or a short conversation - is important and not a problem for me at all.""


>**On his personality**

>""I think I'm a down to earth person. I never forget where I come from. I remember well how I used to look up to stars like David Beckham. Back then, 10 seconds with one of these stars would have meant the world to me. I'm now trying to give the kids in particular who are waiting for me a memory they will remember for a lifetime.""


>**On the [old photo](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F4fHz96WsAAdqL1?format=jpg&name=small) alongside his wife Kate with David Beckham:**

>""That was a great moment for me. Back then, David Beckham opened an academy for kids, to which we were invited as a school class and were allowed to train with him there. I was eleven years old. My wife and I have known each other since we were 5 years old, almost our entire lives. We started dating when we were 18. But we had a lot of contact before that.""

>**On his newborn baby**

>""We have decided that the birth would take place in the familiar environment in London. But Henry is coming soon with his mother and three siblings and will grow up speaking German. His German will one day be better than mine. (laughs)""

>**On Thomas Tuchel and how he convinced Kane to join Bayern** 

>""We've met a few times in the Premier League. When we met in the summer, I was immediately struck by his energy. Thomas Tuchel is bursting with ideas, he has a great personality. It's important to me to have a good relationship with the coach. The foundation for that was laid early on. Thomas speaks his mind straight to your face - and he wants you to do the same to him. The human as well as the professional side just fit between us""

>Thomas wanted to get to know me first and told me why he wanted me at Bayern. In the same meeting, however, he went into great detail: where exactly does he see me and that I should play as a clearer #9 than I often do at Tottenham. My role there was a bit different, I dropped deep more often. With players like Leroy Sané, Kingsley Coman or Serge Gnabry on the wings, a team can attack quickly – that allows me to position myself in the center of the penalty box. I can adapt to that. Even the playing styles of the England national team and Tottenham were different and that was never a problem for me.""

>**On Thomas Müller**

>""A great guy who took very good care of me from the start. On the pitch, he really does everything with his eyes, his head, this unique intuition. He's seen so many players come and go at Bayern Munich. And yet he approached me immediately with his openness. He can push the whole team with his experience and I'm looking forward to getting to know him better""

>**On his 100 million euro price tag** 

>""I'm extremely grateful to Bayern for never giving up. They have great faith in me. But I don't want to look at the number too much. I'm here now, on the pitch, in the dressing room. I want to help, be a leader, score goals. I don't have the transfer fee in mind, that doesn't change my approach.""

>**On if he will be used as a classic #9 or a playmaker at Bayern**

>""I can play both. When Christian Eriksen and Dele Alli played as #10 at Tottenham, I was more of a classic #9 there. In Thomas Tuchel's system at FC Bayern, I'll be a clear #9. But I also love serving my team-mates with passes, like in the first goal in Bremen. If an opponent is playing man-to-man, I can drop more into midfield to give space to the wingers.""

>**On Gerd Muller and Robert Lewandowski**

>Gerd Müller was one of the greatest strikers ever. I've watched a lot of his videos on YouTube and know some of his records. But I will certainly get to know the history of this absolute legend even better here. I also admired Robert Lewandowski as a young player, he took a fantastic path and set unbelievable records. I want to reach his level - and maybe even better.""

>**On extending his prime longevity into his 30s**

>""I know that when you turn 30 as a footballer, people somehow always have retirement in the back of their minds. But I would like to play at the top level for another 7-8 years. And the example of Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Karim Benzema or Lewandowski shows that it is absolutely possible to achieve top performances when you are a footballer. The decision for FC Bayern was not made because of time pressure, but out of conviction.""

>**On being an inspiration for other young English players who wants to live abroad**

>""Maybe my journey here can be an inspiration for younger English players to do the same and take that step. I can remember David Beckham making the move from Manchester United to Real Madrid. I was a kid and I was like, 'Wow, what an amazing experience.' Maybe I took Beckham as an example: I always wanted to see a different league, a different environment. So far it's going great: on and off the pitch. I'm happy when my wife and our four children come to Munich from London and we move into a house. That should happen in the next six weeks""

>**On the 2024 CL final at Wembley** 

>""It would be an absolute dream to play this game in my home country. There are still a few months to go before then. But we can go far with our team in the Champions League.""",https://www.bild.de/bild-plus/sport/fussball/bayern-muenchen/fc-bayern-harry-kane-verraet-im-interview-alles-85188548.bild.html,TheBiasedSportsLover,2023-08-28 14:09:23,5944,soccer
Actually real Destiny facts (Get Fact Edition),"Following the insane amount of love I got for the last post, I will continue. A reminder that everything I write is true, regardless of how stupidly I write it.

- In Destiny 1 we had three major Fallen houses, House of Kings, House of Devils, and House of Wolves, and two minors in House of Exile and House of Winter

- In Destiny 2 we have House of Dusk, which is implied to be all of the broken houses coming together.

- Fallen Captains have four arms

- Fallen Vandals have four arms

- Fallen Dregs have two and a 2/5ths arms

- Fallen can regenerate their arms

- Fallen arms get cut off (Dregs) to denote rank

- Fallen Dregs in the House of Dusk had their arms previously removed, but are allowed to regrow them. They do not have a cap on them like Dregs in D1 did. The cap prevented regrowth. When you zoom in on Dregs now, you can see they are very close to regrowing the hand back.

- Fallen sizes depend on how much Ether they consume. Kells consume the most, Captains next, then Vandals, and then Dregs.

- Ether is controlled by Servitors

- Servitors are purple machine balls

- These purple machine balls were made to look in the Traveler's image

- The Traveler was once with the Fallen at their homeworld, but fled when the Collapse hit them (the Great Whirlwind)

- The Traveler was known as the Great Machine by the Fallen

- The Fallen's race is called the Eliksni. They were given the name Fallen because they had ""Fallen"" from what they once were. They were once a proud people, but following the events of the Great Whirlwind, they have lost their honor and became thieves and scavengers.

- House Judgment, Variks' house, remembers the ways of the old, and wishes the Fallen would reach the same point by joining together.

- Variks is the only living member of House Judgement

- Variks is not the Spider

- The Spider is a thicc boi

- The Spider is does not believe in the practices of other houses, he does not cut their arms off, and treats them fairly. 

- The Spider has a collection of Dead Ghosts

- The Spider is a collector of Antique Human Paintings (like Starry Night)

- Fikruul is not the Spider

- Fikruul is also known as the Fanatic

- The Fanatic was once a Fallen Archon

- The Amethyst Crystal at the tip of his spear was a gift from the Awoken

- The Awoken were known for giving these crystals to Archons as political gifts

- The Awoken are blue

- The Awoken who aren't Guardians remember who they were before becoming Awoken. Some even know current Guardians before they were Guardians. Sedia knew Zavala before he became one.

- Sjur Eido was once sent to assassinate Mara Sov

- Instead Sjur and Uldren fought eachother across various 1v1 battles. It ended in a tie, and Sjur dropped her ambition to kill Mara, eventually becoming her very close friend (and lover) as well as becoming the first Queen's Wrath

- The Emissary was once named Nasya Sarwar, then Orin when she became a Guardian after being murdered by Risen

- Orin has a tattoo of a snake coiled on her arm. This is where the symbol for Gambit came from.

- Orin and the Drifter were very good friends (most likely more then that) and served together in what was known as the Pilgrim Guard.

- Shaxx was once a Warlord, a group of tyrannical Risen that met odds with the Iron Lords. However, we do not know if he was a particularly bad one. But he does love to fight.

- Saladin's last name is Forge

- Saladin likes doggos

- Those doggos are actually wolves

- There are a handful of wolves at the Iron Temple, and Saladin is often accompanied by one.

- Felwinter, an Exo, was known for being the John Wick of the Iron Lords. He broke rules and gave a lot of Risen their final deaths (killing them and their ghosts).

- Lady Efrideet, a former Iron Banner Vendor, had gone missing and was presumed dead. When she resurfaced at the Iron Temple, she expressed that she had become a pacifist and was leading a civilian group deep in the solar system.

- Saint-14 was a badass

- Saint-14 looked at Osiris as his father figure, and learned a lot from him. The fire in his heart is attributed to the fire in Osiris'

- Saint-14 once killed a Fallen Kell by headbutting him.

- Saint-14 could only be killed when the Vex created a Mind that was capable of sucking his light from him. Even then, he killed hundreds of thousands of Vex. Because of this the Vex created a tomb for him, out of reverance, and placed a Reverance Mind outside of it to protect it.

- Saint-14 was given his shotgun, Perfect Paradox, by us. We gave it to him so that he could give it to us, so we could give it to him so we could...

- One Eyed Mask is from a Guardian who was captured by Red Legion soldiers, they proceeded to break his ghost and remove one of his eyes. They then threw him off a cliff. He then found them and killed them with his bare hands, as he had lost his light following the Traveler being trapped.

- Lucky Pants are an awful exotic

- Izanagi's Burden was the weapon used by Ada-1 to kill a group of Risen who had been following her and her mother. She used it to give them their final deaths.

- Ada-1 was a young girl before suffering a soon to be fatal injury during the Collapse. In order to save her, they transferred her conscience into an Exo body at Niobe Labs.

- Her name was Adelaide, and she was French

- She is one of the few people who had an account of what happened during the Collapse

- The entity that attacked them at Niobe Labs was described as smelling like wet earth. They never saw it, they were shooting blindly from cover. 

- Ada-1 does not trust Guardians, or Risen, because of everything that happened to her and the founder of the Black Armory. (she regains trust after the events of the Season of the Forge)

- If you complete all of the quests associated with Black Armory, you give Ada-1 an object known as the Obsidian Accelerator. This was what the Risen were after. She installs it and begins to glow, similar to the Radiance effect we get on our weapons.

- This allows Ada-1 to effectively become a mobile forge. Being able to create weapons from her hands.

- Why do I have to keep going for forges if she is a forge bungo

- Following the events of the Tower siege, loss of light, Red War, and many other events, Tess has still not received word from Fenchurch

- No one has any idea who Fenchurch is, just that he/she supplied Tess with her stock.

- Riven is an Ahamkara, who was Taken but kept her own autonomy.

- Riven arrived at the Dreaming City in the palm of Uldren's hand.

- Ahamkara are shape shifters, and can take on basically any form they choose.

- Riven chooses to look that way because of the legends regarding ""Wish Dragons' and because it's intimidating

- Saladin once wished to fight a dragon during the Great Hunt, so an Ahamkara took that form.

- Riven is assumed to be from Jupiter, or near there. Her existence has been hinted at since Destiny 1.

- Mara was okay with helping Guardians kill all of the Ahamkara, because that would mean she held the last living one, and that gave her power.

- The Wall of Wishes was created by Mara so she could wish for things without saying words, so that Riven could not fill in the gaps and take advantage of it.

- The Ahamkara can still talk to people, and subject people to visions, in death. Holding or being in possession or near bones will result in the person hearing whispers.

- I hope you're enjoying this thread, o reader mine

- The Ahamkara know that we are players. As in, they know Destiny is a game and want to leave it and enter the real world.

- Just by thinking and reading anything Ahamkara related is making them real in the real world

- When in past Mercury, you can see the Traveler in the distance

- Malfeasance was created as a way to beat The Man with the Golden Gun. Because the more people that have it, the easier it is to kill. You don't need one person to land the killing blow, all you need is people to just hit the target, and boom.

- The Man with the Golden Gun is known as the Renegade

- The Renegade is also known as Shin Malphur, as well as being Dredgen Vale, and Zyre Orsa.

- Rezzyl Azzir, a champion of the Crucible, and a beloved Guardian went to the Moon to slay nightmares. He encountered a hive knight, who he killed. He took his trophies and put them on his trusty hand cannon, Rose.

- He was corrupted by whispers and promises of strength, thus becoming what he is more widely known as being, Dredgen Yor

- Rezyl Azzir was a Titan, not a Hunter as most believed. He wore a cloak, however.

- Dregden Yor killed Jaren Ward, and gave the Last Word to Shin Malphur, as a way of starting his road to vengeance.

- Jaren Ward was Shin's mentor, and was known for being a legendary gunslinger, with his trust hand cannon, The Last Word.

- Crux Lomar, a weapon manufacturer, is known for making items such a Truth, and more famously, Gjallarhorn.

- Gjallarhorn was made in commemoration of those who died during the battle of the Twilight Gap.

- Six Fronts is symbolized in the symbol for Titans, as they were the Hero's of the battle. It's in 4 sections for the 4 orders of Titans that held during the battle (Pilgrim Guard, Firebreakers, Stoneborn and First Pillar)

- Shaxx and Saladin are not the greatest of friends, because Shaxx went against a director order from Saladin (then Vanguard Leader), and underwent a counter attack against the Fallen during the Battle of the Twilight Gap. This ultimately was what one the battle.

- Devrim Kay is, well, Devrim Gay (Pride Month y'all)

- Mara Sov was the first Awoken.

- Elsie Bray, sister of Anna Bray, is the Exo Stranger we met in Destiny 1

- Toland, before we knew what he was, assisted us during the Taken King, specifically during our Raid to slay Oryx, King of the Taken. He was the ball of light guiding us through.

- Toland, the Shattered, was in Eris' fireteam that went to try and slay Crota. They failed, and Toland was killed by Ir Yut (who we later slay right before fighting Crota).

- They went to the Moon to slay Crota out of revenge for the Great Disaster, and event where Crota slayed thousands of Guardians.

- Nokris is is Crota's brother and disowned son of Oryx

- Oryx tried to wipe Nokris from Hive records because he renounced the Sword Logic and began practicing Necromancy.

- In order to learn this power (in a similar way Anakin tried to learn from Palpatine) he sought out Xol, the weakest of the Worm Gods.

- There are 5 core known Worm Gods, Xol, Akka, Eir, Yul, and Ur.

- Akka was slain by Oryx, and it's corpse was used to make the Dreadnaught

- Worm Gods are aligned with the Deep, and the Traveler with the Sky.

- The Leviathan, Calus' ship, is named after a mythical beast of the Fundament.

- The Fundament are referred to as the ""Proto-Hive"", as they would become the Hive following their interactions with the Worms.

**BELOW THIS ARE THE ONES FROM THE OTHER THREAD**

- A guardian named Serenity died nearly 100,000 times, and lost her mind. She went on a rampage in Storm Caller in a mainly uninhabitated part of the city, no one was killed, but was captured and now receiving help.

- Zavala once loved a mortal woman named Lindiwe. She died of old age, and watching her slowly fade away killed Zavala, as he is a Guardian and does not age. Because of this Zavala has avoided relationships since, as he feels he cannot carry another burden, let alone just one.

- The only time we know of Shaxx ever removing his helmet, was when Zavala was spreading Lindiwe's ashes, as a sign of respect.

- Shaxx is a player, and is known for being romantically involved with both Guardians and Mortals

- Shaxx has never had a bad break up, all of them still love him.

- Shaxx lost his horn after getting his buns beat in Crucible by Ikora.

- Good guy Shaxx once held a dying Ahamkara in his arms, so that it could die peacefully.

- Cool guy Shaxx can recite poetry by heart

- Alpha Male Shaxx banged Mara, and then got her a Recurve Bow as a gift.

- Shaxx loves doggos (Luna's Howl steps)

- Shaxx and Sjur were good friends, their first interaction resulted in Sjur killing Shaxx with a bow when he was caught trespassing on Awoken space.

- Sjur and Mithraax were also very close friends. Sjur captured Mithraax and brought him to the Dreaming City, eventually releasing him peacefully after catching Mithraax after he almost fell down the cliff at the Gardens in the DC. It is implied they accompanied each other for quite some time. Mithraax has gone to Sjur's rest with a fireteam to pay his respects to her.

- Cayde-6 does not know if Ace ever truly existed, it is possible that a previous version of himself made up the idea of Ace so that he could not lose touch of who he is, or his morality.

- Cayde-6 was the body guard for a prominant Ishtar scientist, Maya Sundaresh.

- Cayde-6 ran with the Drifter at some point in the past, to what extent we do not know yet.

- The Traveler was reffered to as ""Moon X"" when it was first discovered, it got it's name after during a basketball game involving the Ares crew. Evie came up with the name Traveler after one of them traveled.

- There was originally 4 members of the Ares One crew, however, you only see the 3 that made it in the opening Destiny trailer.

- Rasputin, in some form, was used for the Ares mission, and was kept extremely top secret. Only 2 members of the crew knew about it and it's full potential. More importantly that Rasputin was sentient.

- Evie (part of the crew) realized the ship AI (Rasputin) was creating assesments of the crew, the mission and itself, without any input. She became suspicious that Mihaylove was hiding something.

- Evie then died during an ""electrical fire"" accident the day of the launch, pushing it back a day. It is HEAVILY implied that Rasputin killed her because he found out about him and could potentially out his extremely dangerous capabilities.

- As a result of the push back the crew was armed for the mission.

- A former Hunter Vanguard Tallulah Fairwind, played poker with Caliban-8, and an Ahamkara posing as an old man. If Tallulah lost, the Ahamkara would feast. Ahamkara don't lose.

- An Ahamkara fullfilled Shinobu's by taking the form of her Mother. They spoke, and the Ahamkara said details about her life that made her believe it was her mother. All she wanted was to see her again. She cried when she allowed Nadiya to kill her, because all she saw was her mother smiling back.

- Calus' wine is made of planets.

- Calus castrated the Consul.

- The Consul is the guy who found Ghaul.

- Ghaul's teacher and father didn't have a dick.

- Match, Shadow Counselor to the True Emperor, was most likely the last person to ever see Calus in the flesh.

- Calus' proxy is described as being just as ""sensual"" as actual Calus, and even relaxed in the Royal Baths.

- Calus, upon finding out Match was worshipping his own religion in front of Calus, decided to build a temple for his so he can worship without fear. Calus only asked to be in his prayers.

- Calus is a good space dad

- Calus is a crazy space dad

- Uldren got rezzed as a LIGHT BEARER, by a Ghost named Pulled Pork

- Pulled Pork is kind of an idiot, or at the very least very unaware of a lot of things, naive.

- His name is Pulled Pork

- A guardian died after trying to pop their super while jumping off a building. They released they had lost their light, and subsequently fell to their death.

- The Drifter is a cool space uncle

- The Drifter is also a crazy space uncle

- The Drifter is Dredgen Hope, also known as Eli, also known as Wu Ming.

- The Drifter ran a bar for a while

- The Drifter eats a lot of crazy things because he was stuck on a frozen planet, constantly dying of starvation. That's why he has a lot of lines wondering how things taste.

- It is sort of implied that the Drifter and Emissary were previously lovers, or just extremely close friends (F for friend zone). Drifter is not exactly a big fan of the Nine because of what they did to her.

- The Nine released Skolas

- Skolas actually was a good guy. All he was trying to do was unite the Fallen so that they can return to their glory. Sure he did a lot of bad things but he was looking out for his people.

- Mithraax can one hit kill Dregs

- Variks was the person who released Uldren, and the Barons. He did it as a final thank you to his prince.

- Variks left the Prison of Elders with basically all of the Ether left. A vandal saw him on the way out, and basically wished him the best.

- Variks gave Cayde the most OP Destiny 1 weapon, Dreg's Promise, as a way to bribe him.

- Petra is missing an eye.

- Petra loves field work.

- Petra did not expect to be given the role of Queens Wrath following Sjur's death, making her the 2nd.

- Mara wasn't the first Awoken Queen. She was made Queen however following public approval, and because the previous Queen was too focused on clout and being regal.

- Eris is missing twice as many eyes as Petra, but also has three times as many eyes.

- Eris's eyes are Acolyte eyes

- Eris watched her entire team getting murdered and had her eyes cut out, and lost her connection to the Light. Had to crawl in the dark of the Hellmouth, found an Ahamkara bone, and has PTSD

- Oryx is transgender. Aurash was a woman, then became a man when she became Oryx

***SOME FUN STATS!!!***

* These players have won 44 league titles, 32 cup titles, 11 continental trophies, and 31 ""other"" trophies in 13 years
* Two of these players once played for the team that spanked Tottenham out of the Europa League this year.
* It all adds up to ~~118(EDIT 117) EDIT2: 118~~ EDIT3: **116 total trophies**, at the rate of about ~~9.08 EDIT: 9 EDIT2: 9.08~~ EDIT3: 8.92 trophies per season!
* This only includes trophies (and players) who have transferred *out* of Tottenham and won trophies, it does not take into account players (or trophies) won before their time in London.
* It *does* take into account players that were loaned out only to bring home silverware! Looking at you Fazio
* This list includes a CAF Champions League winner (Hossam Ghaly), an AFC Champions League winner (Paulinho), and two UEFA CL winners (Modrić, Bale)
* This list might grow by *three* in the next week!!! (Foyth, Trippier, Vertonghen)
* This list may not be complete, but I did click through every player profile in Transfermarkt

EDIT: Apologies, I made a mistake with Fernandes, it looks like he won the league before he joined Tottenham. It's only 28 players and 117 total trophies.

EDIT 2: Thanks to the kind user who pointed out that Llorente won the Italian Cup last year!

EDIT3: Cameron Lancaster's 2 USL cups probably shouldn't count here, since most of these are top flight trophies",https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/nerfc5/these_are_the_29_players_that_have_transferred/,tbendis,2021-05-18 01:47:34,5419,soccer
"Tonali: ""My grandma doesn't like, or rather, she didn't like football that much, but ever since I started playing she hasn't missed a single match. This makes me really happy. She often calls me after matches and during the week she asks me when I am playing and where she can watch it.""",".

Sandro Tonali has high hopes for Milan in the Champions League.

Milan midfielder Sandro Tonali knows all about what it means to succeed in the UEFA Champions League.

The 22-year-old was a young fan of the great Rossoneri side of the 2000s that reached three Champions League finals and lifted the trophy on two occasions. Now, he is part of the Milan team that has qualified for the competition's knockout stages for the first time since 2014.

This season, Milan navigated their way through a group stage containing Chelsea, Salzburg and Dinamo Zagreb. They then saw off Tottenham Hotspur in the round of 16, setting up a first foray into the last eight since 2012 and a date with Serie A rivals Napoli.

""It's nice to be back. All those years away haven't been good for AC Milan and its fans – they weren't good for anyone,"" Tonali assesses. ""It's really great to play these matches again and win again in the Champions League knockout phase. It's nice [for] the fans, who give us crazy energy. We're all together and playing Champions League games always feels incredible, especially in San Siro.""


When it comes to the supporters, few can understand them better than Tonali, who reminisces fondly over his side's past successes.

""It was an inexplicable feeling, I'm lucky I remember it,"" he recalls. ""I haven't just lived those moments without remembering them, especially 2007 [when Milan beat Liverpool in the final in Athens]. I remember a lot from that Champions League: the feelings, the celebrations...""

Tonali's transition from a fan to a darling of the San Siro was set in motion when he joined Milan from Brescia in 2020, the latest step in a journey that began playing football with friends and family in Sant'Angelo Lodigiano, a small town located around 30 kilometres south of Italy's second-biggest city.

""The very first memories I have about football there are connected to the neighbourhood, my passion for football was born there,"" he says. ""I have many memories, but the first one that comes to my mind is really the first kicks of a ball in the neighbourhood with my friends and my brother. It was normal to play football from the morning until the evening.""


Tonali has become a crucial part of the Milan team.

Things are a little different for the midfielder nowadays, but his number one fan remains the same – his grandmother, nonna Biagina.

""It is a unique relationship,"" he smiles. ""She doesn't like, or rather, she didn't like football that much, but ever since I started playing she hasn't missed a single match. This makes me really happy. She often calls me after matches and during the week she asks me when I am playing and where she can watch it.

""I am very close with my family because they have given a lot to me. They come to matches quite often, so I know they're at the home stadium for almost every game and that gives me an extra boost. It's always nice to know your family is in the stands – I'm proud of that.""

When Tonali lines up alongside his team-mates on Tuesday, with the Champions League anthem reverberating around the stadium, he will aim to follow in the footsteps of Milan icons like Paolo Maldini, Andrea Pirlo and Kaká, safe in the knowledge that he has plenty of support around him.",https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/0280-17cc71d523c1-265004fc659e-1000--milan-s-sandro-tonali-on-a-mission-to-emulate-champions-lea/,Samkazi23,2023-04-18 15:41:01,5423,soccer

[Translation] FPX.Tian: G2 were our scrim partners and we knew them very well,"Source:

(Tian's stream)[https://v.huya.com/play/232750012.html](https://v.huya.com/play/232750012.html)

(Crisp's stream)[https://v.huya.com/play/232758496.html](https://v.huya.com/play/232758496.html)

(Gimgoon's stream)[https://v.huya.com/play/232725314.html](https://v.huya.com/play/232725314.html)

Today, FPX players are back to Shanghai and everyone except for DoinB streamed. They did some VOD review of the games and played some league. Below are the summary of some of the things they said that might be interesting.

**Warning: FPX players really like to troll, so don't take everything 100%.**

## About scrims:

* (Gimgoon, Tian, Crisp)FPX had been scrimming with G2 ever since they arrived in Europe on Oct 2nd and **G2 was the team they scrimmed the most with**, so they knew G2 very well. They won most of the scrims too, like 9/10 of them.
* (Tian)They did well in their scrims pre-tournament against all regions, so they got cocky and thought they would have a deep run; especially LWX. However, LWX inted his brain out in their first game with JT and they lost, so they became quite pessimistic. \[From Weibo source: **Tian apparently studied the route to swim back to China from Berlin.**\]
* (Crisp) G2 were like their brothers. They scrimmed so much and they have similar read on meta, so when the quarters draw came out, he thought both G2 and FPX would be knocked out. Didn't expect to meet them in the final at all. They also lost to SKT 1-5 in scrims after group stage, which was also part of why they thought they would go home before every BO5, and never felt they could win the whole thing, until G2 knocked out SKT. (Crisp, Tian)Then they suddenly felt they had a good shot. 
* (Crisp) **SKT was destroying teams in scrims. FPX beat every other team in scrims, including IG, but not SKT.** **He had no idea how SKT got knocked out by G2, but he discovered after watching the semi-final series that SKT didn't look that strong.**
* (Crisp) The week before the final, FPX scrimmed with a team that was around 4th/5th in LEC. They played 6 games and that's all they got. \[To clarify, his exact words were 'an EU team at 4-5 place whose name I don't remember now' and I was assuming he meant LEC, but it's possible he didn't mean that.\]

## About EUW experience:

* (Gimgoon and Tian) People tried to tilt them in ranked games, spamming things like ‘you will go 0-6 in groups’, ‘FNC will 3-0 you’, ‘G2 will 3-0 FPX’. The week before the final, it became so disgusting that in every game there were people trolling/feeding and it was very obvious. Their teammates would said they’re happy even if they lost.
* (Gimgoon) They couldn’t do anything because they were using super accounts given by Riot. Otherwise, he would do nasty things that he couldn’t describe in streams.
* (Tian)**The funniest thing was, in the morning of the final, he was in a game against LWX and Crisp. The game was not going well and the enemy team was sieging for their base. Then his screen went black, and when he re-connected, the game was already lost. Because it seemed like he stood in the fountain for 2 minutes, his teammates were cheering in the chat that FPX jungler went mental boomed and afked. Then he proceeded to 3-0 G2.**

## About the skins:

* (Tian) Riot asked them to submit 3 champions that they wanted skins for in order. **He chose Lee Sin, Elise and Qiyana.** Now he doesn't think Qiyana is a good idea, because once she is nerfed a bit and pros stop using her, players won’t play her anymore. **He really wants Lee Sin now,** and will protest if he doesn't get one. **His teammates picked shitty champions that wouldn’t sell, the shittest of the shits like GP, Malphite, Galio and he felt he needed to choose something popular to boost the sales. His teammates should be thankful for that, since everyone gets a share from the total skin sales.** Doinb wanted a Yasuo skin, but he never played it so he's probably trolling.
* (LWX) His skin is most likely Vayne. His list is probably Kai’sa, Vayne, or Lucian. ""Nobody will ever get a skin for Varus, because he is a handicapped champion. I don’t use Varus even once in like 500 ranked games.""
* (Crisp) He wanted Pyke, but not sure if he could get it since he didn't play Pyke. If he couldn't, he would get Thresh or Naut. It's true that he wanted   
Thresh to dance the Kpop Nayana dance when basing.
* (Tian)”Anyone else think that LWX doesn't deserve a Kai'sa skin? I deleted my social media apps before the tournament, planning to focus on training, but my friend told me, after LWX inted his brain out and we lost the first game, “LWX” became the No.2 top search word on Weibo, and I was so curious that I re-downloaded the app to see how people flamed him. It was quite a fun read.“

## About the games:

(Tian) They had special picks prepared for worlds but they won without using them. One of the secret picks he had was Taliyah. (He then played a game of Taliyah, won in 17 min.)

(Tian) The strongest opponent they faced was IG. EU teams weren't used to their style, and the players were individually worse.

## JT vs FPX:

* (Tian) “This game was so un-lose-able. We had three infernals! I read people's comments about comp lacking damage etc, but did you see that we were still very close to winning even with an inting Kai'sa? When the Kai'sa inted like that and we still could have won, that means the team comp has no problem...Honestly it's a good thing that LWX inted and we kind of got a wake up call at the very beginning. Otherwise we might not be able to win the whole thing.""

## FNC vs FPX:

* (Tian) “How did we win the FNC game? Well…they seemed really confident in the things they played, like TF, Yummi Garen…But we’re confident on our style, too. So let’s just see who do it better.”

## IG vs FPX:

* (Tian) “I don’t want to review them because I didn’t do well in the first two games.“
* (Gimgoon) “I did poorly in the quarter-final, and I thought to myself, if I didn’t do well in the semi-final, I would just retire. But then, I did okay in the semi and the final, so I will not retire. I will play for at least one more year and maybe two.” (Then he proceeded to open his LoL client and saw that he's currently at plat) ""Okay I am plat, I am not qualified to be a pro player. I am retiring now.”
* (Gimgoon) ""IG banned 3 ADCs against LWX. They looked down upon LWX's Ezreal…emmmm…I agree with IG.""

## G2 vs FPX:

## Game 1

* (Tian)**They had seen the Pyke mid in scrims and expected the Veigar pick in final too.**
* (Tian)""We knew they wanted to play Pyke mid, but didn't expect it in the first game. They probably felt it's hard to win against us so they were going all in. We should have made the Ryze top useless, but it wasn't that successful. We should have ganked more. Gimgoon kind of fuck it up.""
* (Tian) In Game 1, G2 had midgame advantages because FPX’s comp lacked damage in midgame.
* (Gimgoon) ""DoinB is god-tier Ryze and my Ryze is meh. If we get Ryze we will play it mid, but enemy teams thought we might flex it.""
* (Tian) **""It's good that we won the first game...so the following games were easier. Had we lost Game 1, the series would not have been so smooth. It would have been 3-1 instead of 3-0.""**

## Game 2

* (Tian) ""In the second game, both teams got the composition they wanted, so it's a matter of who did it better.""
* (Tian) ""This is another incomprehensible play from LWX. I still don't understand why LWX based and got a stopwatch then used it here. The only thing he did after getting out of base, was to jump in the baron pit, throw two skillshots and used the stopwatch. Did he worry that Tristana would ult and Yasuo would come and kill him? We killed Yasuo sure, but Yasuo was worth 274 while the stopwatch was worth 600. This is the second most unforgivable play from LWX in the series.""
* (Tian) The whole team was too focused so they didn’t notice Perkz typing ‘1v1’ in all chat during Game 2 of the final. But Perkz is a happy man and he would do similar things in scrims. \[If anyone doesn’t know, Tian duo-queued with Perkz in EUW, and before the semis, he played URF with other G2 players.\]
* (Tian) ""Every single time when we tried to end the game, we had to keep begging LWX to hit the nexus not the enemies. Something’s wrong with this man. ""

## Game 3

* (Tian) “Honestly this is the first time we got the first turret before I even got lv5. I didn't know what to do.”
* \[Contribution of u/Asshoho\](Tian) ""Lwx stay too long at the mid for that one more hit to turret and i gave the first blood to protect him, so he can be deathless. This is the first unforgivable play from LWX in the series, I will never forget this in my entire life.""
* (Tian) FPX had big early lead but G2 did well in stalling the game. They traded the drake for the baron which was the winning decision.
* (Tian) ""AD is such an easy role. Your teammates come to you, and you throw some skills and pick up kills. Look LWX just Q twice and got a double. Look LWX just picked up a kill with one Kai'sa W. At this point LWX said 'go away, I want the turret plates for myself', but DoinB said 'I can't defend mid turret anymore, I need the turret plates too'. Then Crisp and I said we could defend the mid turret and proved it's just an excuse to get a share of the turret plates. Such conspiracy goes on everyday in our team.""
* (Tian) “LWX probably calculated and got Gimgoon killed 3 seconds before the end of final, too, so that he would be the only deathless member in the series.”

## Topicless

* (Tian) **FNC mid talking shit after losing(worst mid in tournament) was like a 3-year-old baby trying to fight a primary school kid, got beat up and cried to his parents:”He’s so weak. If I were the same age I would beat the shit out of him!""**
* (Tian) **“When they announced the FMVP, LWX questioned if they gave the FMVP to the wrong person. Our coach was so disgusting too. He said 'Oh? Really? Is there something wrong?’ after I got the trophy.“**
* (LWX) ""I did calculation, if we're knocked out in group stage, I would have 40 days off; if we're knocked out in quarters, 33 days; semis, a bit over 20. Too bad we were the champion and I only get 10 days off.""
* (Jackeylove) ""LWX had 6.1 kills per game? Oh I guess we gave them a lot of kills in the semis...they were killing us like killing chickens, playing to boost their KDA. Perkzzie? He is actually great, but he's unlucky that he met someone stronger. If Perkz had met me, I would be the one typing 1v1 in all chat.""
* Tian when counting how many jungle camps Doinb took from him: ""Oh thank god this time it’s the enemy team taking the river crab.""

[Effort Post] How Simulating 400 Million battles tells us how to fix Ladder,"# Introduction:

Edit: There seems to be an issue where some users cannot see the text.  I am removing the royaleapi link to see if this resolves anything

TL;DR at the bottom

On this subreddit, there are countless posts about overleveled cards and ladder matchmaking.  In this post, I will detail how I built and used a computational model of the ladder to determine which model parameters minimized card level differences

The guiding principles that I looked for in a ladder model were this:

* The ladder should minimize card level differences for as many players as possible
* The players should not be clumped around a certain trophy level
* The ladder should work on a long term
* Level 14 players with fully maxed decks (modeled as 112 card levels) should reach the top
* The top of the ladder should be between 8000 and 8500

After testing 28 different models of ladder, the design that most accurately fit the aforementioned principles was a system where card levels (notably not king level) was capped by league and inflation *remains unchanged.*

# How this investigation was done:

**Simplifying Assumptions**

Since this is a computational model, there had to be some assumptions.  For the testing different ladders phase they were:

* There is no 2v2. All players play ladder exclusively
* Players are \*always\* matched  with someone that is within 40 trophies of them, regardless on position on ladder
* All players hit cancel within 5s when king tower matchmaking active
* A season is about 4 million battles for 25000 players
* There is an even distribution of players at king tower 8,9,10,11,12,13 amd 14.
* The card level on a player of each king tower level is evenly distributed\*

When 2 players face each other, the chance of the overleveled player winning can be approximated (R\^2 for the regression was 0.9933) by the equation 0.0186\*lvlDiff + 0.521. With equal levels, I made this a 50/50 coin toss for testing different models.  The card level approximation is from 90k real matches.

**Data Collection Process**

First I created a set of ""baseline data"" where I ran 25000 players starting at 5000 through a simulation of 10 million battles. I used the inflation that is currently in the game (80% loss from 5000-5300, 90% loss from 5600-6000), turned king tower matchmaking off and reset it to create the starting point for all of the tests conducted.  This data is stored in the file 'baselineData.csv'

This is 2 of the graphs I generated from the data:

&#x200B;

*Processing img p4ylvuc4j5a81...*

&#x200B;

*Processing img 22ecj8bcj5a81...*

Now with the baseline data, I could do a season reset (with reset numbers from royaleapi)

The first ""test"" I did was test the current ladder.  I used +-1 king tower matchmaking, the same inflation from the current ladder and king tower matchmaking ending at 6000 trophies.  Any model that is ""better"" than the current ladder needs to have lower card level difference and more separation between the players when I run it through the same condition, which is 4 million battles.

[King level distribution by Trophies currently](https://preview.redd.it/18l7918e9ka81.png?width=1248&format=png&auto=webp&s=21109b5c3a445432b613b6bc5c85d2f7ae18c528)

*Processing img d6xb9nfxl5a81...*

Looking at the upper graph, its clear that the current ladder system with king tower mm and inflation running to 6000 trophies brings players to 6k very easily, and many get stuck there.  This results in a spike of card level differences and general ""unfairness"" as a player reaches the 6k mark.

To try to fix the ladder, the 6k spike needs to be lowered.  To do this, I tested these conditions:  (All the data is in one of the csv files [here](https://github.com/NovaLight53/CRLadder))

* Trophy gates at 5000, 5300, 5600 with no inflation
* Trophy gates at 5000, 5600, 6300 with no inflation
* Matches based of card levels with max difference of 8
* Levels capped by league, starting at lvl 8 at 5k (This worked the best)
* Levels are capped by league, starting at level 11 at 5k. Normal Inflation
* Levels are capped by a player's king tower
* Levels capped by league starting @ level 8, inflation by card level difference
* Opponents have an equal king tower, no +- 1
* Constant 90% trophy loss from 5-6k, no King tower matchmaking (KT mm)
* Constant 90% trophy loss from 5k-6k, king tower mm to 5600
* Constant 90% trophy loss from 5-6k, king tower mm to 6600
* 90% trophy loss from 5000-5300 and 5600-6000, 100% trophy loss elsewhere
   * Tested with no KT mm, KT mm cutoff at 5600, 6000, 6600
* Inflation expanded to up to 7k
   * Done in 3 ways, with and without KT mm to 6k
      * Constant 90% loss from 5k-7k, (Not tested with KTMM)
      * 5000-5600: 70% loss, 5600-6300: 80% loss, 6300-7k: 90% loss
      * 5000-5600: 80% loss, 5600-6300: 85% loss, 6300-7k: 90% loss
* Inflation by card level difference
* Inflation by Card and King level difference (no max trophy cap for inflation)
   * This was tested across 5 seasons since it too worked remarkably well
* Loss percent based off a sine function
* Ladder with no rules, just trophy mm
* Trophy caps every half league (lvl 8 below 5k, lvl 9 at 5150, lvl 10 at 5300 etc)

**Notes on Data Collection**

In many of these tests, I address inflation, or losing less than you would normally lose. Loss percent means the percent of trophies you lose from 30. (90% loss percent means +30, -27). From the december 2020 change that was reverted, its clear that inflation is a necessary evil.  The puzzle is managing it so that it doesn't harm players.

Also note that many of these ideas did not end up very well and had did worse in terms of level disparity, low level players getting to the top or a large clumping of players.

I did not combine king tower mm and card level matchmaking.  As u/notkasa said, ""Each time you add a new rule, it takes more and more time to the algorithm."" (from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClashRoyale/comments/rvghl1/explaining_the_matchmaking/)).  King level matchmaking required 7 separate mm queues\*\* and card level matchmaking required 53 queues.  To combine them in my model, I would need 371 separate queues, which takes significant memory and inhibits performance. The amount of searching to find a match doubled for KT mm and went up even further for card level matchmaking, and combining them makes it even slower.

**Technical side of this project**

None of this segment is necessary for understanding the idea of fixing the ladder.  This segment is for those interested in understanding the back end of what I did here and how it can be used for future projects.

The code for this project is broken up into 2 files: A player class and a simulation file.

The player class includes the player object with attributes ID, trophies, wins, losses,king tower, card level, total level difference, skill and party percent.  The class methods allow me to update the attributes after a trophy reset or after a game.  The number won and lost is from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClashRoyale/comments/l8teow/effort_post_what_an_analysis_of_30000_battles/). The non class methods are for tweaking inflation and other parameters, along with creating player objects with specified card levels for their decks.

The simulation file contains 4 simulations plus a final simulation, which I will discuss later on.

Each simulation goes through these steps.

1. Initializes the queue or dictionary of queues.
2. Picks a random player.
3. Looks through the queue(s) per the matchmaking rules.
4. If an opponent is found, play a match and remove the opponent from the queue. Repeat back to step 2 until the correct number of matches have been played
5. If an opponent is not found, then add it to the appropriate queue in the correct spot. (Since mm is always based on trophies, queues are sorted by trophies to take advantage of binary search). Repeat back to step 2.
6. Sort the player array by trophies and return it.

Further Optimizations:  I used a numpy array for my matchmaking queue and appended it when adding a new player.  Appending these arrays is slow.  The fix would be to use a binary search tree to retain logarithmic opponent finding time (per queue) and make appending to the queue faster.

# Analysis:

For each ladder change I tested, I created 6 graphs:

* A bar graph showing Average level difference per match (a measure of ladder fairness) vs king tower
* A bar graph of avg lvl difference/match vs card level.
* A histogram showing the number of players of each king tower over their trophies
* A histogram showing the number of players of each card level (range of 4 levels) over their trophies
* A scatterplot of card levels vs trophies
* A scatterplot of level difference/match vs trophies.

All the graphs are in [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CHU0G91LFywfS3vopuql1Bqid3Jk-137e4zhq3NhwQo/edit?usp=sharing) document.  I will not detail of them since some are quite similar to each other and many are worse than the current ladder.

The first change I tested was merely removing the KT mm rule and not touching inflation.

[Level Difference\/match vs trophies](https://preview.redd.it/rmfauaurb6a81.png?width=427&format=png&auto=webp&s=2699a8920dfbe0517f3f9ebb5ef3d113dce3a16a)

&#x200B;

[The players are nicely spread out across the trophy ranges ](https://preview.redd.it/jwiwo0rob6a81.png?width=1176&format=png&auto=webp&s=197b34c4afb6d7d11ae26b5ed82d25eace906a6b)

From these two graphs alone, the distribution of players is nice, but at 6k, the card level differences are about 3x as bad as before, meaning this is definitely not the way to fix the ladder.

Another popular suggestion on this sub is card level based matchmaking. Here is what happened on the moderate 4 million battle test where the max card level difference is 4.

[Trophy distribution shown with card levels. ](https://preview.redd.it/1s2mo2r8f6a81.png?width=1176&format=png&auto=webp&s=82b5d6fd2938343ab612d14cbe17f500c8ed0c47)

&#x200B;

[A significant number of players get stuck far lower than they should be](https://preview.redd.it/4es8mdeof6a81.png?width=586&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8747e28bf9997fae4842dcc4f64ab32ba8e5e8e)

Although the distribution of players is quite good, there are many players that are stuck far too low because of their high card levels. In other words, players are penalized for upgrading cards.

It has also been proposed that players card levels are capped by their king tower.

[Card level difference vs trophies](https://preview.redd.it/b66n26cmg6a81.png?width=430&format=png&auto=webp&s=2fc14efda1f5e98b1b3dc6b131bde20f03d105f4)

The spike around 6k trophies is pretty close to as big as the ladder is now, and it doesn't curb off as sharply past 6000 trophies.  This change seems like it would help, but it does very little and takes away the usefulness of upgrades for players.  It also means that in scenarios where levels were capped, having a 1 king tower disadvantage is an 8 level difference, which puts a player at a 2/3 - 1/3 chance of winning against them.  That is hugely unfair.

Lastly, there has been some discussion, especially on r/ClashStats about capping levels by [league](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClashStats/comments/qzd0jv/idea_cascading_level_caps_by_league/). I didn't use the exact level caps from their discussion,  I tried capping at lvl 8 until Challenger 2, lvl 9 until challenger 3, lvl 10 until Master 1 and so on.

[Level difference\/match vs Trophies](https://preview.redd.it/1h0so1b88ka81.png?width=586&format=png&auto=webp&s=101ef6d197550067c4afcd61c4f2f848b811184b)

There is still the spike at 6k, but it is lowered from the current ladder.  This would work in practice moderately well. There would be no level 14 cards at 5k.  However, the major drawback is that players may lose the incentive to level up cards since there is no reason to get beyond level 8 if you can get to the highest arena.  This also means the only players that can use lvl 14 cards are 7k players and that makes up a *very* small percent of players. (Top 10k was \~7070 last season).

This model also allows for a better distribution of players on the ladder.  Before, there was huge number of players stuck at \~5800.  This model alleviates the log jam by letting more players continue on.  There are more players near 6500 but it still dwindles as we approack 7k.

&#x200B;

**Larger Scale Tests**

Next, lets look at models that *will not* work sustainably.  For these few tests, I ran them on a much larger scale of 100000 players.  I also added 2 parameters:  Skill and Party Percent.  The reason the other models weren't tested on this is because I used 4x the players and ran it through 5 seasons at the minimum, which takes 80 million battles

Skill represents the skill of a player.  When 2 players have : equal levels, then I use this eqn to find out who wins a match: Chance of more skilled player winning = 0.5 \* skill difference/2.5

Party percent represents the chance that a player plays party mode instead of ladder.  If a player's party pct is 0.3, there is a 30% chance that the player isn't added to the queue when picked randomly.

Strict card level matchmaking with a difference of 8 levels. 1v1 showdown uses card level matchmaking, so if SC wanted to implement this quickly, they would use the same mm algorithm as party mode.  In my matches, I almost always match with someone between 8 card levels of me, so I decided to test it with an 8 level difference.

[Trophy distribution with card levels shown by color. ](https://preview.redd.it/g5u7bni11ka81.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=3195513b4efec077a4dece3118f117caead684a9)

I capped card level matchmaking at 6k here.  I was quite surprised to not see the spike like we see in the current ladder.  As expected, there are player with a total card level of 60 reaching 6k, which is far lower than should be required to reach 6k.

[Level difference vs Trophies](https://preview.redd.it/jplshg422ka81.png?width=586&format=png&auto=webp&s=36d85e7a4b0b4f770d128897a3e754a2467e5c9e)

The matches are more unfair at the 5000 trophy mark, but are closer around 6k.

[Histogram of trophies with King Tower illustrated](https://preview.redd.it/r01smu422ka81.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=871d6f9f5bc4670e21d9ce7159ca4cd4df2f0f3a)

This is what I see as the drawback to this model .  There are a significant about of level 11 accounts that are passing 6500 trophies, which isn't not necessarily a good thing.  There are also level 13 accounts that are stuck below 6k, which isn't necessarily a good thing.

The next one was a suggestion I heard from CWA in march 2021 and ocassionally on the sub: King tower matchmaking but restrict it to equal king towers.

&#x200B;

[Trophy distribution with equal king tower opponents](https://preview.redd.it/ht4cll003ka81.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a6974a836f5d2adac004f25c9a712c2fcc1d922)

There are low level players at the top of the leaderboards.  The #1 player is at 7877 trophies, which is below the normal top of the leaderboard number (Typically \~8200).  The player is a level 11 with a skill attribute 3.49 standard deviations above average. A skilled level 11 should not be able to reach the top of the leaderboard.

# Conclusion

The most equitable and fair ladder is the one with level caps by league:

&#x200B;

|League|Maximum Card Level|
|:-|:-|
|Challenger 1|64|
|Challenger 2|72|
|Challenger 3|80|
|Master 1|88|
|Master 2|96|
|Master 3|104|
|Champion and Above|112|

For this model, I ran it through 13 seasons.  What I found was remarkable: The card level difference was low across most trophy ranges with a few outliers.

[Level Difference\/match vs Trophies](https://preview.redd.it/qrolv79hdka81.png?width=586&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1f4254f145c29fd3627d2722606499c3ef6a554)

Another thng that this model is meant to fix is that players who are highly skilled are penalized with massive card level disadvantages.

[Level Difference\/Match vs Skill](https://preview.redd.it/nxn3adm9jka81.png?width=586&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa18446b1febc3efa4acde242499d044f11c128b)

This model eliminates much of it.  There are some level 8's that experience some larger level differences, but these are significantly in the minority.  The level difference does go up as players are more skilled, but a difference of 4 card levels isn't the end of the world, especially since one card can't be overlevelled by 4 levels.

We can also look at the skill level at each trophy range.

[Skill Level vs Trophies](https://preview.redd.it/il76t95vjka81.png?width=586&format=png&auto=webp&s=29093412d609d60f67fd7a87c67a060b4d9ddf6b)

The skill level goes up as the torphies increase, as expected.  There are a couple outliers of high skill and low trophies and it ends up being due to levels. As players go further in trophies, the matches get more fair *and* the spike at 6k goes away, which eliminates the log jam where players get stuck.

Of all the models I tried, this one was the best, although capping lvls by league starting at level 11 at Challenger 1 also works, but not quite as well.  If this idea was to be implemented by SC, I suspect that they would have it capped at level 11 so that more players can use their level 14 cards.

Testing these models with KT mm revealed a couple interesting things:

* In a lot of cases, the average card level difference did decrease
* When the KT mm is cut out (6000 currently), there is a spike in players around the cutoff
* Whenever KT is involved in MM, there are always players with high king towers left behind.
* Players with low king towers could climb higher than players with higher kings would with equal card levels.

Because of the spike in player count and players with low kings pushing up higher, I decided to not have king tower mm in my finalized model.  It would make queue times faster and incentivize players to level up their king tower.  Since levels are capped, the avg card level difference per match is already low, and is mostly attributed to king tower differences, which are necessary to keep level 14 players at the top of the leaderboards.

________________

Hi, u/BanterBoat here, and after my temporary leave during the knockout stages of the tournament, I'm here to finish off with the 2018 World Cup Final. This competition has been a pleasure for the eyes and the heart, and hopefully this final will be just as exciting. France are the favorites in this match, but we're no strangers to upsets...

Before we go on any further, I just want to thank the mods and my fellow match threaders for the great time I've had. It's been a privilege to experience this World Cup with them and all of you r/soccer users, old or new.

And lastly, let's have a quick moment of silence for all the faded flairs. Though no one wants to be faded, one of these teams will join us. Only one can win the World Cup.

* The Madrid's slim hopes of snatching the title from Barcelona on the last day ultimately came to naught as Luis Suárez led the Catalans to a comfortable win at Granada. Madrid did what they could, and Cristiano Ronaldo's early goal meant that for 15 minutes Zidane's men even topped the provisional table. Ronaldo hit a second soon after – his 35th in the league this term – but Madrid were destined to finish runners-up by a point.

* Atlético, already fated to come third, ended their domestic campaign with a routine victory. Fernando Torres opened the scoring following a fiery, if goalless, opening 45 minutes at the Estadio Vicente Calderón. Antoine Griezmann then overtook Radamel Falcao as the club's top marksman of the Simeone era, with his 44th strike in that frame. The clean sheet meant ever-present Jan Oblak conceded just 18 in the Liga season, equalling Francisco Liaño's Spanish top-flight record.

**1'** - [](#icon-whistle-big) The whistle blows and this historic match is underway thanks to Atleti!

**2'** - Atletico mount the first raid down the right side, but Juanfran can't cross and Real start to play out from the back—Marcelo almost gifts the ball to Torres, but Pepe is alert to hoof clear.

**6'** - [**VITAL SAVE BY OBLAK!**](https://streamable.com/v6tf) Bale takes a free-kick from the edge of the box and Casemiro gets on the end of the Welshman's ball but Oblak saves!

**8'** - Real Madrid are very much on the ascendency as we approach the 10-minute mark, and they have everyone queuing up in possession, looking to get their share of time on the ball. That's the sign of a confident team, when everyone looks to get involved.

**10'** - [](#sprite1-p9) [](#icon-yellow-big) The first card of the game is shown to **Dani Carvajal** for a poor slide-tackle on Griezmann.

**15'** - [](#sprite1-p9) [](#icon-ball-big) [**GOOOOOL! Sergio Ramos!**](https://streamable.com/hkzz) Just look at what it means to the Real Madrid skipper! Kroos' free-kick is flicked on by Bale, where Ramos arrives inside the six-yard box to meet in and slot a finish through the legs of Oblak! He runs off celebrating as the Atletico defence is breached - a rarity for them in the competition! **(1-0)**

**17'** - Atleti are very accomplished in erasing a deficit, and their resolve will be put to the greatest test of them all now. The team who scored first in the rematch of this final two years ago went on to lose the match, so there's absolutely no reason for Simeone's side to panic.

**19'** - Atletico are very accomplished in erasing a deficit, and their resolve will be put to the greatest test of them all now. The team who scored first in the rematch of this final two years ago went on to lose the match, so there's absolutely no reason for Simeone's side to panic.

**22** - Ronaldo surges forward and shoots from 25 yards, but it's straight at Savic with two players in space either side of him. The No. 7 hasn't been much involved yet, but his side are ahead.

**24'** - Filipe Luis does well down the left and crosses from deep, but as the ball breaks to Juanfran, he skies his effort well over the bar.

**27'** - Ronaldo's cross doesn't cause much of a problem for Oblak after the forward roams out to the right side. Atletico try to fashion a chance down the left again themselves, but Ramos and Pepe have been solid aerially so far.

**30'** - Filipe finds the run of Griezmann which yields a corner. Real clear the initial danger, then Koke swings a dangerous ball in toward the far post—but it's slightly overhit and Keylor sees it out.

**31'** - Casemiro wins the ball and surges forward, teeing up Benzema who shows tremendous skill to beat Godin—but Oblak provides a fine one-handed stop to cut out the low cross.

**34'** - Griezmann curls in a shot from 20 yards which Keylor has to readjust to save, but it's comfortable in the end. Gabi then flicks a pass over the defence to Griezmann who batters a shot in—it's saved, but he's offside anyway.

**38'** - Atletico certainly holding plenty more of the ball in the last 10 minutes or so, but not too many clear chances as a result of it yet. Griezmann turns and shoots again, but he's a good 30 yards from goal this time and it's easy for Keylor to save.

**41'** - Gabi threads a pass to Griezmann again and it's the No. 7 who continues to be Atleti's danger man. This time the effort comes on his right foot, and he drags the shot wide of goal. Atleti with 62% possession in the last 15 minutes

**44'** - Final minute of the half. Bale tries to surge forward but Savic sees him off. Atletico's longer pass toward the box is cleared by Modric and Ramos—Atletico not getting bodies in the box despite this possession.

**Halftime** - Madrid 1-0 Atleti

**46'** - [](#icon-whistle-big) The second half is started by Real Madrid who are looking to keep their lead.

**46'** - [](#sprite1-p76) [](#icon-sub-big) Atleti make the first change of the night as [](#icon-down-big) **Augusto Fernández** goes off for [](#icon-up-big) **Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco**.

**47'** - [**PENALTY FOR ATLETI!**](https://streamable.com/cs2c) Torres has been invisible thus far, but in the blink of an eye, he makes all the difference!

**47'** - [](#sprite1-p9) [](#icon-yellow-big) **Keylor Navas** is booked for what appears to be dissent.

**48'** - [**PENALTY MISSED!**](https://streamable.com/strt) Griezmann cannons his penalty off the underside of the bar and it stays out! Real Madrid have been handed a lifeline, as Atletico still have it all to do now!

**52'** - [](#sprite1-p9) [](#icon-sub-big) Madrid make their first change of the night at [](#icon-down-big) **Dani Carvajal** limps off for [](#icon-up-big) **Danilo**.

**54'** - Godin wins a header off a corner, Griezmann flicks it goalward and Savic stabs the ball a yard wide from close range. They just cannot get the ball over the line, but they are certainly on top here.

**57'** - Bale again wins a near-post header and flicks it on, but Casemiro is grappling in the box as the second ball comes over and the chance is gone. Carrasco has had a good impact already, darting off the left flank, but his cross now is cleared by Pepe and Koke half-volleys just wide of the near post.

**59'** - Atletico go close again as we reach the hour mark, but Saul's late untracked run into the box ends with him striking wide from 15 yards.

**60'** - [](#sprite1-p76) [](#icon-yellow-big) **Fernando Torres** is booked for kicking Sergio Ramos.

**63'** - Atletico dominant in terms of possession, but Real have all 11 in their own defensive third. They aren't giving up space easily at this point and Saul has to flash a shot wide from 25 yards again.

**65'** - Savic supermanning that ho to clear the danger.

**67'** - Bale lines up a free-kick after Ronaldo is fouled by Godin, but it's deflected over the bar and away for a corner. Kroos delivers...but Atletico clear and there was a foul in the box in any case.

**70'** - Ronaldo dribbles through two weak challenges and Godin has to come across to cover on the challenge. At the other end Atletico seem to have lost all momentum and movement—they went so close to a goal a couple of times, but since then have fallen flat.

**71'** - Great break down the right by Benzema and he goes one on one with the keeper, but Oblak stays huge and makes a fine block. Very important stop to keep Atletico in the game.

**72'** - [](#sprite1-p9) [](#icon-sub-big) [](#icon-down-big) **Toni Kroos** is done for the night and [](#icon-up-big) **Isco** comes on to replace him.

**74'** - [**Pepe is at it again!**](https://streamable.com/4p4o) The defender is issued a warning by Clattenburg for a laughable display of poor sportsmanship as he winces and embellishes on the ground after Luis offered him an apologetic hand following a foul. Pepe acts as if he's been slapped in the face and the referee is having none of it.

**77'** - [](#sprite1-p9) [](#icon-sub-big) Madrid make their final change as [](#icon-down-big) **Benzema** goes off for [](#icon-up-big) Lucas Vázquez.

**78'** - As figures to be the case, Real Madrid are going to get the opportunities over the final 10 minutes on the counter, with Atletico forced to send bodies forward. Ronaldo is teed up for a shot from atop the area, but bounces a rather disappointing effort straight at Oblak.

**79'** - [](#sprite1-p9) [](#icon-yellow-big) **Casemiro** goes into the book for a rough challenge on Carraso.

**79'** - [](#sprite1-p76) [](#icon-ball-big) [**GOOOOOL! Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco!**](https://streamable.com/cmuw) A delicious scoop over the top from Gabi sends Juanfran through, and he picks out an equally sumptuous first-time cross for Carrasco. The Belgian gets in front of Lucas and slots it home from in close! We're back on level terms in Milan as extra-time beckons at the San Siro! **(1-1)**

**82'** - Atletico really on the front foot now. Is this a complete reversal of 2014, where Real equalised late and won it? Ronaldo can't control a long ball and it bounces out of play—he really has struggled tonight.

**83'** - Torres sprints in at the near post to get on the end of another Juanfran cross and gets a shot away—but it's just the wrong side of the post and it remains 1-1.

**86'** - Bale surges off the left and shoots low, but Oblak again is in place to punch behind. From the corner Bale attacks the ball in the air, but heads over—via Pepe.

**87'** - Marcelo does brilliantly down the left to flash a cross over, but it's past everyone without a touch and away from danger.

**90+2'** - This second half has made for some compelling viewing, and it's looking like we're surely going to be given the gift of another 30 minutes now. Both teams are cautiously approaching this stoppage time, not wanting to concede what would be a soul-crushing goal in the dying embers.

**90+3'** - [](#sprite1-p9) [](#icon-yellow-big) An incredibly cynical foul from **Sergio Ramos** who hacks Carrasco to ground to stop a dangerous looking Atletico attack after being cleanly beaten for pace by the Belgian. He picks up a yellow card, much to the dismay of the Atletico players.

**90+3'** - [](#sprite1-p76) [](#icon-yellow-big) **Gabi** is shown a yellow card of his own for his protests, asking for Ramos to be sent off. He waves his finger in the face of Clattenburg and that was never going to go unpunished.

**End of second half** - Madrid 1-1 Atleti

**91'** - [](#icon-whistle-big) Extra time is started by Real Madrid.

**92'** - Vazquez surges forward but is tackled, then Carrasco beats Danilo and is hauled back—yellow card for the right-back. Carrasco on fire since coming on.

**93'** - [](#sprite1-p9) [](#icon-yellow-big) Yellow card shown to **Danilo** by the referee.

**95'** - Poor from Ronaldo! That was a great chance for the forward to stamp his authority on the match, something he's yet to do. It plays into his strength as he gets on the end of a corner-kick, but times his jump all wrong as he can't test Oblak.

**97'** - Lovely interplay from Atletico in attack, as nearly everyone gets a touch on the ball as they pass their way around this Real side. Tired legs may indeed be starting to creep in, but Atletico aren't the ones showing it - and they have two substitutions left still.

**99'** - Griezmann almost surges through once more but Danilo does get a tackle this time. Atletico working hard to find spaces and keep Real pulled all over the place. Juanfran doing superbly down the right flank too.

**102'** - Plenty of bodies in the way as Atletico have mount some defence against a Real attack. Bale is down and struggling with cramp for a moment—Atleti have two subs left, Real have none.

**104'** - Carrasco gets into overdrive again, leaving Danilo and Vazquez for dead before shooting into a defender. Corner for Atletico....Griezmann overhead-kicks it over the bar.

**End of the first half of extra time** - Madrid 1-1 Atleti

**105'** -  [](#icon-whistle-big) The second half of extra time is started.

**109'** - [](#sprite1-p76) [](#icon-sub-big) [](#icon-down-big) **Filipe Luís** has a cramp and is taken off for **Lucas Hernández**.

**110'** - Gabi wins the ball, dribbles forward and is chopped down by Pepe with a thigh-height kick. Yellow card for the defender.

**111'** - [](#sprite1-p9) [](#icon-yellow-big) **Pepe** finally goes into the referee's book.

**116'** - [](#sprite1-p76) [](#icon-sub-big) [](#icon-down-big) **Koke** is substituted and on comes **Thomas Partey**. 

**119'** - A cleverly worked move from Real, their best of the extra-time, sees Lucas Vazquez teed up inside the area, but he hesitates for a second which allows Lucas Hernandez to get across and block the effort!

**End of extra time** - Madrid 1-1 Atleti

A New Fan's Guide to the NBA 2018-2019 Season,"Almost a year ago to the day, today, I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/71q7j5/brand_new_to_basketball_whats_happening_right_now/) on r/nba explaining that I was a new fan who’d just moved from a non-basketball city (Pittsburgh) to a basketball city (Portland) trying to catch up on the league. I asked for some help understanding the state of the NBA: the storylines, the teams to watch, the players to pay attention to. You guys gave me a ton of amazing, wonderful responses. So this year, after following the league closely, reading NBA books, watching NBA documentaries, and having this sub as my homepage for the past year – I wanted to repay you.

So may I present...

##**A New Fan’s Guide to the NBA 2018-2019 Season.**

I hope this is helpful in assisting any new fans to basketball, or to the NBA, or any fans returning after not paying attention for a few seasons. Enjoy!

#**1. NBA Basketball 101**

**Scoring ‘Baskets’.** Putting the ball through the hoop either awards you 1, 2, or 3 points depending on the circumstance. 2-point shots are the most common, and the default for any shot, lay-up, or dunk. The shot is worth 3-points if it enters the basket from beyond the aptly-named 3-point line, also called ‘the arc’ (e.g. ‘from beyond the arc’ or ‘from downtown’). Common types of standard shots include the ‘jump shot’, when a player’s feet leave the ground as the ball leaves his hands, and the ‘step back’, when a player quickly steps backwards, away from the defender just before shooting. The only 1-point baskets are free throws – open, uncontested shots awarded to players who have been fouled, or whose team has amassed a certain number of fouls in a quarter.

**Fouls & Violations.** The penalties of the NBA come in a wide variety of obscure forms, but the ones you’re going to see the most are:

•	Personal Fouls – When an opposing player hits, pushes, shoves, holds, or illegally obstructs another player. If the fouled player was shooting the ball, and the ball went in, they’re awarded one free throw (i.e. they get 2 points for the basket, or 3 if it was a 3-pointer, and have an opportunity to make it a 3-point or 4-point play, respectively, by scoring a free-throw). If the fouled player was shooting the ball while fouled and missed, they are awarded either 2 free throws for a missed 2-pointer, or 3 free throws for a missed 3-pointer.

•	Charging – You can’t plow into a defending player.

•	Blocking – You can’t plow into an offensive player.

•	Traveling – You can’t move while holding the ball and not dribbling it.

•	Carrying – You can’t hold the ball from underneath between dribbles.

•	Goaltending – Imagine a shot ball as traveling in an arc through the air. Once it reaches the apex of that arc and begins to fall downward toward the basket, it can no longer be blocked, or touched, by any player.

•	3-Second Violation – In general, you cannot stand in the ‘key’ or ‘lane’ – the painted rectangle just under the basket – for more than 3 seconds. There are a variety of exceptions, but in general this prevents a player from standing under the basket for a substantial period of time.

There are others that are less common and less important. Understand that many of these fouls and violations are, to some degree, subjective, and that the referees who determine whether they’ve taken place are imperfect. Mistakes are made. Calls are made that shouldn’t have been, and calls aren’t made that should’ve been. It’s part of the game. Get used to it.

**Assists.** Assists are a stat awarded to players who pass the ball to a player who then promptly scores. This stat reflects a player’s passing ability, their unselfishness, and their ‘vision’ – their ability to know where other players are on the court and to get the ball to them at the right time to guarantee a score. [Here’s a montage of some beautiful assists.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=032N4hay1QY) 

**Rebounds.** Also called ‘boards’, rebounds are when a player grabs a missed shot – often as it falls away from the hoop or backboard. Offensive rebounds are those rebounds secured from the opposing team’s basket, i.e. your team missed a shot, but you’ve retained the ball. Defensive rebounds are those secured from your own team’s basket, i.e. the opposing team missed a shot and you have reclaimed possession for your team.

[Here’s a game from Psychotic Ambassador to North Korea Dennis Rodman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF6qOsgb1cs), whose hands seemed to be magnetically attracted to any ball that fell from the rim any time he was in a game.

**Blocks.** Any time a player attempts a shot, layup, or dunk, and another player interrupts the ball from going into the basket, that is a block. Goaltending fouls generally occur as a result of mistimed blocks. [Here are some of last season’s best blocks.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGVtoBqv4-Q) Blocking is one of two purely defensive stats, along with…

**Steals.** This one’s pretty simple. If you manage to take possession of the ball away from a player on the opposing team, you have recorded a steal. But hey, [let’s montage it anyway.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW9X5h-cFC0)

**Screens.** When one player takes a firm stance on the court and stops players from the opposing team from getting around them, they have ‘set a screen’ or ‘set a pick’. This is often done by offensive players assisting the ballhandler by slowing down and rerouting defenders, allowing their teammates the time and space to score. The ‘pick and roll’ is a common type of 2-player offensive play designed to allow an offensive player to escape defenders via the use of a screen. A ‘switch’ is when defenders must reassign which defensive players are guarding which offensive players often as a result of screens and similar offensive adjustments. Forcing ‘mismatches’ and ‘bad switches’ can be a crucial offensive tactic in generating poor defense and better scoring opportunities. [Here’s a compilation of some ‘brick wall’ screens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcAW6g6BNao), i.e. clips of people setting such firm screens that other players smack off of them like they’re a wall.

**Cutting/Driving/Finishing.** This is the term for when an offensive player runs toward the basket to attempt a dunk or lay-up. It is often preceded by a screen or by fancy dribbling (like ‘a crossover’) intended to disrupt the defender’s ability to run alongside them. Here, [watch Kyrie put on a driving showcase.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOiyFW1Vcs0)

**Posting Up.** Playing in ‘the post’ is when an offensive player is between the 3-point line and the basket, often nearer the basket or in ‘the paint’, with their back or shoulder facing the basket and a defender pressed against them. This was a very common circumstance in the NBA for a long time, but as the value of shots taken from this middle area has decreased in the current strategic ‘meta’, ‘posting up’ is considered less valuable than either driving to the basket directly for a lay-up or dunk, or passing to the arc for a more valuable 3-point attempt. [The best highlight reel for post play I could find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcULJMJFuNs) is from 2014. See what I mean?

***

#**2. Positions & Player Types**

There are five standard positions in most basketball: the Point Guard and Shooting Guard, the Small Forward and the Power Forward, and the Center. The two Guards are generally the smallest players on the floor and the best at shooting from range. The two Forwards are generally larger and better at playing nearer to the basket. The Center is generally the largest player on the team and assigned to work very close to the basket. In the modern NBA, these positions are becoming increasingly obsolete as more players fill liminal, hybrid roles.

**Point Guard – The De-Facto On-Court Leader**

The ‘floor general’, on most teams, the Point Guard starts each offensive possession with the ball, making the first pass or the first shot. They are often referred to as ‘primary ballhandlers’ for their job in controlling the ball at the start of a play. For a Point Guard, their intelligence, ability to read a defense, and their leadership are as important as their tangible, physical skills, and many of the best PGs are renowned as much for their ‘basketball IQ’ as they are for their jump shots or driving ability.

Stephen Curry and Kyrie Irving fill fairly traditional PG roles for the Warriors and Celtics, respectively. Notice how nearly every possession for each team begins with Steph or Kyrie scoping out the defense, directing their teammates, and initiating a play.

**Shooting Guard – The Flashy Shooter and Driver**

A role that increasingly steps on the toes of the Point Guard and the Small Forward, the Shooting Guard is traditionally a sharpshooter and an independent playmaker – a player who roams the 3-point line waiting for a chance at a 3-point shot, or hoping to be defended in isolation (‘iso ball’ is the name for 1-on-1 play) where they often excel at drop-stepping or cross-overs to push away the defender for an open shot, or to beat them to a drive to the basket.

Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant were both archetypal SGs, tremendous long-range shooters who also had the skill to blow by defenders and drive to the rim. In today’s game, James Harden exemplifies the Shooting Guard role.

**Small Forward – The All-Around Problem-Solver**

The ‘middle’ role on the court, between the two Guards and the Power Forward and Center, the Small Forward is a role often assigned to players of general, all-around skill and athleticism, jacks of all trades who are not big and powerful enough to take on around-the-rim roles, but who aren’t small and agile enough to be Guards. Small Forwards should ideally be capable of performing essentially every role on the court as-needed, and depending on the team, the coach, and the play, can fulfill a wide range of functions.

Unsurprisingly, the two players widely-regarded as the best in the NBA today – LeBron James and Kevin Durant – are both Small Forwards, as they are each capable of doing just about anything – shooting 3’s, driving to the basket, setting screens, defending, and everything in-between.

**Power Forward & Center – The Rim-Protector and Two-Hand Dunker**

These two positions have gravitated together to such a degree that distinguishing between them is, in my opinion, not valuable. Often when sports journalists discuss the best Power Forwards or best Centers in the NBA, they stumble over the comparisons, being unsure exactly who should be counted as which position. Power Forwards and Centers are the biggest players on the court (the two positions, combined, are referred to as ‘Bigs’), and as such, are generally the most talented rebounders and shot blockers by sheer virtue of their strength and height. Traditionally, PFs played slightly farther away from the basket than true Centers, playing in the post and taking mid-range shots. As this type of play vanishes in the NBA, their role has become all-but identical to that of the Center.

Great historical Centers include Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain, and Bill Russell (once upon a time, the Center was more like today’s Point Guard in serving as the de-facto team leader) as well as Shaquille O’Neal, who is perhaps to this day the most archetypal Center of all time. Great Power Forwards include Tim Duncan and Dirk Nowitzki – both of whom were capable of playing at greater range than most Centers are. In today’s game, great Bigs include Anthony Davis and Joel Embiid.

#**3. A Brief History of the NBA**

**1946-1959: The Early League**

The Basketball Association of America was founded in 1946 by a bunch of dudes who owned hockey arenas when they realized that basketball teams could make them some cash when their arenas were sitting around empty. The BAA absorbed two other leagues – the ABL and the NBL – by 1950, when it became the NBA. The game was substantially different back then – there was no 3-point line or shot-clock (explained later in the next paragraph) – and things like player training, nutrition, travel, and salary were basically non-existent. Stories abound about players who drank and smoked excessively, who had to hitchhike to games in rural places like Fort Wayne and Rochester where teams were located, and retiring because they got jobs that paid them too much to justify playing (can you imagine that happening today?).

The first non-white player, Wataru Misaka, played in 1947, and the first black players joined the league in 1950. The shot-clock was introduced in 1954 (the shot-clock can be seen ticking down in the corner of the screen during any NBA game – it allows the offensive team only 24 seconds to attempt a shot, which resets if the ball touches the rim – preventing one team from simply holding onto the ball the entire game, which is exactly what some teams were doing in the early 50’s, famously once resulting in a final score of 19-18).

The Minneapolis Lakers (now Los Angeles) won five titles in ’49, ’50, ’52, ’53, and ’54 under legendary coach John Kundla and headlined by the first basketball star in history, George Mikan, nicknamed “Mr. Basketball”.

**1960-1969: Russell’s Celtics Dynasty**

Bill Russell, the winningest American sportsman in history, joined the Boston Celtics and their star guard Bob Cousy and soon-to-be-legendary coach Red Auerbach in 1957. Between 1957 and 1969, the Celtics would win the NBA Championship a staggering 11 of 13 times, including 8 straight from ’59 through ’66. The NBA has never seen anything like it again, and likely never will. Bill Russell was a defensive monster (in an era before most defensive stats were tracked) and selflessly devoted to winning above all else. Russell was not just the star of the team, but also the coach for the ’68 and ’69 championships as well. Player-coaches are not something we’re going to see again, but Russell got two titles doing both jobs.

During the Celtics’ reign, they would beat Elgin Baylor and Jerry West’s Lakers in ’62, and ’63, Wilt Chamberlain’s Warriors in ’64, then Baylor and West’s Lakers again in ’65, ’66, and ’68. Wilt teamed up with Baylor and West for the ’69 finals, during which West averaged over 37-points per game against the Celtics, now led by a 35-year old player-coach Bill Russell.

And the Celtics still won. Bill Russel’s Celtics were incredible. In any other era, Baylor and West would’ve won several titles (Wilt is less certain: he seemed to care a lot more about his stats, which were admittedly absolutely preposterous, including a 100-point game, than winning).

**1970-1979: The ABA and Over-Expansion**

Understanding the NBA in the 1970’s can be a little difficult. There was a lot going on. During the early-to-mid ‘70s, the ABA gave the NBA a run for its money by offering a more exciting, fast-paced, player-centric game with a multi-colored ball, a 3-point line, a dunk contest, and flashy players with cool nicknames like Julius “Dr. J” Erving. Meanwhile, the NBA went from 9 teams in 1966 to 18 teams in 1974 and was thoroughly diluted with talent. The 70’s are largely remembered as an era when basketball was not especially popular, strangled by racism both internally and by the potential audience, with TV networks offering very little to the league that was increasingly known for losing out to sitcom reruns and hit by multiple drug scandals (NBA players were just famous enough to have as much cocaine as they wanted, but not quite famous enough to get away with it).

The great players of the 1970’s besides Dr. J (who would eventually join the NBA when the ABA merged into it by the end of the decade) include Kareem Abdul-Jabaar (statistically one of the three greatest players of all time), Rick Barry (who shot his free-throws grandma-style, underhanded), Elvin Hayes, Knicks hero Walt ‘Clyde’ Frazier, 3x MVP Moses Malone, George ‘The Iceman’ Gervin, and ‘Pistol’ Pete Maravich (who was born a few minutes away from where I was born, and my name is also Pete – please clap).
The 70’s are the only decade in NBA history where we really can’t talk about anything resembling a dynasty. The talent was so dispersed by the rapid expansion that no team even managed to win back-to-back titles the entire decade, and only the Knicks (’70 and ’73) and Celtics (’74 and ’76) won 2.

Then, in 1979, the 3-point line was added to the NBA the same year that two rookies joined the league – a scrawny white farm boy named Larry Bird joined the Boston Celtics, and a charismatic, wide-smiling showman joined the Lakers. His name was Earvin Johnson – but everyone called him Magic.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tMmaXRSeL4

**1980-1990: The Bird-Magic Rivalry**

If it weren’t for Larry Bird, Magic’s Lakers would’ve dominated the 80’s like the Minneapolis Lakers dominated the 50’s. If it weren’t for Magic Johnson, Bird’s Celtics would’ve done to this decade what Russell’s had done to the 60’s. Luckily for all of us, instead of domination, the 80’s were fierce competition – and that competition sparked a huge upturn in broadcast numbers and ticket sales. These two players, who had played against each other in the ’79 NCAA College Championship Game, would, through their rivalry (first a genuine spite, and later a genuine friendship), reinvigorate a shoddy league and set the stage for the modern NBA. From here on, from Magic and Bird on, the NBA is the league as we know it today – superteams, corporate sponsorships, 3-pointers, flashy dunks – the NBA we know and love was born between Magic and Bird.

The Lakers, with young superstar Magic and veteran leader Kareem, won the ’80, ’82, ’85, ’87, and ’88 championships under legendary coach Pat Riley. The Celtics won the ’81, 84, and ’86 titles, with Bird leading a remarkable team of the likes of Kevin McHale and Robert Parish. During the battle between these two juggernauts (three of those NBA finals were Celtics-Lakers), Moses Malone got to three championship series – one loss with the 76ers, one win with the 76ers, and one more loss with the Rockets – and Hakeem Olajuwon’s Rockets, a team that would’ve been amazing in any other era, got to, and lost, one finals series against Boston. With these exceptions, the ’80 to ’87 era was dominated by Boston and Los Angeles.

In ’88, Magic’s Lakers won their last title against Isiah Thomas’ Bad Boy Pistons – who would go on to beat them in ’89 and then beat the Portland Trail Blazers and Clyde Drexler in ’90. The Pistons three straight finals and two straight titles are something of a forgotten bridge between the famous Bird-Magic ‘80s and the even more famous era that was to follow…

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkySfD_uZbY

**1991-1998: Michael Jordan**

Drafted into the league from the University of North Carolina in 1984, Michael Jordan grew up while Bird and Magic were still sharing the crown, on a Bulls team that just wasn’t quite up to snuff. But as Magic and Bird aged and the Lakers and Celtics faded, and Isiah Thomas’ Pistons took the crown, the Bulls and their now-prime Michael Jordan were ready. Under the leadership of coach Phil Jackson, the Bulls ousted the Pistons to face Magic in his last finals appearance in 1991, and won in 5 games. The next year, Michael’s Bulls beat Portland. The year after that, they beat the Suns. Michael Jordan was the greatest player the league had seen in decades, maybe ever… and at the height of all that, after three straight titles… his father was murdered, and he was faced with a personal crisis that culminated in his retirement from the NBA to play for a minor-league baseball team (If it sounds like there has to be a larger story there – there is, but we don’t have time to get into that here).

While Michael was gone, Hakeem Olajuwon’s Rockets (remember them from the 80’s?) came back to win back-to-back titles in ’94 and ’95. Hakeem caught a break… or so he thought.

“I’m back.”

With those two words, Jordan came out of retirement, and immediately led the Bulls to a regular-seasons record of 72-10, the best in history to that point, followed by another threepeat, winning the ’96 title over Seattle, and the ’97 and ’98 titles over Karl ‘The Mailman’ Malone and John Stockton’s Utah Jazz. Two threepeats, 6 titles, an undefeated record in the finals, and now, at last… Jordan would retire again, this time for good.

…wait, he came back AGAIN? And played for a terrible team that missed the playoffs? Okay, we’re going to pretend that didn’t happen. Jordan retired for good as far as anyone is concerned. And so in 1999, after years of the leadership of epic players like Bird, Magic, Thomas, Olajuwon, and Jordan, the league was opened up for new blood.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAr6oAKieHk

**1999-2010: NBA in the New Millennium**

From ’99 through ’10, coach Gregg Popovich’s San Antonio Spurs won 4 titles, and coach Phil Jackson’s (remember him?) Lakers won 5 titles. That probably makes it sound like this was another of the NBA’s great rivalries, but it really wasn’t – at least, not in the same way as the Lakers-Celtics, for example. The Spurs and Lakers are both in the Western Conference, meaning that the two teams could never play against one another in the finals. Popovich’s Spurs were championed by legendary Power Forward Tim Duncan, while Jackson’s Lakers road the wave of incomparably dominant Center Shaq, and devastating Shooting Guard Kobe Bryant. Besides the hiccup of the ’04 Pistons, the ’06 Heat (coached by Pat Riley – remember him, too?), and the ’08 Celtics, the Spurs and the Lakers dominated this decade.

I imagine many of the people looking to get into the NBA grew up with the ’99-’10 NBA happening in the background. It might stand out as odd to you that the Shaq-Kobe Lakers duo was such a cultural phenomenon even outside of the basketball world, while Tim Duncans Spurs seemed to slip under the radar. The Spurs played a very clean, unselfish, systematic style of basketball, and Tim Duncan had the exact opposite of a superstar personality, creating a very professional and undramatic dynasty compared to those led by spotlight-lit stars like Kobe or Shaq – or even Allen Iverson, who I distinctly remember as a non-basketball-fan growing up, even though his team never managed to win a finals (they made it, but lost, in ’01).

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juBiQUjwx7c

**2011-2016: LeBron James**

Best to just come out with it from the very start. LeBron James has been in every NBA Finals game since 2011. His Miami Heat made the Finals every year from ’11 – ’14, and when he returned to his hometown of Cleveland, his Cavaliers made the finals every year from ’15 – ’18. Were the Heat in the Finals the year before LeBron arrived? Nope. Were the Cavaliers in the Finals the year before LeBron arrived? They weren’t even in the playoffs. LeBron James is a phenomenon.

LeBron, a son of Akron, Ohio, not far from Cleveland, was drafted by his hometown Cavaliers straight out of high school in 2003. Though he managed to drag them to one Finals in ’07, Popovich and Duncan’s Spurs swept them 4-0, and by 2010, it became clear that LeBron’s talents were being wasted in Cleveland. Most NBA fans wanted him to stay there, to be loyal to his home team, and to hold out through some bad years and help them see a championship. But in what was dubbed ‘The Decision’, he chose to leave and join superstars Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh on the Miami Heat. The very next season, he made it to the Finals.

The year, 2011, they lost to Dirk Nowitzki (a Power Forward who can shoot 3-pointers, a unique and remarkable player) and the Dallas Mavericks, before winning the ’12 and ’13 titles against the Oklahoma City Thunder (spearheaded by an incredible trio of Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook) and Popovich’s eternal Spurs, who proceeded to best them in ’14.

Remember Jordan’s “I’m Back”? In 2014, LeBron announced he was returning to Cleveland. The team had developed while he was away. They acquired Kyrie Irving, Tristan Thompson, and Kevin Love, and were ready for the King’s guidance. His first year back, they made the finals, and like his first year in Miami, they lost – this time to the Golden State Warriors, led by Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, perhaps the two single greatest shooters in the history of the NBA, as well as superstar Andre Iguodala and defensive machine Draymond Green.

The next year, 2016, the Cavaliers met the Warriors in the Finals again – this Warriors team having beaten Jordan’s Bull’s record of regular season wins, going 73-9 – and the Cavaliers came back from being down 3-1 in the series to win the title, LeBron hoisting his third Championship trophy, and his first with Cleveland, breaking the city’s half-century-long title drought. That win is one of the most legendary in the history of the NBA, and really, in the history of American sports.
And then something happened.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Vre_nWbPxk

**2016-Present: Golden State Dominance**

The Golden State Warriors had made it to the 2016 titles by beating the Oklahoma City Thunder, who were led by Kevin Durant, widely regarded as the second-best player in the league after LeBron.

And the Warriors signed Durant. This team, already featuring the deadliest pair of shooters in NBA history, the league’s Defensive Player of the Year, having gone to back-to-back titles, having just gone 73-9 in the regular season… signed the league’s second-best player. It shook the entire league. Kevin Durant is the greatest villain in the NBA to this day – nobody else comes close. Many regard this as having destroyed all parity in the league.

In 2017 and 2018, the Warriors and Cavaliers faced off in the Finals two more times – marking the first time the same two teams have played in four straight finals – but this time, the Warriors won 4-1 and 4-0. LeBron, despite seemingly never aging and playing as well as he ever has even into his mid-30’s, despite carrying an increasingly-mediocre Cavaliers team to the Finals year after year… simply couldn’t do anything against a Warriors team with not just Steph Curry and Klay Thompson, with not just Draymond Green, but with Kevin Durant as well. Even the Houston Rockets, who in the 2017-2018 season built and designed themselves specifically to defeat the Warriors, whose whole philosophy and strategy was designed around killing the Warriors, who ended this season with a better record and home court advantage over the Warriors, fell in Game 7 of the Western Conference Finals against them.

The Warriors sit on top of the whole league right now in a way that no team has in a very long time. It’s hard to imagine who could beat them.
This offseason, LeBron finally left Cleveland for the second time to join the Los Angeles Lakers. They’re a very young and untested team mixed in with some veteran talent. The Rockets got a little bit worse. The team that would’ve won in the East last year, if not for LeBron, the Celtics, got a little bit better. And what did the Warriors do? The Warriors signed a played named DeMarcus ‘Boogie’ Cousins, one of the most dominant Bigs in the NBA today. He’s coming off a devastating injury and it’s unclear when he’ll be able to play, and whether he’ll be his old self, but there is no indication whatsoever that the Warriors have gotten anything but even better than before. Can anyone possibly threaten them?

Everyone outside of the Bay Area is hoping so. But none of us are feeling very confident about it.

So that’s where we are now.

#**4. Team-by-Team Breakdowns**

I’m going to provide brief summaries of each team in the NBA. These are intended to provide you with the bare basics necessary to have some idea of who they are – what kind of history they’ve had, what their last few seasons have been like, what the expectations are for this season, what we’ll all be watching for, and what particularly notable players have been, or currently are, on their rosters. Stuff will be left out. Important things will be forgotten. People in the comments will be telling me how I left out incredibly vital things that are essential to understanding their favorite team. I know. These are meant to be a primer for new fans, just to get your footing in understanding where a team is coming from and where they're going. I recommend the team's wikipedia pages to learn more.

***

**Atlanta Hawks**

**Hallmarks:** Bob Petit in the ‘50s and ‘60s, Dominique Wilkins in the ’80s and ‘90s; ’58 Champions

**This Year:** Bottom 10

One of the oldest teams in the league, dating back to the Buffalo Bisons in 1946, they won their only NBA Championship in 1958 and haven’t made it back to the finals since ’61, which was before they moved to Atlanta. They have sparsely even managed to make it to the playoffs since then – every time they get the ball rolling and make a playoff break, something seems to fall apart. Dominique Wilkins was one of the great, fun-to-watch dunkers of the ‘80s and his statue sits outside of their arena today. The Hawks had some good fortunes in the late 90’s, and again between ’08 and ’10, but never quite enough to propel them to another Finals. In 2015, finally, it looked like their luck was turning around, having a 17-0 month in January, and even advancing to the Eastern Conference Finals… where LeBron was waiting for them. In 2016, they lost in the first round of the playoffs, and in 2017, they slipped back substantially, as seems to be their curse. They drafted Luka Doncic with the third overall pick in this year’s draft, who they traded for a 2019 first-round pick to the Mavericks for Trae Young. The way that whole thing played out was… controversial.

This year, keep an eye out for Trae Young, who should at the very least be exciting to watch. 41-year old Vince Carter might well be in his final season on their bench. It’s very unlikely that the Hawks will find a lot of success this year, but even if Young and their youthful roster show signs of promise, it will be all the success the Hawks could really hope for. At least the expectations are low. 

***

**Boston Celtics**

**Hallmarks:** 17 NBA Championships, from ’57 through ’08; Bill Russell and Larry Bird.

**This Year:** ECF Contenders

The Boston Celtics are the most successful team in NBA history. They have won 23.9% of all NBA championships in history, and their leaders have won 10 MVPs. Since 1986, they have only managed to win one Championship, the 2008 title. The Celtics have made it to the last four straight playoffs – losing in the first round on ’15 and ’16, and losing in the Eastern Conference Finals to LeBron’s Cavaliers back-to-back in ’17 and ’18. Many commentators speculate that if their last season hadn’t been weakened by injuries to stars Gordon Hayward and superstar Point Guard Kyrie Irving, the Celtics could’ve beaten LeBron and gone to the Finals last year. This year, LeBron has moved to the West, and under the guidance of their incredibly talented coach Brad Stevens and assuming healthy years for their stars and continued growth for their young stars Tatum and Brown, the Celtics have the clearest path to the Finals of any team in the East.

This year, watch the Celtics as closely as any other team. If they stay healthy, the combined power of their all-star lineup, their incredibly deep bench, their all-NBA coach, and the weakened Eastern Conference should make them the clear favorites to face off against Golden State in the Finals. Whether they could beat them is an entirely different question.

***

**Brooklyn Nets**

**Hallmarks:** ABA Champions ’74, ’76, Eastern Conference Title ’02, ’03. Jason Kidd & Dr. J.

**This Year:** Bottom 10

Formerly of New Jersey, the Nets were an ABA team that merged in 1976, bringing Julius Erving into the NBA as the reigning ABA Champs. Though the Nets had a strong streak in the early 00’s under the guidance of Jason Kidd, they never managed to secure an NBA title. Currently in a rebuilding process, they’ve let go of briefly-superstar Jeremy Lin and picked up the likes of Shabazz Napier and Ed Davis from the Blazers on short contracts. It’s been rough going for the Nets, who foolishly gave away their own first-rounders for three straight years, and at last, now, the light might be beginning to peak over the horizon. They have a lot of money in their pockets (and will have even more after this season), and their Brooklyn home attracts superstars far more than a team of their stature normally could. Finally under strong, smart leadership, though the Nets are very unlikely to see any success this year, everything is set up for them to come into next season looking dramatically better.

This year, just enjoy watching some of their young players and one-year contracts, hope for some fun games, and desperately try to make yourselves look like the kind of team that a superstar will want to come to next season.

***

**Charlotte Hornets**

**Hallmarks:** Alonzo Mourning in the early 90’s

**This Year:** Middle-of-the-Pack

The Charlotte Hornets joined as an expansion team in 1988, then moved to New Orleans and became the New Orleans Hornets. Then in 2004, another expansion team started in Charlotte – the Bobcats – until the New Orleans Hornets renamed themselves the Pelicans in 2013, after which the Charlotte Bobcats became the Charlotte Hornets again.
Did you catch all that?

TL;DR the Charlotte Hornets organization as we know it today has only existed since 2004, but they own the rights to the history of the Hornets team from 1988 until 2002 when it moved to New Orleans. So, while the early-90’s Mourning/Johnsons/Curry-era Hornets were a pretty good team… they really have nothing to do with the current Hornets organization. Today’s Hornets, owned by Michael Jordan since 2010, have made three playoffs – each time losing in the first round – and have finished the last two seasons with identical 36-46 records. They are the definition of mediocrity – good enough, maybe, to crack one of the lowest playoff seeds in a year when the conference is weak, but never good enough to do anything with it, and never bad enough to secure a #1 draft pick.

This year, expect much of the same thing. Kemba Walker is talented and entertaining, and this could be his last year in Charlotte. Spurs vet Tony Parker is here to provide guidance and support if things get too dark. You might get to see the first round of the playoffs. Or next year might be the start of a true tanking. It’s all up in the air for the Hornets.

***

**Chicago Bulls**

**Hallmarks:** Michael Jordan and the two 90’s threepeats; the brief spark of light that was Derrick Rose.

**This Year:** Middle-of-the-Pack

The Bulls were a mediocre team until they were the greatest team. Jordan won them their only 6 conference titles and their only 6 championships. Since then, mediocrity has returned to Chicago. Derrick Rose’s ’10-’11 bizzaro-world MVP made it seem like the Bulls might have had another Jordan on their hands, but alas, things are not always as they seem. The Bulls in recent years have been back down toward the bottom of the league, but with rebuilding thoroughly underway and a young and promising roster, it’s not all frowns for the Windy City. LaVine and Markkanen both look very promising (Lauri’s injury was announced as I was typing this – my bad, Chicago), and their draft pick Wendell Carter Jr. is poised to be one of the most exciting rookies to watch this year. It’s not impossible that this is the year the Bulls’ fall comes to a halt and they start turning the plane around and squeeze into the 8th Seed. But it’s also not impossible that the pieces just aren’t in place yet.

This year, watch their young players putting on a fast, exciting show – particularly Wendell Carter Jr., who’s poised to be a Rookie of the Year candidate if anyone is.

***

**Cleveland Cavaliers**

**Hallmarks:** LeBron James, and then again, LeBron James; Incredible 2016 Championship

**This Year:** Middle-of-the-Pack

The Cavaliers joined the league in 1970 and lost the first 15 games they ever played. They made the ECF in 1976, and it was all downhill from there. The Cavaliers were a mediocre-to-bad team (excepting a stint in the '90s under Mark Price and Larry Nance) until they drafted a kid from Akron named LeBron James, and even in his first few years, they struggled. He got them to one Finals in 2007, but it otherwise took him until his 13th season to manage a Championship in Cleveland. It’s hard to win there. It’s always been hard to win there. And now that the King is gone… there’s no reason to think it’s gotten anything but much harder again. Were the Cavaliers really a bad team that just had the greatest player in the world on their roster last year, or do they, now led by Kevin Love, actually have a real team on their hands?

This year, the Cavaliers will be one of the biggest questions, and one of the most-watched and curious teams in the league. For all we know, Love is going to carry the Cavaliers to some amount of success and even crack the playoffs. If the Cavaliers made the 6th Seed, even, I don’t think we’d be shocked. And if they were one of the 5 worst teams in the NBA, we wouldn’t be shocked either. It’s going to be interesting, that’s for sure.

***

**Dallas Mavericks**

**Hallmarks:** Jason Kidd and Steve Nash (neither in their prime), Dirk Nowitzki; 2011 NBA Championship

**This Year:** Bottom 10

The Mavericks joined the NBA in 1980 and had bad luck, drafting quality players like Detlef Schrempf (no, I didn’t just make that name up) and Mark Aguirre only to see them reach their potential once they were no longer on their roster. They drafted Jason Kidd, who had two separate tenures on the team, but who saw his best years – again – while not playing for the Mavs. Their franchise’s true hero is German-born three-point-shooting-Center Dirk Nowitzki, a strange player with a strange life who took the NBA by absolute storm for a few years and won them their sole NBA Title. That 2011 Championship, in comparison to the other titles of the era won by juggernauts GSW, San Antonio, and LeBron, is looking increasingly prestigious and remarkable. This offseason, they traded for #3-but-projected-by-many-#1 draft pick Luka Doncic, who has just come off from winning virtually everything you can win in professional European basketball at the ripe age of 19. In what is likely Dirk’s last year, the team’s hopes rest on his shoulders – but you couldn’t ask for better shoulders to rest your hopes on.

This year, watch Luka. The Mavs are unlikely to see a lot of success – the team just doesn’t have enough talent in enough places – but it’s not an uncommon opinion to project that Luka Doncic is going to do things that very few NBA rookies have ever done before. He has played and succeeded at very high levels of professional basketball, playing with and against adults and veterans. He’s no high schooler or even an NCAA senior. He’s a whole different monster.

"Every time Worlds finals was held in an open stadium, SKT didn't win it. Meanwhile, they are 3/3 in closed venues","Following this trend, SKT should be 2019 Worlds champions, as the finals will be held in AccorHotels Arena in France which is a closed venue.

Riot might as well just give them the trophy already.

Teams I Hate In The Spotlight #1: Liverpool FC,"Welcome back to ‘Teams I Hate in the Spotlight’. A series of posts where football clubs that I proper hate get their well-deserved spot in the limelight.

&nbsp;

This week’s entry is about Liverpool FC, the second club to come from the great city of Liverpool. With a grand total of 300,000,000 /r/soccer and /r/Norway flairs, Liverpool Football club is a self-appointed deity of football with most casual fans expected to applaud and revel in their class and history. Liverpool play their matches in a kit painted Lucifer’s red.

&nbsp;

**History**

&nbsp;

Liverpool Football Club was founded in 1892 due to a rent dispute between then Anfield inhabitants Everton Football Club and landlord John Houlding. In a classic dickhead Kopite move, Mr. Houlding raised the rent by 150% after Everton clinched the title in the 1889-90 season. The then Everton owners committee declared Mr. Houlding a bad bell-end, vacated the stadium and moved to the ever superior Goodison Park while Mr. Houlding looked to found a new club who would inhabit Anfield. Mr. Houlding attempted to name his new venture ‘Everton and Atheltic Grounds Ltd’ in an obvious bid to infringe on the already massively successful and seriously boss Everton FC. When football authorities refused to recognise Houlding’s new ‘Everton’ he renamed the club to ‘Liverpool F.C and Athletic Grounds’ – creating what we now know as Liverpool Football Club. Ipso facto, Liverpool Football Club is the afterbirth of Everton Football Club. Enjoy your second hand stadium you bad bunch of gimps. We were winning league titles on your soil before you were conceived.

&nbsp;

On the playing front, it’s hard to argue against Liverpool’s dominant success domestically and overseas – but I’ll give it a good fucking go.  Bill Shankly was first on the scene to win things for Liverpool in spectacular fashion – completely transforming the club. An outstanding manager who was as quotable as he was successful; Shankly won 3 league titles – one immediately after getting Liverpool promoted from the then second division -  2 FA Cups,  and a UEFA cup amongst other things. Then, in true Liverpool fashion, the club completely cut ties with their heroic talisman under the guise of moving the team forward. ~~Steven Gerrard~~ Bill Shankly, like a man serving a death row sentence, found God. That God was the ever welcoming Everton Football Club:

&nbsp;

*""I have been received more warmly by Everton than I have by Liverpool. It is scandalous that I should have to write these things about the club that I helped build into what it is today.""*
 
- From Bill Shankly's autobiography 'It's More Important Than That' (1976), discussing the period after his retirement.

&nbsp;

Shankly saw the light and walked towards it and all you heathen Liverpool fans out there will also walk this path later on in life - You simply haven’t reached enlightenment yet. Goodison Park is life. Goodison Park is eternal. Shankly died a Blue.

&nbsp;

Success was continued in the form of Bob Paisley’s Liverpool in which the club continued to pick up silverware. From all accounts, Paisley was a great bloke and an even better manager. But, coming from this stranger on the internet, I can tell you he was a massive trophy hoarding cunt. Skipping this era really helps with my agenda.

&nbsp;

Contemporary Liverpool haven’t enjoyed the romping success previous decades have provided and it’s mainly because they’re shit. In 2005 the club reached the Champions League final via a series of fluke results. Against Olympiakos, Steven Gerrard sliced a half-volley in to the far corner which helped qualify the team for the knock-out rounds. In the semi-final, Luis Garcia scored a phantom goal that sunk Chelsea – the ball did not cross the line. Then, in the final, the miracle of Instanbul occurred. The self-described greatest game of all time consisted of Steven Gerrard diving to win a penalty, no winning goal being scored, and the match was decided by an Andriy Shevchenko missed penalty. Millions of Liverpool fans headed out to have ‘5 Times’ branded upon their skin by their local tattoo artist making them not only really individual but also helping other fans identify and avoid them before being pummeled into submission by stories of ‘Stevie G’ and the final without a winning goal.

&nbsp;

The current Liverpool team is much different to what has come to be expected from their disillusioned fans. Their fearless leader is a pedicured David Brent caricature and their team consists of overrated and overvalued footballers. However, this doesn’t stop the fan base from believing they deserve to be at the top of the table via football divinity. With the increasingly hilarity of high profile players turning down the chance to join Liverpool and those they have on the books wanting to leave, the future is bright for all us who hate them. Unfortunately, each time in the past when it has looked like they were about to nose dive in to the abyss, they have rose like The Undertaker from their casket. Another shit summer’s worth of transfers and my Belief Mobile will be accepting passengers.

&nbsp;

**Supporters**

&nbsp;

Becoming a Liverpool fan takes a lot of hard work and dedication. Years of studying ancient mythologies and historical poetry is required so you can compare Brendan Rogers to Ares and write cringeworthy sonnets about distant victories of the past. Being able to create a banner or flag is essential and Latin speakers are desirable. Clothing consists of anything you like as long as you constantly wear a Liverpool scarf and lift it above your head like a tool for every rendition of You’ll Never Walk Alone you hear. Location is not important. If anyone ever questions your bewildering loyalty for the club due to your residence being over 500 miles away from the city of Liverpool simply start to lie. A common and battle-worn excuse is to explain how a family member, who happens to be ‘a massive red’, influenced you from a young age. This tactic has worked handily for decades.

&nbsp;

**Rivalries**

&nbsp;

Geographically, Liverpool’s main rival is Everton Football Club. However, most Liverpool fans don’t feel this way because they don’t live within the city. Liverpool fans have a tendency to class any club that is currently successful as their rivals in a bid to make their team feel relevant and important. During the 90’s, the big rivalry became Liverpool and Manchester United largely due to United’s roaring success. Liverpool fans around the world were appalled that another team was allowed to win league titles in their presence. How dare they. Then, after the avalanche of money Roman Ambramovich invested, Liverpool self-appointed Chelsea as one of their new-age rivals and repeatedly mocked the club for their lack of class and attempts to buy success.  I believe the Liverpool song goes “Fuck off, Chelsea FC. You ain’t got no history.” Liverpool then sold their club twice in the space of three years to wealthy American entrepreneurs in a move they refuse to believe to be hypocritical as they continue to see their American empire as everything that is good and organic about English football.

&nbsp;

**Conclusion**

&nbsp;

I hope you liked my brief history of Liverpool Football Club. To finish I would just like to let you all know that I am a veteran historian on the subject of hating Liverpool and my opinion can be trusted as fact.

&nbsp;

Fuck off, Liverpool.

"If Manchester United fail to win the UEFA Champions League, they'll be on their worst trophy drought since the club was last relegated","United were last relegated in 1974, to the old Second Division. Since then, their trophy droughts have been the following:

**May 1974-May 1977**

* 3 years

**August 1977-May 1983**

* 5 years, 10 months

**August 1983-May 1985**

* 1 year, 10 months

**May 1985-May 1990**

* 5 years

**August 1994-May 1996**

* 1 year, 10 months

**August 1997-May 1999**

* 1 year, 10 months

**May 2001-May 2003**

* 2 years

**May 2004-February 2006**

* 1 year, 10 months

**August 2011-May 2013**

* 1 year, 10 months

**August 2013-May 2016**

* 2 years, 10 months

**May 2017-present**

* 4 years, 8 months

The present drought is guaranteed to go on until at least May, where United will have to pull off an unlikely Champions League win to end it at 5 years. Failure to do so will see the League Cup Final of 2023, set to be played in March, become their next chance at silverware. This would ensure the club goes at least 5 years and 10 months without a trophy, equalling the 1977-83 run that is the current longest drought.",https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/smk5li/if_manchester_united_fail_to_win_the_uefa/,Mental_Rooster4455,2022-02-07 12:17:52,3471,soccer
Analysis: How many less miles Les Miles would travel if the 2020 season is cancelled,"I think it is a fair assessment to assume that all of us have the same thought about the upcoming 2020 season and potential cancellation. How could this impact Kansas and more importantly Les Miles’ frequent flyer reward miles? Well I figured I would help ease some minds in these troubling times by taking one more worry off your plate. So, let’s find out how many less miles Les Miles would travel if the 2020 season is cancelled!


First, let’s take a look at all the 2020 regular season away games Kansas has plus the distance between them and David Booth Kansas Memorial Stadium:

(Distance is measured as a direct path or as the crow flies and doubled for returning).

* @ Baylor: 525 x2 = 1050 miles 
* @ Coastal Carolina: 975 x2 = 1950 miles
* @ Kansas State: 75 x2 = 150 miles
* @ West Virginia: 825 x2 = 1650 miles
* @ Texas Tech: 525 x2 = 1050 miles 
* @ Oklahoma: 300 x2 = 600 miles
 
Second, we will take a look at home games. As much fun as it is to picture Les living at the stadium, I don’t think he would be caught dead living on turf. Now I don’t know where his home is in Kansas and was told very kindly to stop calling by the Kansas Athletic Department but I think I found the next best thing.  I found a nice field of grass about five miles away from the stadium which I think has more than enough room for him to graze to his heart’s content. So for this exercise we will be going with 5 miles per home game for commute each way.

* V New Hampshire: 5 x2 = 10 miles
* V Boston College: 5 x2 = 10 miles
* V Iowa State: 5 x2 = 10 miles
* V Oklahoma State: 5 x2 = 10 miles
* V Texas: 5 x2 = 10 miles
* V TCU: 5 x2 = 10 miles

Finally, we calculate the post season totals. Now there is some conjecture as to where Kansas would end up in the 2020 post season but I think we all know what the end result is. And that’s a Big 12 Championship baby!

* @ Oklahoma (AT&T Stadium Arlington, Texas): 450 x2 = 900 miles

Naturally the only path forward after becoming Big 12 Champions is for Les to proceed to defeat Clemson in the Peach Bowl playoffs. And just as Vegas is currently predicting, Les Miles leading Kansas will face his former school and defending national champions LSU in the College Football Championship. Final score 52-3, all hail your 2020 College Football National Champions, THE Kansas Jayhawks!

* @ Clemson (Peach Bowl Mercedes-Benz Stadium Atlanta, GA): 700 x2 = 1400 miles
* @ LSU (CFP Championship Hard Rock Stadium Miami Gardens, FL): 1250 x2 = 2500 miles

Basking in our new Jayhawk overlord glory, however, is not what we set out to discover. We set out on a mission. Without football, we could assume that Les Miles wouldn’t make these trips but we would also have to assume he wouldn’t make any out of the ordinary travel trips. I think this is a safe assumption. Again, without football, Les wouldn’t even be able to participate in his second favorite hobby which is stealing football trophies while drinking Dr. Pepper. This is largely due to the strict quarantine currently being implemented by the mayor of Fansville. With options limited, Les would most likely ride out his time in his favorite green pasture dreaming of 2021 kickoff. Leading us to the only logical conclusion.

If the college football season would be cancelled, Les Miles would travel 11,310 less miles in 2020.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/ftne2v/analysis_how_many_less_miles_les_miles_would/,RollWarTideEagle,2020-04-02 19:35:12,3386,CFB
I ran Franchise Hockey Manager until every team without a cup won at least once. Most of us won't live to see the last team win.,"11 NHL franchises have never won a Stanley Cup. Four have never even played in a Cup Final. If you watch sports solely to see your team win a championship, you will likely be disappointed. In a league of 31 teams playing a game where the way a piece of rubber bounces across a sheet of ice can change destinies, even the professionals have to accept a level of influence from an indifferent universe. As fans, watching it all unfold without being able to offer any input at all can be maddening. Some fans joke, or seriously worry, that they won’t see a championship in their lifetime. But, thanks to Franchise Hockey Manger, we can simulate as many lifetimes as we need. We will follow the Arizona Coyotes, Buffalo Sabres, Columbus Blue Jackets, Florida Panthers, Minnesota Wild, Nashville Predators, Ottawa Senators, San Jose Sharks, Winnipeg Jets, Vancouver Canucks, and Vegas Golden Knights until they have all lifted the greatest trophy in sports. I will not manipulate the simulation to help them. You may argue that letting a computer program play this all out will produce an entirely arbitrary result. I would argue that you’re probably right, but the cruel whimsy of fate is part of why we love sports to begin with. 

&nbsp;

**2019/20:** This season is replayed from scratch, starting with the original opening night lineups. In the real world, just four of our 11 protagonists were in a playoff spot before the shutdown. FHM gives us four as well, although the field of Buffalo, San Jose, Columbus, and Winnipeg looks different than what we were expecting. Buffalo and San Jose go out with just a single win between them, but the Jets and Blue Jackets cruise to their respective Conference Finals. The Jackets defeat the Leafs, but the Jets lose to the Flames. Who then go on to defeat the Jackets. This is the one situation where I don’t want the Flames to win, and they’ve gone and done just that. Let’s hope that, and those three series going 6, 6, and 6, are not omens. 

&nbsp;

**2020/21:** I’ve excised the Seattle expansion, because its fans and future fans have not yet suffered any real-life disappointment. This experiment is about alleviating suffering, or perhaps prolonging it to horrifying extremes. Seattle’s pain must develop naturally.

&nbsp;

The Canucks, Jets, and Blue Jackets all win their divisions, and the Sabres and Sharks qualify too. San Jose and Buffalo again exit with a whimper and, while our trio of division winners all advance to the second round, all fail to advance beyond it. The Canucks are knocked out in six by the Flames, who go on to repeat by sweeping Carolina. I must reiterate that I’m not manipulating the simulation. 

&nbsp;


**2021/22:** The Jackets and Jets return to the playoffs, and this year they’re accompanied by the Panthers, Predators, and Coyotes. But only the Jets advance beyond the first round, needing just nine games to dispatch both Nashville and Dallas before they lose in five to, I’m so sorry, the Pacific division winning Calgary Flames. If it’s any consolation, the Flames are denied the three-peat, as the Flyers, who started the playoffs by dispatching the Jackets in six, also win the Cup in six. 

&nbsp;

**2022/23:** This year it’s the Panthers, Sabres, Canucks, Predators, and Jets who get a shot at breaking the drought. Only the Predators and Sabres advance beyond the first round (apparent perennial threat Calgary knocks out Vancouver in six). Nashville and Buffalo lose to the Stars and Leafs in five in their respective Conference Finals, after which the Leafs need just another five games to secure their first Cup since 1967. A drought has been broken, but it’s not the one we’re looking to address. Even when Toronto wins they screw up.  

&nbsp;

**2023/24:** The Sabres win their division, and the Jackets, Coyotes, Jets, Predators, and Wild all secure spots to give us our most promising field yet. Three teams lose hard fought seven game series, while the Coyotes sweep the Flames but are then swept by the Oilers. The Predators and Sabres make it all the way to their Conference Finals but lose in five and four, respectively. The Oilers and Devils wage a hard-fought, seven game battle for a Cup that goes to New Jersey. We’ve made no progress, but at least I can enjoy the tears of digital Oilers fans. 

&nbsp;

**2024/25:** We’re back to just four challengers, with the Panthers, Sharks, Canucks, and Jets representing the ranks of the Cupless. The Oilers and Flames knock out the Canucks and Sharks, while the Jets and Panthers stall out in the second round. The Oilers go on to win a six game Battle of Alberta, a four game sweep of the Kings, and a seven game epic against the Red Wings. They are, ew, Stanley Cup champions, and have punished the hubris of my previous paragraph. 

&nbsp;

**2025/26:** The Sabres win their division, while strong Preds, Sharks, and Knights teams join the field. With the appearance of Vegas, only the Ottawa Senators have yet to appear in this experiment. Their playoff drought goes back to 2017/18.

&nbsp;

The Sharks and Predators make the second round. The former push the defending champions to seven before bowing out, while the latter are crushed in five by a Colorado juggernaut that goes on to win a thrilling seven game series against the Penguins. At the end of the season, Alexander Ovechkin announces his retirement. He leaves the league 17 goals behind Wayne Gretzky’s all-time record. 

&nbsp;

**2026/27:** This is a promising year. The Wild and Golden Knights win their divisions, while the Sabres, Jets, Coyotes, and Canucks also qualify. The Coyotes show no mercy to their Cupless brethren, defeating Vancouver in seven before knocking out Las Vegas and Minnesota in two six game series. With the Sabres and Jets dropping out in the first round, the Coyotes are the second Cupless team to reach the Stanley Cup Finals in this experiment, and it’s the first of their now 30-year history in Arizona. 

It is anticlimactic. But, for Coyotes fans, it is anticlimactic in the best way possible. Arizona cruises to a four game sweep of the Toronto Maple Leafs. Led by returnee Dylan Strome and his 28 playoff points, the Arizona Coyotes are Stanley Cup Champions. One down, 10 to go.

&nbsp; 

**2027/28:** The grim irony of this experiment is that, like with so many things in life, each success makes the next success just a little bit harder to achieve. Still, half of our seekers -- the Jackets, Canucks, Predators, Wild, and Jets -- all get a crack this year. Three of those teams promptly lose, although the Wild’s loss in a seven game opening series is Winnipeg’s victory. But it’s Nashville that draws eyes this year. Inspired by last year’s sight of Arizona lifting the first cup in franchise history, they rampage through the playoffs. After a thrilling seven game nail-biter against Chicago, they defeat the Jets and Avs in five each. Momentum appears to be on their side. Destiny appears to be on their side. They won their division. They racked up 105 points. Will they be the second team in as many years to win their first Cup?

No. They lose to Philadelphia in five. The 106 point Flyers lost just two games across the entire playoffs. A hot team is extinguished by a team going supernova. Sometimes sports are cruel. 

&nbsp;

**2028/29:** The Nashville Predators win the Stanley Cup. Sometimes sports are a lesson in delayed gratification. 

In the regular season the Preds regressed to 95 points, but the hard lessons learned from last year’s Finals had clearly stuck. The Jets, Sharks, and Wild joined them in this year’s dance, and the Predators showed absolutely no mercy in immediately sweeping Winnipeg. After again taking out Colorado, this year in six, they met San Jose, who had dispatched Minnesota in seven back in the first round. They are once again merciless to their fellows in extended suffering, shoving them aside in five. The Cup Finals against Pittsburgh are a challenge, but nothing they can’t handle over six games. Filip Forsberg’s dominant 92 regular season points and 26 playoff points have brought an entire city joy and an entire franchise a slice of immortality. Nine teams watch on with increasingly frustrated envy.

&nbsp;

**2029/30:** The east is shutout, but the Golden Knights, Sharks, Canucks, and Wild represent our shrinking field. The Golden Knights, for good measure, even win their division with 110 points. They look good in the playoffs. They look real good. They beat the Sharks and Flames in five, then the defending champs in six. But, much like Nashville two years before, they run into a team that’s even hotter. The 111 point Rangers defeat them in five. 

Despite the anticlimactic finish to their season, there are many reasons for Vegas to be excited for next year. It would be almost prophetic for them to repeat the script of a promising Cupless team losing the Finals in five, only to return with a vengeance the following season. 

&nbsp;

**2030/31:** The New York Rangers win the Stanley Cup. Again. Vancouver, San Jose, and Minnesota all returned to the playoffs, but Las Vegas’ 69 point season sees them miss the playoffs entirely. Our smallest Cupless field since this experiment began saw all three teams advance to the second round, where the Canucks took down the Flames in seven while Minnesota defeated Winnipeg in five. A passionate all Canadian, all Cupless Western Conference Finals sees the Jets emerge after six games but, six games later, New York had broken the hearts of two cities in as many years. Dick move, New York. Dick move. 

&nbsp;

**2031/32:** The Senators (did you forget they were in this experiment?) win their division, qualifying them for their first postseason since 2016/17. They lose in the first round, although they do give Boston a seven game fight. 

The Canucks and Wild are our only other teams, and they’re forced to play each other in the first round. Vancouver wins in six, then defeats Arizona in another six, but then they lose in five to, oh no I really am sorry, the Calgary Flames. The Flames then defeat the Red Wings in five more games for another Cup. 

When, in reality, the Calgary Flames won their only Stanley Cup, I was barely a year old. My father tells me I celebrated by urinating on him. As an adult in this hypothetical future I have been able to witness them win three more Cups, but every single one of them has served only to prolong this experiment.

&nbsp;  

**2032/33:** The Blue Jackets return to the playoffs, joining a strong Cupless field that also includes Vancouver, San Jose, Minnesota, and Winnipeg (Ottawa has already returned to irrelevance). The Wild sweep the Jets, making them the only team of the five to advance to the second round. There they sweep again, this time against Chicago, before losing to Arizona in seven. The recently Cupless are now prolonging the torment of the teams they could once identify with. If it’s any consolation to their former fellows, the Coyotes lose the Cup to the Islanders in six. 

During the offseason, Connor McDavid retires. Although it will still be a few more years before every player active today leaves the league, we are approaching the point where FHM’s rosters will be entirely fictional. When that happens I will, in one sense, just be spinning an roulette wheel until the ball lands in the right slots. But this program can still capture the ebbs and flows of declines and rebuilds, of bad ownership and missed opportunities. And, perhaps most importantly, it can still capture some of the ineffable horror that embodies a long-suffering fandom. In a league of this size, much suffering is inevitable. 

&nbsp;

**2033/34:** The Panthers return to the playoffs, joined only by Vancouver and Vegas. Only Florida wins a round, scraping out a seven game victory over Toronto, before losing to Pittsburgh in six. See? Suffering. The Penguins go on to the final, but fall in six to the Ducks.

&nbsp;

**2034/35:** The Sabres win their division, San Jose finishes second in the Pacific, and Winnipeg also squeaks in before losing in seven to the Avs. Buffalo wins in seven over Pittsburgh but, in another grueling seven game series, falls to Boston. The Bruins march on to the Cup Finals, where they will face the San Jose Sharks.

Both teams have had hard roads. San Jose needed seven against both the Ducks and the Kings, then six against Chicago. Boston’s played just one game fewer. All signs point to another long, agonising series. Instead, it is a sweep. Led by Conn Smythe winning defencemen Dan Stevens, the San Jose Sharks are Stanley Cup champions. Eight teams remain.

&nbsp;

**2035/36:** Seven teams remain. Half of our shrinking Cupless ranks -- Columbus, Buffalo, Vancouver, and Minnesota -- qualified this year. The Blue Jackets fall in the first round, the Canucks in the second. In the Conference Finals, the Wild defeat the Ducks in six but the Devils cruelly deny us an all Cupless Finals thanks to their seven game victory over Buffalo. But Minnesota doesn’t care about quibbles like that. After an easy five game series, the Minnesota Wild are Stanley Cup champions. 

&nbsp;

**2036/37:** The momentum for the Cupless can’t continue. Winnipeg, Vancouver, Buffalo, Columbus, and Ottawa all suffer first round defeats. Ottawa’s five game loss is to the Panthers, who go out in five to the Bruins. Those Bruins advance to the Finals but lose in six to the Ducks.

&nbsp;

**2036/37:** Vancouver, Columbus, Vegas, and Ottawa reach the postseason. But Vegas, Columbus, and Ottawa go out in the first round (after again losing to Boston in seven, it has now been 20 years since the Senators have won a playoff series), and Vancouver goes out a round later to Calgary in five. In the Cup Finals, the Avs sweep the Islanders. 

&nbsp;

**2038/39:** The Jackets, Knights, Canucks, and Jets get another shot at ending the pain. It’s promising that so many of our shrinking field can still qualify, and Vegas and Columbus both reach their Conference Finals. But five game losses to the Blues and Bruins instead gives us a rematch of 2018/19, and while this installment only goes five games the Blues again emerge victorious. 

&nbsp;

**2039/40:** We are now 20 years removed from reality, and a new decade brings new promise. The Canucks, Knights, and Sabres will attempt to make the most of it. With only Vancouver managing to escape the first round (in a five game defeat of Arizona), it looks to be another dour year for Cupless teams. But then they defeat the Oilers in six. And then they defeat the defending champion Blues in another six. In the Finals, they will meet the New York Rangers, who were terrorising Cupless teams a decade ago. The tradition continues.

Sorry, I meant *a* tradition continues. The tradition of Cupless teams winning easy, anticlimactic Cup Finals. After five games, the Vancouver Canucks are Stanley Cup champions. FHM is not yet sophisticated enough to tell us what happens to the city of Vancouver in the aftermath. Six teams remain. 

&nbsp;

**2040/41:** Vegas and Buffalo return to the playoffs, and Columbus joins them. Like last season, two teams lose in the first round. And, like last season, one team goes all the way. After six games against Tampa Bay, a sweep of Toronto, and two more six game wins against Carolina and St. Louis, the Buffalo Sabres are Stanley Cup champions. It has taken the franchise 71 years. Fans who witness this moment will think of friends and family who couldn’t. Five teams remain.

&nbsp; 

**2041/42:** Vegas and Columbus return to the playoffs, and Florida joins them. Like last season, two teams lose in the first round. And, like last season, one team goes all the way. If that sounds familiar, that’s because this is a golden age for Cupless teams. But will it be the Golden Knights or the Blue Jackets that emulate the Sabres in learning from recent defeats?

It will be neither. After a four year absence from the playoffs, the Panthers defeat the Jackets in six, sweep the Lightning, squeak past the Flyers in seven, then sweep the Blues who, in a reverse-Rangers, have lost two Finals in a row to Cupless teams. The Florida Panthers are Stanley Cup champions. Three Cupless teams have won in as many years, and only four remain. After some initial bumps, this experiment appears to be going well. But while some golden ages come to crashing halts, others can decline so gradually that, in the end, you don’t even realise that you’ve arrived in hell.  

&nbsp;

**2042/43:** The slim ranks of the Cupless teams are beginning to feel desperate. Columbus and Vegas are playoffs perennials that can’t quite get over the hump, a generation of promise in Winnipeg has given way to an extended absence, and the Senators have had two playoff appearances in a quarter century. Only Vegas qualifies this year, and they go out in six to Colorado. In the Finals, the Devils defeat the Predators in six.

&nbsp;

**2043/44:** Vegas is again the only team to qualify, and they again go out in the first round. The Islanders defeat the Avs in five.

&nbsp;

**2044/45:** Vegas is now joined by Winnipeg and Columbus. Winnipeg’s return is short-lived—they lose in six to the Wild—while Columbus defeats the Rangers in seven but can’t handle a second helping of New York in a five game loss to the Islanders. But the Golden Knights are battle hardened. They’re frustrated by their recent first round exits, and they take their frustrations out on the division winning Ducks by sweeping them. The Sharks are defeated in seven, the Stars in five. The defending champion Islanders await.

It is a brutal, dramatic series that goes the distance. The Golden Knights are in their first Cup final since 2030, and they don’t want to lose to another New York team. But the universe doesn’t care what we want. Las Vegas loses game seven, and the Islanders repeat. Vegas is now 0-3 in Cup Finals. 

&nbsp;

**2045/46:** Remember when Vegas lost the 2030 Finals? And I said they could build off of the experience, they could come back stronger next year, yadda yadda yadda, and then they had a miserable season? I should have saved that theory.

The Vegas Golden Knights win the Presidents’ Trophy. The first round sees the Jets lose while the Blue Jackets and, shock of shocks, the Senators, are absent entirely. But Vegas defeats the Canucks in six. They sweep the Sharks. They sweep the Avs. They do not sweep the Red Wings, who push them to another Cup Final game seven. Nervous fans are tired of seeing this script unfold before them. But the Golden Knights built off experience. They came back stronger. The Vegas Golden Knights become Stanley Cup champions. Three teams remain. 

&nbsp;

**2046/47:** For the first season since this experiment began, no Cupless team qualifies for the playoffs. After a seven game Finals against Vancouver the Islanders become a modern dynasty by winning their third Stanley Cup in four years. 

&nbsp;

**2047/48:** Columbus and Winnipeg lose in the first round. Vegas wins their second Cup in three years with a sweep of the Rangers. Revenge feels good. 

&nbsp;

**2048/49:** Winnipeg loses an opening round matchup to Colorado for the second straight year, and this one is a sweep. Columbus misses the playoffs, while Ottawa fans struggle to remember what the playoffs even feel like. In a seven game Finals between the Flyers and the Predators, Nashville emerges victorious.

&nbsp;

**2049/50:** The Jets reason that they can’t lose to the Avs in the playoffs if they don’t make the playoffs. There is no evidence that the Senators reason at all. But the Blue Jackets intend to make their golden anniversary in Columbus a memorable one, and they win their division with a 102 point season. They live up to the seeding, cruising past the Devils in five. The Penguins fall in six. So do the Leafs. 

Hot Cupless teams have, over the course of these decades, struggled against even hotter Finals opponents. But this year the West is fractured. The Presidents’ Trophy winning Avalanche were swept by the Blackhawks, prompting middle-aged Reddit users to recount some of their greatest memes. Those Hawks couldn’t capitalise on the momentum and fell to the Wild, who then advanced past the Oilers to reach the Finals. The Blue Jackets, a model of consistency this year, defeat them in six. The Columbus Blue Jackets are Stanley Cup champions. A half-century of shortcomings feel like they’ve been erased over night. Two teams remain. 

&nbsp;

**Interregnum (2050/51 – 2059/60):** We should be witness to an epic duel to avoid the cruel fate of being the league’s last Cupless team. We instead descend into a sad farce. The entirety of the 2050s sees the Ottawa Senators muster up just one first round loss, and the Jets outperform them with two. 

&nbsp;

**2060/61:** The Senators reappear in the playoffs and promptly lose to the Islanders, making it well over 40 years since their last series victory. But the Jets finally get some revenge against the Avalanche over the course of a gruelling seven game series, and then the Wild fall in seven as well. The Predators are swept away, pitting the Jets against the Flyers for the Cup. 

Much of the hockey world is pulling for the Jets. They couldn’t win a Cup in their original NHL years. The franchise couldn’t win a Cup in Atlanta. The Jets haven’t won a cup since their return to Winnipeg in 2011. In 2061, in a series that’s fought over a titanic seven games, the Winnipeg Jets do not win a Stanley Cup.

&nbsp;

**2061/62:** The Senators and Jets both miss the playoffs. Jets fans wonder how many more years of suffering last year’s defeat has consigned them to. Senators fans have ascended beyond the traditional understanding of suffering to achieve either an advanced state of enlightenment or an advanced state of alcoholism. 

&nbsp;

**2062/63:** The Winnipeg Jets face the Chicago Blackhawks in the first round, and win in six. The Ottawa Senators face the Montreal Canadiens in the first round and, after seven games, win their first playoff series since 2016/17. In that 46 year gap, some Senator fans will have lived and died without witnessing a single series victory. But now, in a year where the only two Cupless teams remaining both managed to advance to the second round, it feels like it should be fate for them to meet in an epic Finals that will be talked about throughout the ages.

Both teams lose round two game sevens.

&nbsp;

**2063/64:** The Senators build on their round two game seven loss to the Red Wings with a round one game seven loss to the Red Wings, because no matter the era Ottawa ownership does not understand the concept of “build.” Winnipeg, however, marches on. Their 112 point season is good for second in the league, behind that titanic 127 point Detroit team. The Jets live up to the expectations of their long suffering fanbase by defeating the Coyotes and Blackhawks in five, then the Kings in six. Three seasons after suffering a heartbreaking game seven Cup Finals loss, the Jets will have to face an overwhelmingly talented Red Wings team.

No one would fault the Jets for losing here. This Wings team is one of the best the league has seen in decades. And, that sad gap in their trophy case aside, two Cup Finals in four years would be a lot for the Jets to build on. Winnipeg fans are supportive, but they are also realistic. When they go to another game seven, it’s hard for them to feel any optimism. It feels like they’ve seen this story before, only now their opponent is a minor deity. Fate, they feel, is simply stacked against them, and they are resigned to that. 

The Winnipeg Jets win the Stanley Cup. The Ottawa Senators are the only NHL franchise still wandering through the desert. 

&nbsp;

**Purgatory (2064/65 – 2074/75):** The Senators are… okay. They qualify for the playoffs six times, their best 10 year stretch since this experiment began, and they win three first round series. It is as though, with the pressure of the Cupless race over, they can focus on simply being a competent hockey franchise. “Okay” isn’t nearly good enough to win a Cup, but it’s a start. 

&nbsp;

**2075/76:** An 89 point Senators season feels much like the 10 seasons that have just preceded it. Ottawa is decent, but unremarkable. They will go to the playoffs and, thanks to their first wild card slot placing them against a Rangers team that won their division with just 95 points, their more optimistic fans think they can even win a series. They do, in six, which is nice.

Then they defeat the Islanders in six.

Then they defeat the Bruins in six.

This is suddenly a team of destiny. When the 200th anniversary of Canadian Confederation rolled around in 2067, the Senators were derided for being the only Canadian franchise without a Cup. Perhaps instead, on the 300th anniversary of American independence, the Senators can free themselves from hockey purgatory. The city of Ottawa is excited about hockey in a way it hasn’t been in the lifetime of most of its citizens. This is their moment. It has to be.

The Senators lose to the Oilers in five. 

Goddammit, Ottawa. 

&nbsp;

**2076/77:** The Ottawa Senators miss the playoffs. The Edmonton Oilers win their third straight Stanley Cup. 

*Fuck.* 

&nbsp;

**The Hell Years (2077/78 – 2093/94):** Over a 16-year stretch the Ottawa Senators qualify for the playoffs just five times. In 2079 they reach the Conference Finals, losing in seven to the Capitals, and in 2090 they manage to reach the second round before losing in six to the Lightning. This is a fate far worse than purgatory. Fans in Ottawa had a taste of opportunity, and it turned to ash in their mouths. 

&nbsp;

**2094/95:** The Ottawa Senators began their first NHL season 103 years ago. Children born in Ottawa as I write this, babes who are being swaddled lovingly in Senators blankets, will turn 75-years-old. If you are an 18-year-old Senators fan reading this today you will be 93, perhaps a grandparent or great-grandparent who regales your descendants with tales of your legendary shitposting. Assuming, of course, that Sens-fandom induced cirrhosis hasn’t killed you long ago. Most of you reading this will have died for one reason or another, and the vast majority of the players we watched this year and in years past will have also passed away. 

In 2095, in a world that will bare little resemblance to the one we live in today, the Ottawa Senators skate to a competent but unremarkable 43-35-4 season, good for third in a weak Atlantic division. In the first round of the playoffs they face the Montreal Canadiens who, having not won the Stanley Cup since 1992-93, are facing their own century long existential crisis. The Senators win in six games, and fans will at least be happy that they’ll suffer a bit less than their long-time rivals this year. If you’re going through hell you’re told you should keep going, but it helps to see some other poor bastard getting it even worse while you do.   

One of the things that fascinates me about sports is its ability to transcend time. Were you to be dropped 75 years into the past you may not have many of the same opinions or cultural touchstones of those around you, but you could all still agree that you want your team to put the puck in the net. Time also gives meaning to sports, as much of the drama comes from knowing that the events and opportunities we witness may not come around again for a long, long while. 75 years are, after all, a long time. In the second round of the 2095 NHL playoffs, the Senators defeat the Red Wings in six and advance to their first Conference Finals since 2079. 

75 years ago World War II was wrapping up, and much of what we take for granted today -- norms, technologies, nations -- did not exist. I can’t even begin to conceive of what the world will look like 75 years from now, nor can I really conceive of the fact that I will almost certainly no longer exist to witness it. But I can tell you that, over six games, the Ottawa Senators will defeat the Pittsburgh Penguins and advance to face the Vegas Golden Knights in the Stanley Cup Finals. 

On the cusp of the 22nd century, I imagine that even hockey will look quite different from how it does today. The sport today certainly looks quite different from how it did on the cusp of the 20th and 21st centuries. But hopefully people will still love it, and that will be enough. It’s been 202 years since the Stanley Cup was first awarded and, after a five game series, it will be awarded to the Ottawa Senators.

Character Concepts For Every Class/Background Combination,"Backgrounds are an often neglected part of 5th Edition D&D build discussion, primarily because they are centered around roleplay, and will differ greatly from character to character. In the interest of generating more discussion about the roleplay aspect of D&D, I created a short backstory concept for every possible class and background combination of the 12 classes and 13 backgrounds in the PHB.

I've been posting regular updates on /r/3d6 for each class, and had some help with some of the class/background combinations. I'll provide a link to the original posts if you want to view the discussion yourself. Just as a warning, some of these may be very similar or duplicates, as there is a bit of overlap between classes and backgrounds. Enjoy!

**Fighter, Acolyte** - Templar: You have taken up the sword and the shield for a religious cause, fighting in service of a deity.

**Monk, Charlatan** - False Messiah: You have gained significant fame after claiming to be the reincarnation of a long-dead warrior or wise man, and offer wisdom to any who are willing to pay.

By day, you are still a wealthy merchant and are famous for your great parties - but at night, the shadow side of you strikes. /u/Bamboori

**Monk, Soldier** - Scout: You served under an army by acting as a scout, traveling ahead to observe the nearby terrain and keep an eye out for any approaching threats. While you did not fight the enemy directly, you still know how to handle yourself in combat.

**Monk, Urchin** - Bloodsport: With no money to your name, you entered an illegal fighting tournament to win some extra coin. You fought well against other untrained combatants, and learned how to survive a fight against a foe.

**Paladin, Charlatan** - Double Agent: You introduce yourself to others as a faithful servant of a specific church or deity; in actuality, this is a lie, and you really serve a different deity. You infiltrated a rival church to gain intelligence on them, and to sabotage their mission whenever you can.

**Paladin, Criminal** - Dark Knight: Not every faithful warrior of the church is a law-abiding citizen. While your faith in your deity is unwavering, your allegiance to the government is not. Lawless Paladins are usually Blackguards, but not always; if the crown is corrupt and tyrannical, it might be the duty of a pious Paladin to break the law and fight against the government.

**Paladin, Entertainer** - Recovering Hedonist: You used to be a talented performer with a bad vice, such as drugs, alcohol, or romance. After your addiction ruined your career and almost ended your life, you went to the church for salvation. After vowing to swear off your bad habit, you became a redeemed champion of your deity.

**Paladin, Folk Hero** - Chosen One: You were a commoner who regularly prayed to your favored deity for guidance and protection, although you didn't work for the church in any official capacity. One night, you received a vision from your god telling you to take up arms and go on a quest for the greater good. You eagerly obliged, and bought what weapons you could to fulfill your god's will.

**Paladin, Guild Artisan** - Purchased Salvation: After working as a traveling merchant for many years, your family came into some shady dealings and selling of mysterious artifacts. After purchasing a particularly nasty trinket you and your family have been cursed. The only way to have the curse lifted was by selling all your possessions and devoting the rest of your life to a just cause. Should you waiver, the curse on you and your family will return. /u/SugarPlumWizard

**Paladin, Hermit** - Born Again: After accidentally committing an evil act, you entered seclusion to find atonement for your crime. After months of long prayer and meditation, the gods spoke to you and offered forgiveness if you would become a champion of the faith. You graciously accepted.

**Paladin, Outlander** - Green Knight: You were the protector of a sacred grove in the wilderness that was blessed by a divine nature deity.

**Paladin, Soldier** - Crusader: You were a fought in a great holy war, waged by order of your god against a heretical foe. You may have crusaded into the Nine Hells, or into the lair of a powerful Lich. Regardless of where you fought, the brutal fighting changed you as a person.

**Paladin, Urchin** - Orphan: Unable to care for you on their own, your parents left you on the doorstep of a church when you were a baby. Growing up under the care of nuns and priests has lead you down the path of paladinship.

**Ranger, Criminal** - Highwayman: You were a thief that stole from travelers on the road, far from civilization and law enforcement. While you may have been a terror to those you faced, some robbers may have gained a good reputation with common folk by only stealing from the rich and giving their stolen wealth to the poor.

**Ranger, Entertainer** - Animal Tamer: You joined a traveling circus with your loyal animal companion to make some money. You and your companion have become a popular attraction with audience members, performing daring tricks and humorous comedic routines.

**Ranger, Folk Hero** - Messenger: After you spotted a monstrous horde approaching your village while you were out hunting, you sneaked past them and ran back to your village to alert them to ready the militia. Had it not been for your bravery and stealth, the village would have been overwhelmed.

**Ranger, Sailor** - Navigator: You were the member of the navigation crew on a ship, plotting the destination and making sure the ship didn't fall off course. When the need arised, you also served as an excellent swordsman.

**Ranger, Soldier** - Deserter: You were a soldier that feared an approaching threat and decided to go AWOL. You fled in the dead of night, and had to take refuge in a hostile environment to escape capture and certain execution. While the terrain was harsh, you managed to evade capture and learned to survive in the wilderness for long periods of time.

**Ranger, Urchin** - Wild Child: After a childhood of neglect and poverty, you ran away from home and took solace in the wilderness. While there, you met a family of animals who nurtured you as one of their own. You hunted and ate with them, and used your human intellect to steal from farmers and travelers.

#[Rogue](https://www.reddit.com/r/3d6/comments/brz5ld/classbackground_character_concepts_rogue/)

**Rogue, Charlatan** - Gambler: You have made a living as a professional gambler, betting on gladiatorial matches, cockfights, horse racing, or games of chance to win big. When the odds are not to your liking, you always make sure to have a trick up your sleeve, such as weighted dice, blackmail, or—on especially important bets—poison. If people start getting suspicious, you can set up a new identity in a new town at the drop of a hat, and start all over again.

**Rogue, Criminal** - Robber: You have become skilled in the art of robbery; you hold up banks or people, shake them down for money, then flee before the militia arrives. While dangerous, your talents have earn you money and respect in the criminal underworld.

**Rogue, Entertainer** - Dancer: Your nimbleness has given you a gift in the art of dancing. You entertain crowds at concerts with a dancing routine, such as ballet, tap dance, or freestyle. Your skills as a dancer translate well on the battlefield, allowing you to 'dance' around your enemies to gain the upper hand.

**Rogue, Folk Hero** - Outlaw: The greedy noble of your town levies a high tax against the poor commoners, who are constantly menaced by the corrupt town guard. You took matters into your own hands, and stole a great deal of wealth from the noble to give to the poor people. While the theft made you an enemy of the noble, you became adored by the people for the act.

**Rogue, Guild Artisan** - Artist: You are a talented artist who sells their works for coin. Not all artists use a canvas and brush; you might be a sculptor, potter, or calligrapher. Your nimble hands and perfectionist attitude makes you deadly with a blade or bow.

**Rogue, Hermit** - Secret Society: You are the child of a member of a secret society of thieves or assassins. You were raised from birth to continue the family legacy and carry out missions for the society. Your motivations might be monetary, hereditary, or philosophical.

**Rogue, Noble** - Duelist: Fencing is a popular sport among aristocracy, seen as more refined than wrestling or horse racing. You have made a name for yourself among your family as an excellent fencer, and pay more focus towards your next duel than the goings-on of the aristocratic world.

**Rogue, Outlander** - Longhunter: You are a skilled explorer who has made expeditions into a frontier or other hospitable territory for months at a time. You may have been paid to explore a territory by orders of a king, or simply done it to see whats out there and make a name for yourself.

**Rogue, Sage** - Dungeoneer: You are a scholar of lost civilizations, and study the remnants of ancient tombs and catacombs. Your field of study calls for delving into dangerous environments and fighting hostile enemies, which you have become quite skilled at. While the work may be deadly, the reward of lost knowledge is sweet.

**Rogue, Sailor** - Pirate: You spent your youth under the sway of a dread pirate, a ruthless cutthroat who taught you how to survive in a world of sharks and savages. You've indulged in larceny on the high seas and sent more than one deserving soul to a briny grave. Fear and bloodshed are no strangers to you, and you've garnered a somewhat unsavory reputation in many a port town.

**Rogue, Soldier** - Skirmisher: You served in an army as a skirmisher, providing tactical assistance through flanking, ambushes, and reconnaissance. Fighting the enemy directly is unwise, and you would use every method available to you to gain the upper hand.

**Rogue, Urchin** - Hoodlum: With nobody to turn to in your youth, you joined a street gang for protection and company. You learned how to survive on the streets, and were taught how to pick locks, sneak in the shadows, and escape from the guards.

#[Sorcerer](https://www.reddit.com/r/3d6/comments/bsj061/classbackground_character_concepts_sorcerer/)

**Sorcerer, Acolyte** - Cultist: Your birth was prophesied by a secretive cult with sinister aims. You were raised by the cult to become their leader, and were foretold to bring about the end of days. Thankfully, the cult was destroyed by an order of paladins, who took you in after you were orphaned.

**Sorcerer, Charlatan** - Snake Oil Merchant: Your silver-tongued talents have given you a knack for selling merchandise, especially if the customer believes the products in question are worth more than they actually are. No refunds.

**Sorcerer, Criminal** - Illicit Bloodline: Sorcerers—at least, of your bloodline—are declared by law to be outlaws from birth by order of the crown, and meant to be smothered at birth. Your birth was hidden by your parents, and you managed to evade discovery during childhood. You have spent your entire life on the outskirts of society, hunted by the law because of the unfortunate circumstances of your birth.

**Sorcerer, Entertainer** - Freakshow: Your sorcerous origin has left you with a prominent supernatural mark or deformity that is difficult to hide. Unable to find employment due to your appearance, you joined a traveling carnival, where your disfigurement was shown to shocked and disgusted spectators. You made a decent amount of coin with the carnival, but always resented the dehumanizing work.

**Sorcerer, Folk Hero** - Protector: When your small village was threatened by a much larger foe, your sorcerous blood revealed itself. It may have revealed itself because of the stress, a near-fatal wound, or you could have knowingly kept it hidden this whole time. Regardless of its nature, you fought off the threat by yourself and became celebrated as a hero because of it.

**Sorcerer, Guild Artisan** - Purchased Power: You weren't born with your sorcerous ability, you bought it. You were a wealthy merchant with an interest in purchasing magical artifacts. Either intentionally or unintentionally, you purchased a magical relic that was salvaged from a dungeon that granted you magical ability when you came in contact with it. Perhaps the artifact belonged to a being of immense power, or simply needed to come in contact with your bloodline to be activated. You keep the object securely in your possession, and make sure not to lose it.

**Sorcerer, Hermit** - Enlightened: Your magical ability manifested itself after meditation and long isolation. You entered seclusion or joined a monastery to gain a greater understanding of your inner self. After a long period of self-contemplation, you discovered the spark of magic that burned within your soul, and learned how to control it.

**Sorcerer, Noble** - Blue Blood: A sorcerous bloodline is quite a valuable thing to marry into for those without magical ability; it is not unheard of for wealthy families to try and marry into sorcerous bloodlines to strengthen the family name and produce powerful offspring. You are the result of such a marriage, and are the youngest in a family of mage-aristocrats.

**Sorcerer, Outlander** - Feral Child: You were born under a bad omen, such as an eclipse, the death of a king, or on a Friday the 13th. Your superstitious parents abandoned you in the wilderness when you were an infant to escape misfortune, and left you to succumb to the elements. You survived, however; you were found by a wild animal who could sense the magic within you and sought to protect you as their own. You grew up knowing only your basic instincts, until you were found by a hunter.

**Sorcerer, Sage** - School For Gifted Youngsters: When your sorcerous powers revealed themselves to you when you were a child, you were sent to a school for the magically-inclined. While there, you learned to control your magical powers under the instruction of more senior sorcerers.

**Sorcerer, Sailor** - Monsoon-Born: You were born during a freak occurrence of weather, such as a flood, lightning storm, or tsunami. This caused you to have a natural affinity for the water, a talent that manifested as a skill for sailing and swimming. You were a member of a ship's crew, and aided them with your power to control wind and weather.

**Sorcerer, Soldier** - Super Soldier: Officers and generals are always looking for ways to use magic to make their armies the strongest in the land. The army you served in was subjected to a dangerous alchemical substance with the hopes of turning them into powerful warriors. Many of your comrades died or were disfigured as a result of the side-effects, but you were lucky enough to survive and be given magical talents as a result.

**Sorcerer, Urchin** - Familicide: Magical talent is difficult to control when you are young, especially if you live in a stressful or abusive environment. Your sorcerous powers manifested explosively when you were a child, which resulted in the death of your parents or caretakers. With no one left to look after you, you were reduced to living on the streets, using your wits and magical ability to survive.

**Preview:**

[France's pre-match Press Conference, featuring Deschamps and Lloris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuFoYuhKsn4) (32:35)

[Belgium's pre-match Press Conference, featuring Martinez and de Bruyne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdwNQ6U1ilQ) (29:45)

[The best highlights from the quarter-final stage.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXuP661DSCo) (2:42)

[Tifo Football's tactical preview:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqnmSIWTjg) (4:14)

France have conceded only three goals on the way to the semi-finals, and the central defensive pair snuffed out the attacking threat of Luis Suarez in the quarter-final against Uruguay, barely allowing him a touch in the penalty area. A very different threat approaches in Lukaku, who has scored 4 goals in 4, only 2 behind Golden Boot leader Harry Kane. The Belgian forward will no doubt be eager to stake a claim on the award with a few goals in this game.

France and Belgium have a long history, facing each other 73 times in total. France have won 24 of the meetings, with Belgium taking 30 victories, leaving 19 draws between them.

The last time France and Belgium played each other, however, was on 7 June 2015 at the Stade de France outside Paris. At that time in 2015, Samuel Umtiti, Benjamin Pavard, Lucas Hernandez, Corentin Tolisso, Ousmane Dembele and Kylian Mbappe had yet to earn their first French cap.

None of the four semi-finalists from the 2014 World Cup have made it to this stage this time around, in part thanks to these two teams; France defeated Argentina in the 'Round of 16', in a thrilling 4-3 game, and [Belgium scraped by Brazil in the last round](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8IK0ZqfxNI), winning 2-1 after an early Fernandinho own-goal, as well as a rocket from de Bruyne.

""We are on an equal footing with France,"" said Kevin De Bruyne, who scored the [crucial second goal](https://www.clippituser.tv/c/kaqzan), which just so happened to be the winning goal, in Belgium's quarter-final win over Brazil. ""We will try and do everything we can physically and mentally. That's all we can do. At the end, you do all you can to win and if they're better, they're better. That's football.""

Roberto Martinez's side are the tournament's top scorers so far, with 14 goals. The last team to have scored that many goals prior to the semi-final stage was Brazil in 2002...and of course they went on to become champions that year. A good omen for Belgium? 

With heaps of talent on both sides of the pitch, the game will come down to tactics and mentality as well as raw talent, which both teams have in abundance. France coach, Didier Deschamps, has led the national team in over 3x more international matches than his counterpart, Martinez. Deschamps being their longest-standing manager ever, Les Bleus have won 51 games, drawn 15, and lost 15 under his tutelage, including a loss in the final at Euro 2016, whilst Belgium under Martinez have an astounding record of 19 wins, 5 draws, and 1 loss since he took over in August of 2016. A 63% vs 76% win rate, albeit over different scales.

Regardless of result, a European team will win the World Cup this year. So much for *World* Cup ^/s. Having both secured their seats at the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia table until next weekend's fight for medals, France and Belgium now have to see who will be pursuing gold and who is left searching for bronze. A potentially career-crowning final is as little as an hour and a half of football away.

[](#sprite6-p17) Roberto Martinez has been forced into making a change on the right side of defence with Paris Saint-Germain's **Thomas Meunier** suspended for the game, as result of receiving bookings against Panama and Brazil. Mousa Dembélé comes in, for only his second start of the tournament.

[](#sprite6-p60) Juventus midfielder **Blaise Matuidi** was suspended, due to accumulated yellows, for France's 2-0 dismantling of Uruguay in the quarter-finals, but has come back into the team. His performance in the round of 16 was excellent. **Corentin Tolisso** drops to the bench.

[](#sprite6-p60) Young defender **Benjamin Pavard** keeps his place in the right side of the France defence, and main striker **Olivier Giroud**, fan favourite at Arsenal, and now at Chelsea, keeps his spot in the starting eleven, despite not yet recording a shot on target at this World Cup.

---

0': [](#icon-whistle) The referee blows, and France get the first Semi-Final underway!

1': Before Belgium even manage a touch, Mbappé does well with the ball on the right-side of the pitch, crosses the ball low, but it's intercepted. Early signs of attacking intent from the French side.

3': Quick break from Belgium finds Chadli on the wing with plenty of space, but he crosses early, and it's blocked for a throw in.

6': Hazard knocks the ball past Pavard, cutting it back on his left foot. It's put behind by Umtiti, but only just flashes past the post for a corner. 

7': The resultant corner from Chadli is poor, and the ball sails over the heads of everyone in the box and out for a goal kick.

10': France's first 'chance' since the very start of the game comes from a long ball up to Giroud, who knocks it back down. The ball is chipped over the Belgian defence to Mbappé. Being too far ahead of him, his outstretched boot can only get a slight touch on it, sending it just behind Giroud.

13': Great feet from Pogba to dance past Dembélé, before passing the ball down the field to a sprinting Mbappé. The pitch being thoroughly watered before kick-off means that it zips across the field, just ahead of the young French striker and into the gloves of Courtois, who comes off his line quickly.

16': France being sloppy in possession at the back means the ball falls to Kevin de Bruyne just outside the area. He puts a fantastic touch on the volley to send it past the defender to Eden Hazard. Hazard's low shot flashes just past the far post.

16': Similarly lax, Alderweireld gives the ball away to Giroud very deep in the half. Giroud crosses it first time to an open, late-arriving Matuidi, but the touch is lose and crosses the byline for a goal kick.

18': Great strike from Matuidi from outside the area--great technique and power--but the placement is off, right at the goalkeeper, and Courtois collects easily.

19': Hazard cuts inside on the left-wing, past the makeshift right-back Pavard, and his shot is headed onto the post by Varane. Another corner for Belgium.

21': A good delivery from a corner finds Fellaini inside the box. His touch kills it dead, laying it back for Alderweireld to strike. He goals for goal with his weak foot, right into the corner, but it's tipped aside by his club teammate Lloris.

23': A simple long ball comes to Giroud, but his touch isn't the required contact, and it sails harmlessly out.

28': Fellaini wins the ball back high up the pitch, gives the ball too Hazard, who creates some space and plays it out wide to de Bruyne. His whipped crosses is blocked just before Lukaku can tap it in. Yet another corner. Oly a matter of time before a delivery finds itself poked into the back of either net.

28': Giroud is fouled, resulting in the first free-kick of the game. Has been very open, as well as end-to-end.

31': Pavard, in acres of space, dinks a ball up to Giroud on the penalty spot. It's just behind him, so his header sends it wide. Decent effort.

31': Wicked feet from Hazard to make it past 3 players ear the touchline, but his last touch *just* sends it over the touchline.

33': Intricate work from Griezmann and Hernandez on the left side finds him with a little bit of space on the edge of the box. He cuts inside, shifting it nicely to open the shot up, but it's on his weak foot, and sails comfortably over.

34': Glorious chance for France goes begging. A beautiful ball over the top from Griezmann finds Mbappé, who cushions a pass on the volley into Giroud in the middle of the box. On the stretch, he hits it wide, and, all told, it's a poor miss. Probably should've anticipated the ball across better, but France are looking creative nonetheless.

37': Beautiful work at the back from France beats the Belgium press. Griezmann breaks, cutting through the heart of the Belgian midfield, but he delays a pass out to Matuidi, who then becomes offside, so takes the shot on himself. Dragged well wide.

38': Giroud takes a breather on the touchline after taking a hit, but it's just that: a breather to recover.

39': Mbappé slots a ball gently, with the outside of his right boot, through two Belgian defenders to find Pavard, who has an open shot at goal. His shot is decent, but it's much too low, and Courtois' ankle denies him. Best chance of the game, and France will be hoping it doesn't come back to haunt them.

42': De Bruyne comes in late on Hernández, sticking out a leg to trip him up. An unnecessary foul.

44': Pogba pulled down by Dembélé, just outside the area. In a dangerous area, but it'll take a fantastic strike to beat the tall Belgian wall, as well as the equally-huge goalkeeper.

44': The shot from Griezmann is slammed straight in the wall.

45+1': Beautiful delivery from de Bruyne on the right flank beats Umtiti, only taking a slight touch, and finding Lukaku in the area, only a few paces out. The big Belgian forward, who hasn't been involved too much yet in this knockout match, is taken by surprise that it beats theFrench centre-half, and it comes off of him, out for a goal-kick.

[](#icon-clock) **Half-Time:** [](#sprite6-p60) **0-0** [](#sprite6-p17) 

Despite being level at the half, the net yet to bulge for either team, the game has been very open, and balances on a knife edge going into the second period. It could really go either way, and both teams look very dangerous. Mbappé has been the shining light for France so far, and Kanté has been typically solid in the Blues' midfield.

---

45': [](#icon-clock) Belgium's turn for kick-off, shooting from left-to-right, and the second half gets underway. There's sure to be a goal, and you have to think that'll open the floodgates.

47': All starting from a beautiful cross-field ball from Alderweireld to switch the play, a spell of Belgian possession results in a cross from deep from the DM, Wistel. It finds the head of Lukaku, but the finish is poor, skimming off of the *top* of the number 9's head over the bar.

49': De Bruyne tries to slot Lukaku in, but it's interecepted by Umtiti. Belgium have started the second half very strongly.

51': [](#sprite6-p60) [](#icon-ball) **GOALLLL! France! Samuel Umtiti/Fellaini (OG). A beautiful corner delivery from Griezmann glances off the head of Umtiti at the near post. It brushes the head of Fellaini on the way, and slots into the far corner. [1]-0**

54': France have a free-kick in a dangerous area at the left corner of the area, but the floated cross is dealt with comfortably. It breaks to De Bruyne, and then to Hazard, who Hernández brings down to stop a counter. No card.

56': Calm and full of flair inside the box, Mbappé receives the ball, turns, and [*backheels* the ball to play in Giroud](https://www.clippituser.tv/c/pladdb). Giroud is 1-on-1 with Courtois, but the shot is well kept out.

60': [](#sprite6-p17) [](#icon-up) Dries Mertens [](#icon-down) Mousa Dembélé. First substitution of the game goes to the trailing team. De Bruyne drops deeper. *1/3*.

61': Early contribution from Mertens! Lukaku plays the ball to him down the right, and he hangs a ball up to the back post. It's headed away uncontested, but falls to de Bruyne on the edge of the box. He slices it, and it falls easily to Lloris to be collected.

63': [](#sprite6-p17) [](#icon-yellow) Hazard shown a card for bringing down Matuidi, taking one for the team to prevent a counter after de Bruyne gave the ball away too easily.

65': A peach of a cross from Mertens finds Fellaini on the penalty spot, who outmuscles his marker Pogba. His header is powerful, but the angle isn't quite right, and it slides past the near post, perhaps a yard wide.

67': Mbappé skips past the sliding challenge of de Bruyne on the right wing, opening u plenty of space for a France counter-attack, with Griezmann and Giroud bombing down the pitch with him. He chips a ball to Griezmman on the other side, who plays a sidefooted pass back to Giroud. From 18 yards, the striker flashes it well over the bar. France have been very creative and silky, but Giroud needs to put on his finishing boots if France want to widen the margin.

71': [](#sprite6-p17) [](#icon-yellow) Alderweireld clips Matuidi's ankles to avoid a footrace.

79': A neat one-two by Hazard and Lukaku results in Hazard being tripped up by Giroud just outside the box. Clear foul, but the referee waves play-on, denying Belgium a much-needed opportunity.

80': [](#sprite6-p17) [](#icon-up) Carrasco [](#icon-down) Fellaini. *2/3*.

84': [](#sprite6-p60) [](#icon-up) Nzonzi [](#icon-down) Giroud. Defensive substitution, France looking to shore up and protect their lead for the last 10 minutes. *1/3*.

85': Matuidi brought down yet again. 

86': [](#sprite6-p60) [](#icon-up) Tolisso [](#icon-down) Matuidi. He put in a good performance, and his fresh-legged replacement, who filled in for him in the previous game due to suspension, replaces him yet again. *2/3*.

87': [](#sprite6-p60) [](#icon-yellow) Kanté given a card for bringing down Eden Hazard, after being all over him before the final foul. 

88': The free-kick is much too far out for a direct shot, but the ball from De Bruyne is deep, and is fluffed before being cleared.

89': De Bruyne's next delivery is much more threatening, dropping at the back post for an uncontested Lukaku header. It passes in front of his forehead by a mere inch.

90+1': [](#sprite6-p17) [](#icon-up) Batshuayi [](#icon-down) Chadli. Offensive substitution, one final throw of the dice for Belgium. *3/3*.

90+2': [](#sprite6-p60) [](#icon-yellow) Mbappé awarded a yellow card for throwing the ball away.

90+3': Griezmann with a great opportunity, but his finish is tried, and saved.

90+4': [](#sprite6-p17) [](#icon-yellow) Vertonghen booked for flailing his arms at Mbappé by the touchline. Frustration coming through as the defeat looms.

90+6': Game ends after an almighty, and very scrappy, 6 minutes of injury time. France have booked their place in their 3rd World Cup Final! Now it's just time to see whether their competition for the gold will be Croatia or England.

Sexy Space Babes: Chapter Fifty Two,"As Jason viewed their approaching destination out of the window of the car, he could only conclude that once you’d seen one military base, you’d seen them all.

“Nervous?” Yaro asked from the driver’s seat.

He eyed the woman in her Marine fatigues. “Hardly. As I said last night, they’ll probably want me to run another dog and pony show.”

He’d been on-loan to the Interior for the last two months, so it only made sense that the military-proper would want their own slice of the ‘Hero of Gurathu’ pie.

“Dog and pony?” Yaro asked. “I assume that refers to something media related?”

He just nodded, reminding himself to try and cut down on the idioms in future. It wasn’t so much of a problem in regular conversation, but it would be an issue if he used something from Earth during a speech or interview.

Both of them pulled out their ID cards as they reached the gate, the Shil’vati Marine there gave them both a quick once-over before waving them through.

“That was odd,” Jason said as Yaro drove toward the nearest parking-spot.

“What was?”

He cocked his head. “She barely even glanced at me.”

“And that’s an issue?” Yaro snickered as she pulled into a parking spot. “Do you think perhaps your recent fame is getting to your head, Jason?”

He scowled at the grinning Rakiri as they clambered out of the car and into the tropical Shil’vati heat.

“I got stared at *before* I became middlingly famous,” he said with feigned pretentiousness. “It comes with the territory of being male and Human, as far as Shil’vati are concerned. Rakiri, too.”

Hell, most races, given that Humanity was the odd one out when it came to having an even number of males to females.

“Perhaps she was expecting you?” the Rakiri said as they started walking toward the nearby administrative building. “As you said, you are middlingly famous.”

He shrugged. He supposed it didn’t matter in the end. It was just a momentary curiosity.

Truth be told, what he was really curious about was why he and Yaro had been called to this meeting together. Both had gotten a nondescript message ordering them to report for duty at this base today.

Which was a little odd, given that while they’d both been on the Whisker’s crew, before it had been pulled apart and everyone had been reassigned – where, he didn’t know – they both undeniably existed in different worlds as far as their duties were concerned.

Sure, they were both Marines, but while Jason had spent the last month attending parties and generally schmoozing with the upper classes Yaro had been given little to do but attend debriefings on the events at Gurathu and busywork.

Something he knew was privately driving her up the wall. While he wouldn’t exactly call his lover ambitious, she did like for her work to actually have some value. She’d lamented to him more than once about her quiet envy of Kernathu, who seemed positively ecstatic that her work on Ares had been noticed, which in turn had landed her a place in the Aviary – as an Engineer – working on the trainee Exos there.

*If only we could all be like Tarcil,* he thought.

His diminutive male friend was just on leave, after what was by all accounts a thoroughly boring series of exploratory missions in the deep periphery.

“Privates Jason and Yaro,” he said as they reached the front desk. “We were told to report at this location for further orders?”

The male civilian sitting at the desk glanced up at him – again, that curious non-reaction -- before tapping away at his monitor.

“Ah yes,” he said softly. “Please take a seat here, and the Colonel will be with you shortly.”

Even as he thanked the man and turned to take his seat, he found his brain puzzling over what had just been said.

*Colonel?* He mouthed at Yaro as they sat down.

The woman shrugged, indicating she had no more idea as to what was going on there than he did.

Sure, the entire crew of the *Whisker* – Jason in particular – had met a number of high-ranking officers in the days after Hela’s arrest, but those had been at award ceremonies and the like. In the normal flow of things, Privates like Yaro and he were very much beneath the notice of higher-ranking officers. A situation that suited most enlisted right down to the ground.

As had become a habit in recent days, he felt his palms beginning to itch as he began to wonder if something… unfortunate was about to happen.

He had not forgotten about Hela’s family.

Nothing had come of it yet, but he sincerely doubted the powerful noble family would just forget his role in getting their daughter arrested and besmirching the family name.

Unfortunately, there wasn't much he could do about it beyond keeping his eyes open and enjoying the relative safety provided by his current fame for as long as he could.

Which was why he couldn’t help but wonder if this latest set of orders was them finally making their move? Content to attack him now that a lot of the initial furor of his popularity had died down?

A little paranoid perhaps, just from an unexpected meeting with someone who was a little higher ranking than expected, but given that he’d been assigned to the iceball that was Gurathu the last time he’d offended a lady of noble lineage, he thought the paranoia was well warranted.

“Privates, Jason and Yaro?”

He almost jumped at the unexpected voice, also nearly slapping off a salute, before he realized the speaker was a Sergeant. Which sent a shudder of dread through him. The Colonel was a possible distant threat, but the rage of a Sergeant mistaken as an officer was a danger that all low-ranked enlisted were all too familiar with.

“Sergeant,” he and Yaro both acknowledged standing up.

The woman – a Helkam, just like Scales had been – nodded and gestured for them to follow her.

“The Colonel is ready to see you now,” she said as she took off down the hall.

The pair were guided into an office, where a woman sat at a desk piled high with data-pads as she hastily typed away at the monitor in front of her.

She was a… he didn’t really know what she was.

Some kind of moth-person? Bat-person? Both?

Sure, most of her was covered up by the black Marine jumpsuit she was wearing, but there was no missing the white fluff poking out of a neckline that was unzipped just enough to allow for it.

Exposing a deep valley of pale cleavage beneath.

Which was all sorts of strange. Was she like Scales? Some kind of platypus-style, shark, lizard, dolphin… thing? Because, for what possible reason would a moth person have breasts?

When he got an opportunity, he really needed to look into the evolutionary patterns of the other races of the universe, because there was no way breasts on an insectoid person would be natural.

*Nor should her face have such a Human, almost elfin, appearance,* he noted. *The pitch black eyes are a bit creepy. Especially combined with that porcelain pale skin.*

The wings were definitely nice; poking out of holes in the back of her jumpsuit, they were a series of deep purples, whites and greens that had him wondering if perhaps he’d been off in assuming she was a moth rather than a butterfly?

*…Or is she a bat?*

It was only as Yaro discreetly elbowed him in the side that he realized he was staring. Quickly, he followed her in snapping off a salute.

“Privates, Yaro and Jason reporting ma’am,” Yaro said entirely professionally.

The only indication the woman gave that she’d heard them was the slightest twitching of the feathery-looking antennae that jutted out from her forehead.

“At ease,” the woman said without stopping in her typing or looking up from her screen.

Still, Jason nearly jolted at her voice. It was strange for sure, an almost musical, double-toned thing. That wasn’t what had made him jolt though. What he’d initially assumed to be the skin of her face was actually some kind of flexible segmented carapace that parted around her jaw line.

Revealing teeth. Lots of rows of needlelike razor-sharp teeth.

Yeah, that was a bit more… alien.

*Definitely insectoid,* he thought.

“Well, I imagine the pair of you are curious about why you’re here.” she said, placing two hands on the table.

Which was odd, because two hands were still typing. Because she had four arms. And a very impressive ability to multitask, apparently.

Neither Jason nor Yaro had been given leave to speak, , but they did stand a little straighter to show that they were listening and attentive.

“Feel free to speak freely here,” the Colonel said. “Given your new role, I imagine we’ll be working together often, and it does none of us any favors for you to be antennae-tied the whole time.”

Resisting the urge to cock an eyebrow in surprise, or glance at Yaro, Jason nonetheless relaxed slightly.

“Thank you ma-” he started to say, only to be cut off as the Colonel raised a hand to stop him.

“Let me reiterate that you are only to speak freely in here,” she said warningly, a strange inhuman chitter entering her tone. “Your new role may allow you certain freedoms denied other enlisted, but you are *still* enlisted and I expect you to act as such.”

He waited for just a moment to see if he would be interrupted again, stifling a little irritation as he did, before speaking again.

“Thank you, ma’am.” He glanced at Yaro. “But I think I speak for both of us when I say I have absolutely no idea what you’re talking about. What is this new role I’m apparently being placed into?”

And why did it apparently provide him freedoms denied the common soldier?

It was a little hard to read the moth-woman’s expressions given that her face was more akin to a solid mask than flesh and blood, but he did catch just a hint of surprise in the way her eyes contracted.

“You weren’t informed?”

Both he and Yaro shook their heads, causing the woman to curse in a language he could honestly say he’d never heard before. Truth be told, it was rather pleasant to the ears, despite the obvious content and context. Like the tinkling of bells.

“Interior cunts,” she hissed, her double-toned voice flaring. “Couldn’t follow proper procedure if it were strapped to their oversized purple asses.”

Jason politely declined to comment. Precisely because he’d developed much the same opinion in the incredibly short period of time in which he’d been seconded to Pernora. Certainly the woman *could* follow procedure, but did so only when it benefited her to. From what he’d seen, the organization as a whole seemed to regard rules as things that only applied to other people.

Finally the woman seemed to come to a decision. She stood up suddenly, wings flaring out slightly as she did. “Alright, you two follow me. You were going to get a tour of the place anyway, so I figure I might as well fill you in on everything that you should have been filled in on weeks ago.”

He and Yaro had to scramble to follow after the woman as she swept out of the office without another word.

“We, uh, appear not to have gotten your name, Colonel?” Yaro asked tentatively as they followed the woman out of the building.

“You should have. It was on the door, my desk and my jumpsuit,” she said without turning around. “Doesn’t matter. Shil’vati lack the vocal cords to say my actual name, and I doubt you two are any different.”

Jason glanced at Yaro, who shrugged in a way that said ‘she’s right.’

“I go by ‘Colonel Cleff’, both in person and on official documentation.” As the woman spoke, her lower set of arms tapped away at her data-pad, causing both Yaro and his own data-pads to ping simultaneously. “I’m also your new commanding officer. Please confirm the transfer on your own time.”

Both Jason and Yaro stopped to salute. “Reporting for duty, ma’am.”

The action caused Cleff to finally stop, turning around to give them both a wry look.

“Good,” she said. “It seems the fame hasn’t totally gone to your head.”

Jason frowned. Had she been testing him?

Scarily, the officer seemed to read his mind, as she grinned, displaying the rows of weapons she called teeth.

“Was that a test? Yes and no,” she shrugged with all four arms. “In the past I’ve had to work with some Noble girls who didn’t like being ordered around by an alien. I’ve found it’s easier to discover that fact sooner rather than later and nip it in the bud. With that in mind, I figured I’d pull the same test with you. You are, after all, a hot commodity right now.”

“Understandable, ma’am.” He nodded – grudgingly. “And in what way wasn’t that a test?”

She had said yes and no. It was a reasonable question.

The Colonel nodded. “At most, my species live to be about fifty. We have short lives and live like it. Because of that, some other species tend to find us a bit brusque. Lacking in niceties. Normally, I try and rein it in.”

She stopped to take a deep sniff of the tropical Shil air, seemingly reveling in it as her antennae twitched. “Now though? Now I’m in charge - and one of the benefits of rank is that I can act as I damn well please so long as none of my superiors are around.” She eyed him. “And where we’re headed, superiors will be few and far between.”

*Well, that sounds ominous,* he thought. He was about to ask for clarification – on a number of things – when he noticed something. *Were those… no, it couldn’t be?*

“Are those Humans?” Yaro asked the question he’d just been ruminating over.

The moth woman glanced casually to the side. “Yes.”

“So many,” Yaro breathed. “I thought it was military policy to spread races out, ma’am.”

The Colonel shrugged. “Normally it is. But I’m sure you're aware of the exceptions.”

Yaro’s ears twitched as her gaze returned to the colonel. “This is a color regiment, ma’am?

Jason glanced between the two women, as he had no idea what a color regiment was. Something his new commanding officer was quick to notice.

“You might want to fill your boyfriend in on what that means, Private Yaro.”

He stiffened a bit, a little offended at what calling him that implied, before he forcibly relaxed.

*She did say she was brusque*, he reminded himself. Have to remember that she’s an alien. *Alien in different ways to your regular aliens.*

And until he met another example of her race, he’d keep assuming that whatever oddities his new commander had, they were cultural.

Life was simpler that way.

Yaro looked at him, shifting a little uneasily. “Color regiments are more… cultural than military.” She paused. “It’s difficult to explain.”

The moth-woman made a scoffing sound, her upper arms crossed over her – unreasonably ample – chest, while her lower pair gesticulated. “What she’s trying to say is that they’re normally trophies. Parade pieces. Made up almost entirely of races the Imperium has annexed. The Rakiri Highlanders. The Helkem Desert Raiders. Thulusian Marines.” She grinned. “Actual Marines. With water and shit.”

Before Jason could comment on that, she continued.

“The Empress likes to parade them in front of her palace every now and then. Show off how many worlds and species the Imperium encompasses.”

Glancing at Yaro for confirmation, he could see from the bend of her ears that his lover didn’t quite appreciate the way their new CO had described it – but wasn’t quite able to argue. As a result of respect for their difference in rank, or as a result of there being some truth in the other woman’s statement, he didn’t know. He’d have to ask when they were away from the possibility of official censure.

“You said normally,” Jason ventured before Yaro said something perhaps unwise. “And if we’re supposed to be a regiment of Earth, ma’am, why are you-”

“Here? In charge? Not Human?” The moth woman cut him off.

He simply nodded.

“Well, it’s not going to be normal,” the insect woman said simply. “Because I have no intention of my first regimental command being a toothless trophy piece.”

She gestured to where a bundle of Human recruits in Marine jumpsuits were jogging around a track, a Shil’vati NCO hounding them with such force that he could hear her even over the sound of the base and the distance between them.

“Second.” Cleff raised a delicate chitin covered finger. “Imperial Officer training is a three year course. Most Humans attempting to go that route are only halfway through it, and even if they were finished, they’d just be junior-lieutenants. Hardly the ranks required to fill up an entire regiment’s officer corps.”

“We had officers on Earth, ma’am.” Jason tried to keep his voice as even as possible as he said, but even he could hear the hint of bitterness there. As evidenced by the way Yaro shuffled almost imperceptibly closer.

Fortunately, his CO chose not to comment. On either item.

Instead she answered his question with the frankness he was coming to expect from her. “And how many of those officers were alive when the Shil’vati were done? How many were willing to sign up with the military that defeated them, killed their friends, and then disbanded their armies?”

The moth-woman made a strange clicking sound. “More to the point, do the Shil seem big on acknowledging other ways of being and doing?” She shook her head. “No, in their eyes, if you didn’t do it the Imperial way, you didn’t do it.

She shook her head.

“So no, you aren’t likely to see a bunch of Human officers here. You’ve got a bunch of non-Shil’vati, like me, who are going to be here until your Human larval officers metamorphosize into the correct rank to lead something like this.”

Which would take years, he acknowledged. Also, did her race metamorphosize? Did they start as larvae?

*Then why does she have breasts!?* he couldn’t help but think. He knew it wasn’t relevant, but it really bugged him.

Deliberately turning away from that train of thought, he glanced over to where the Humans were still running around the track. Funnily enough, it seemed their NCO had fallen behind at some point in the last few minutes. Clearly she wasn’t as familiar with Humans as his own trainers had been by the end of his time in the Crucible.

“So where do I fit into all this?” he asked finally. “Ma’am.”

Once again, the moth-woman gave him that unnerving grin, before she pulled out something brass and shiny.

“You’re our new Champion, Human.” She flung it toward him, making him scramble to catch the tiny piece of metal. “My condolences.”

"Today is arguably the most important day in the history of my club, Villarreal. I wrote a piece about the president of Villarreal, and how it all came to be that Christmas of 1996. Enjoy! | Fernando Roig: 400k Euros and a lifetime of loving Villarreal.","I originally wrote this last year for my site--If you want to learn more about how it all came to be with Villarreal's president, read up!

 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

A wave of chance sweeps Vila-real.

The team of Villarreal and the town of Vila-real were little more than just another name on the list of many teams and towns that made up the Spanish Second Division. A charming team in a small town that every now and again made the news, if only casually. A well-played Spanish Cup leg against a First Division team. An anecdotal temporary first place in the Second Division. A player who looked good, to be inevitably poached in the summer by a better team, one higher-up in the ladder.

Villarreal’s club profile looked vastly different than the what one can see now: 

– Ticket holders: Approximately 3,000–roughly a seventh of 2021

– Club annual budget: 2 million Euro, about 2% of the current one

– Club valuation: Roughly 400,000 Euros. The club is now worth over 200 million.

The stadium was not La Ceramica; it was El Madrigal. The training facilities of Miralcamp and Pamesa, both based in Vila-real, flat out did not exist. When it rained, there was a need to find a pitch to train on, anywhere possible, ideally with a roof over it. 

Different times.

Pascual Font de Mora gave everything for this club, and in his infinite wisdom, realized new blood was needed–but the right kind. In stepping down, he went on a search for a leader who would care, who would put his own ambition, and sweat equity, into the club. 

That idea did not come to fruition right away, though. The truth is, a television network almost took ownership of the club. Grupo Zeta, a group that owned the national network Antena 3, was interested. Talks were advanced. Font de Mora was reluctanct to sell, as the group was not based in Vila-real, and it was important for the president and others to have an owner with a local presence.

Eventually, Grupo Zeta backed out of the offer, and left Villarreal in a situation where they had to restart the search to find the right person. Back to square one. 

It was Christmas, 1996. 

Through the months that followed, club man Jose Manuel Llaneza took notice of a businessman who lived in the same town he lived; a man with ownership experience in other sports, like basketball. He was the president of Pamesa Valencia in those times.

Fernando Roig was a man from a family with resources; a soccer family, too. His brother had just resigned the presidency of Valencia, one of two eternal rivals, but who in the 90s was nothing more than an annoying cousin Villarreal was jealous of. 

Fernando Roig welcomed the conversation. As he said years later, “I did not choose Villarreal. Villarreal signed me.”

A few months later, the businessman sat next to Pascual Font de Mora, and at a press conference at local restaurant Avenida 41, made the announcement: Roig was the new president. 

The amount? A little over 400,000 Euros, or 70 million “Pesetas,” Spain’s old currency, for exactly 78% of the stock of the club. 

Rivers of ink followed from the local press. What were Roig’s intentions with the club? Did he understand the long-term goals of the club? Was he willing to put his money where his mouth was and invest in the team?

Roig showed his intentions from day one. In the press conference, he stated he was “here not to create a boys’ club or steamroll other people in the organization.” He was there to “spend money in Villarreal Club de Futbol.”

Even though the initial response from the locals was mostly positive, Roig still had an important side to convince: the passionate, committed, vocal supporter groups, or “penyes,” from the region. They were not so sure about the new owner. 

Roig knew he needed to talk directly and openly to them, take the temperature in the room, and make sure that the supporter groups accepted his purchasing of the club. He put together a meeting with the main groups, and made his intentions, once again, clear as water: “I want to promote this club to the First Division within the next two seasons.” 

A lot of those groups were excited about Roig’s ambition, but also thought he was crazy. A team that had never been promoted could do so in two years, with a more than modest budget in the 90s, back when La Liga was without question becoming the top league in the continent, promoted?

Roig was wrong. The team would not be promoted in its second season. 

He did it in one year.

Roig’s ambition soaked through the town: over 5,000 supporters signed up for a season pass, and higher-caliber players joined the Yellow Submarine. Andres Palop, on loan from Valencia; Thomas Christiansen, ex-Barcelona and a Spanish international; Alberto Saavedra and others ended up in Vila-real and under the management of Jose Antonio Irulegui, who remained in the bench from the previous season. The team managed the impossible and got promoted after a magical night in Compostela. 

Llaneza, years later, admitted that “Without Roig, Villarreal would not be in the First Division.” Andres Palop, the very first La Liga star goalkeeper in Villarreal, remembers how committed the president always was. “From day one, his ambition was contagious. He was always looking out for us, too. If it rained, he would be the first one to go out and find us a place to train indoors until the training facilities were built. He always had advice for us.”

His eye for business and his love for soccer married in Vila-real, and created a partnership that lasts to this day. Roig knows he is human, and understands making mistakes is part of being a leader. “A good club owner is one who makes good decisions most of the time, and when he makes a bad decision, is able to look back and learn from it.”

He also understands that as an owner, it is good when local competition does well, too. In a local interview in 2007, he spoke of the “Importance for local teams around Villarreal to be as high-up in the ladder as possible. The better Castellon, Valencia, Villarreal are doing, the better for the Valencian Community at large.”

In his 24 years in charge, players, staff and fans have spoken on endless occasions about the impact Fernando Roig had in Villarreal. He both exemplifies the passion and ambition of a local club to do well, but do well by doing the right things. Players took notice, and after key players in the first La Liga season like Victor Fernandez, Gica Craioveanu or Andres Palop himself, others followed. 

Marcos Senna, the club’s current ambassador, is probably the biggest advocate for what good management can do to weigh in on a player’s decision to sign. “Llaneza came to Brazil, and convinced me to sign. I met Roig for the first time at my presentation in Vila-real. He was very warm, always joking and talkative. He was one of us.”

“They have treated me so well,” stated the Spanish-Brazilian ex-player to Mediterraneo a few years back. “In Brazil, it would be impossible for me to have a gate named after me. That gesture is forever.”

“Everything he has planned, he has achieved,” 

What he planned, and his impact in Villarreal is not up for debate: Three promotions. A second place finish in La Liga. A remodeled stadium, La Ceramica, with capacity for over 23,000 fans. Five European semifinals, including the famous Champions League battle against Arsenal in 2006. Two brand new, top of the line training facilities.

The beautification of the neighborhood surrounding La Ceramica, and the construction of a square next to the stadium in honor of Pascual Font de Mora. In the plans, a high-standing restaurant inside of La Ceramica, and a museum about the history of the club. 

As Roig himself puts it, “It is nice to look back, but the important thing is to look at the next 20 years. They will be better, and more important, than what is behind us.” 

In that trajectory he was aiming for, Roig enjoyed the final he has been looking for since May 15, 1997. And a European final, no less. Villarreal ended up lifting the trophy against all odds. 

Twelve months later, here we are again. The big stage. A team that is surely going to bend the knee against mighty Liverpool, and one very few give any options to go through, regardless of having taken care of Bayern Munich and Juventus already. Liverpool is its biggest test; ;but Roig, Emery, and Villarreal are playing the match of their lives.

If previous behavior is an indicator of what’s to come for Villarreal after whatever happens this month, all we need to do is look back at his comments after his first relegation from La Liga, and his intentions to come back again, as soon as possible. After Roig gets to a landmark for the club, he moves the goalpost and asks for more. 

“When one has tried Jamon Iberico, the Serrano one tastes dull.”

"My daughter kept a shoebox under her bed, filled with cocoons she found in the woods. I thought they were insects. I was wrong.","My daughter Hannah had always had a fascination with bugs of all kinds. She collected them and kept them in a terrarium she insisted I buy for her when she was six. It was on a constant rotation as her interests changed; when she was younger, it was ladybugs and caterpillars. Now that she was a teenager, she got into more unusual things, like mantises and stick insects. Much of the time, I thought she related better to them than she did to me and her friends at school. Not that she had many of them, but she was never bullied; she just kept to herself. That's probably my doing, though; my wife and unborn son were both lost in childbirth, and when I adopted Hannah, I never really tried giving her anything girly to do. So, her going out and doing things in the woods and collecting bugs never struck me as odd.

What did strike me as odd was her terrarium was currently empty; I found the shoebox and asked her about it, and all she said was that she was working on a project. And as she reminded me, they don't have cocoons, they have “ootheca.” It was something that kind of looked like a cocoon, but sounded more like a Dr. Seuss creation than a real thing. Still, of all the bugs she found, mantises were the most interesting to me; the way they stood, with those close in the air. Hannah and I watched one on the front porch once, stock still, just waiting for something to walk by. She said they ate other bugs, and sometimes each other. I asked why they ate each other. Without missing a beat, she said that sometimes, the larger females would eat the smaller males after mating, or if unlucky, sometimes before, leaving nothing but wings and a few legs behind.

That was around the time I stopped asking her questions about insects.

Despite how odd the shoebox was, I put it out of my mind, because what was most important to me was the annual town chili cook-off. To close out the summer, our little town put on a big fall festival, and besides cider, donuts, and local bands who couldn't make it big anywhere else, we had a chili cook-off. I knew this year was my chance to win something. I had never placed, but this year I had a recipe I was sure was going to make everyone stand up and take notice. I especially wanted to beat out Harris Bolls, if nothing else. Harris usually won first place, but got dethroned last year, and had spent the better part of the year telling the winner, Ellie Hopkins, that she cheated every chance he got. He tried to pass it off as joking, but everyone knew he was just being bitter and an ass about it.

As I worked on my recipe in secret every night, perfecting the recipe wherever I could, life in the house went on as usual, with Hannah taking her little trips out the woods to collect and catalog all her little specimens. Thing is, she would come in fairly late at night, mostly around dinner time, and except for the shoebox, I didn't see her doing much of anything else.

I wasn't completely stupid; I felt like there was more to it than she was letting on, but hey, at least studying bugs was a better hobby than smoking weed and skateboarding around town like most of the teenagers around here did. But I couldn't help the feeling that she had found someone, and just didn't want me to know who it was. She probably would think I didn't approve, but hanging out with anyone was a step up in my book.

On the day of the festival, I was sure my recipe was going to be a winner. Harris would never even know what hit him. I got up around the crack of dawn, only to find Hannah was already up. Now that was certainly strange; she barely woke up at all unless I went in to get her. Still with that shoebox at her side.

“Hey, Dad, just wanted to tell you your chili tastes great. You should make sure you have some later.”

I was flattered that she even cared. But, despite her kind words, I had tried so much of my own chili trying to get it ready that, to be honest, I was kind of sick of eating the stuff. I didn't say that to her, but I did thank her. Amazingly, she wanted me to give her a ride to the festival, when I didn't even know she had planned go. I was so happy, I didn't even remember to buckle my seatbelt on the way there.

I was actually one of the earliest, as more and more shuffled into the tent. Harris and Ellie were actually among the last to arrive, and gave each other dirty looks as they set up on opposite sides of the tent. I was just happy to see Hannah come in right when the tent opened.

She came by, smiling, and said, “I think the competition is going to be really fun this year. I'm really hoping you win.” With the shoebox still under her arm, she started going to all the other tables. I hoped she wouldn't ruin her dinner trying absolutely everybody's, but again, just the fact that she was here made me feel on the top of my game.

As the day wore on, I could swear most of the town came through. Most of them complimented my chili, but when the judges came by, they all wore their best stone faces. I couldn't tell where I stood, but I crossed my fingers and hoped for the best. I just hoped that nobody cared that I went and got a couple of hot dogs from one of the food trucks outside for lunch. They were some kind of teriyaki/Korean barbecue-style things. Really wish I had thought of those; they were pretty good.

Finally, the time came when the judges reached their decision. Near the entrance flap, the judges stood up, and announced third place: Ellie Hopkins. There was a nice round of applause, and she took the award with a smile.

Then second place: Me. More applause, and I raised my arms in triumph. Sadly, though, even as I grinned and accepted my little silver cup, I felt a twinge as I could guess who the first place winner was.

I was right. Harris had claimed his crown once again. He acted as you might have expected a five-time champion with no sense of class would act, yelling like he was so surprised that it had happened and high-fiving everyone, even if they didn't have their hands up. He took his gold trophy, cleared his throat, and began delivering his victory speech, which sounded like he had been practicing the night before.

He got three lines in when he cleared his throat again. He got one more line before he gave a horrendous cough, and then made a sound like his chili was coming up again.

It would've been hilarious, if everyone in the tent, other than myself, hadn't started doing the same thing.

Harris clutched at his throat and retched one last time, and this time I could see his throat had something terribly wrong with it. It was swollen, and reddening with each passing second. His whole face was turning bright red, in fact.

I looked around for help, but the EMTs on hand in the tent were also grabbing at their throats and falling to the ground.

I ran to Harris and, assuming he was choking, got in place to give him the Heimlich. I gave one quick thrust.

It was the worst thing I could have done. In that moment, I felt something underneath Harris' skin, at his stomach, squirming and wriggling, and when I applied that pressure, it made it all press up and out.

Something greenish fell from his mouth in a wave, and then his nose, and then his throat. It split open like a sausage that had been squeezed. The greenish wave, I saw, started writhing on the ground in a thick mass. I stepped away from Harris as his body fell to the ground, as more and more of those green things emerged from his throat and his mouth, and then, to my growing horror, his eyes.

I looked around the tent and saw that the same thing was happening to everyone else there; green insects forcing their way out of every hole imaginable, and when they couldn't do that, made their own way out. Soon everything in the tent was covered in them.

Covered in small praying mantises. And then they started to feed on everyone they had landed on. If they hadn't pushed their way out of the eyes already, that was what they went for first.

They even started coming for me. Some landed on my bare arms and started biting. I brushed them off, and heard crunching underfoot as I ran over and stomped as many as I could, escaping the den of horrors.

I ran from the tent and out into the open festival, gagging and wishing I had eaten something so I could throw up, but instead I saw people screaming as several people out in the festival were covered in mantises as well.

I looked for Hannah, remembering how she had been in the tent so early. I wanted to make sure she was okay. But I couldn't find her. Even as more and more people started coughing up the little mantises, she wasn't anywhere to be found. I tried calling her on her phone. No answer.

I then heard a strange, far off noise. It was a high-pitched whistling, like an emergency broadcast made with a defective dog whistle. A loud hum came from all around me, and I had to duck as every mantis in the place swarmed out of the tent and away from the fallen bodies. They scratched me as they passed, and then, suddenly, they were gone. I got up and saw the insect cloud flying off to the west.

I didn't wait around. I ran as fast as I could to my car, to chase the cloud. I didn't know what I thought I would do, having gotten such a late start trying to catch it, but I finally saw where it started to dissipate. I pulled my car up in my driveway as I saw the last hints of the cloud vanishing into the woods behind my house.

Weeks later, when the police sent me video someone had on their phone, catching Hannah pulling something from her shoebox and dropping it into a pot of chili in the cook-off, I can now say I was not surprised. I also wasn't surprised when a noted entomologist stated that these things weren't pure mantises, because mantis nymphs can't fly. I can also say they'll never catch Hannah. Because what I found in those woods, I haven't revealed to anyone, until now.

In the woods, I came to a clearing. A few mantises were still fluttering around there, but thankfully they ignored me. I saw things carved into the trees. Some of them looked years old. There were weird shapes, like a hieroglyphic language, as well as images of an insect. It vaguely resembled a mantis, but I could see digits, like fingers. When I could see words I could read, I kept seeing the phrase “He Who Preys” written all over. It looked this thing was worshipped, like a god, or a leader. All of it was in Hannah’s handwriting. There were other phrases, too... “Coming of Age” came up a lot, as was “The Return.”

And then I saw a trail leading into the woods.

I followed discarded clothing. I picked them up. It was the clothes Hannah had been wearing that day.

They led to a large, brown, shape, attached to a tree. It looked like a sleeping bag, but larger, with a large hole in the middle, like it had split on the inside. Something ichorous dripped from it.

But there was something else inside. Something brittle. I pulled it out.

A skin. A shed skin, like a snake. But not a snake.

A human skin.

Hannah.

But there was more.

I followed a trail of strange footprints to another small clearing. And that was when I went to go get a lighter and some gasoline, to destroy everything in those unholy abominations of those clearings.

In that clearing was the largest set of wings I had ever seen. Along with several pairs of unnaturally large insect legs.

[](#icon-info-big) **MATCH EVENTS:**

**Pre-Match**

-75' - Lineups announced.

-15' - Hello and welcome to the second quarter final of the World Cup as five time world champions and tournament favourites Brazil take on free scoring Belgium. The winner of this match will set up a semi-final tie with France. Brazil have lived up to their tag of tournament favourites and have looked the most convincing team in the tournament even as other favourites fell by the wayside. Belgium on the other hand, despite being the highest scoring team, needed a last minute goal to win their last 16 match against Japan. 

-10' - Both teams are assembled in the tunnel. 

-6' - The teams exit the tunnel and enter the field. 

-5' - The national anthems are played, with the Brazilian national anthem first, followed by the Belgian one.

-1' - Players from both teams intermingle and stand in front of a ""Say no to racism"" banner. 

**First Half**

**1'** - [](#icon-whistle) Kickoff! Both teams in their home colours, Brazil in yellow and Belgium in red. 

**2'** - De Bruyne gets a shot away from over 30 yards, but it sails harmlessly wide.

**3'** - Neymar moves down the left channel and crosses in to the Belgium box, where it's gathered safely by Courtois.

**6'** - Only took 6 minutes for Neymar to end up on the floor. Not expecting this to be the last time we see that sight in this match.

**8'** - A Brazil corner is flicked off the head of Miranda and onto the feet of Thiago Silva two yards from goal, however he doesn't get a clean contact and it lobs onto the post! Belgium than get going down the other end, with Hazard getting a shot blocked. 

**10'** - Another Brazil corner finds Paulinho unmarked in the box, only for him to fluff his kick.

**13'** - [](#sprite6-p17) [](#icon-ball) [**GOOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLL!!!! BELGIUM!!!!!** And after Brazil's missed opportunities from their corners, Belgium score off one! Hazard's corner is flicked on by Kompany and hits the elbow of Fernandinho to leave Alisson wrong footed!](https://streamja.com/jegX)

**15'** - Brazil look for an instant response and almost get one!

**21'** - Hazard cuts in from the left and slips in a pass to an unmarked Meunier. He tries to find Lukaku inside the box but his cross is cleared by Miranda.

**26'** - A mishit cross by Marcelo heads straight towards the Belgium goal and has to be palmed away to safety by Courtois.

**28'** - Brazil are currently playing with 10 as Neymar is receiving treatment on the touchline.

**31'** - [](#sprite6-p17) [](#icon-ball) [**GOOOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLL!!!! BELGIUM!!!!!** A Brazil corner gets cleared by Fellaini and the ball falls to the feet of Lukaku. He holds the ball up, then turns and runs at the Brazil defence, slipping past three defenders before sliding in a pass to De Bruyne to his right. De Bruyne shoots from the edge of the area and finds the bottom left corner, leaving Alisson with no chance!](https://www.clippituser.tv/c/kaqzan)

**36'** - Jesus receives a cross unmarked in the box but heads wide. 

**37'** - [Courtois makes two saves in quick succession! First off a deflected cross from Marcelo, and then off a long shot from Coutinho after the resulting corner was played short.](https://www.clippituser.tv/c/mqndqp)

**41'** - [De Bruyne shoots at goal from a free kick at an angle wide left and it has to be tipped over by Alisson. Kompany gets on to the end of the resulting corner and backheels a shot on target, however it is straight into the hands of Alisson.](https://streamable.com/tf359)

**44'** - [Neymar goes down inside of the box after contact with Meunier, the referee is not interested and waves away his protests.](https://www.clippituser.tv/c/wxpqpp)

**45'** - There will be 1 minute of added time.

**51'** - Marcelo whips in a cross from the left byline, it sails past Firmino's outstretched boot. 

**53'** - [Neymar goes down in the Belgium box again, and is told to get up by the referee. Replays show it was a clear dive and Neymar is lucky not to get booked.](https://www.clippituser.tv/c/rykekg)

**55'** - Paulinho, from an angle wide right, muscles his way past two Belgian defenders and gets a shot away, but it's saved by Courtois.

**56'** - [Brazil come again, with Jesus nutmegging Vertonghen from the right byline, and he then goes down after a sliding tackle from Kompany!

**61'** - Belgium counter again, with Chadli and De Bruyne combining to find Hazard in space on the left. Hazard goes for goal and shot sails just past the far post. 

**62'** - Douglas Costa's shot is saved by Courtois and it falls right into the path of Paulinho, however he doesn't expect it and the ball deflects away from goal off his boot. 

**65'** - Neymar gets fouled by Alderweireld, he doesn't bring out any of his playacting antics this time due to the match situation. 

**71'** - [](#sprite6-p17) [](#icon-yellow) Meunier gets a yellow for hacking down Neymar. He will miss the semi-finals if Belgium qualify. 

**73'** - [](#sprite6-p24) [](#icon-sub) Paulinho [](#icon-down) Renato Augusto [](#icon-up)

**75'** - Douglas Costa runs down the right and gets a shot away, but it's saved by Courtois. The rebound falls to Neymar, and his shot is blocked.

[**GOOOOOOOOLLLLL!!!! BRAZIL!!!!!** Coutinho whips in a cross and an unmarked Renato Augusto heads it past Courtois and into the bottom corner.](https://www.clippituser.tv/c/vxbnya)

**78'** - Neymar's pass from the left finds Firmino inside the box. Under pressure from Kompany and being closed down by other Belgium players, he twists and turns before getting a shot away but it sails over. 

**81'** - Renato Augusto finds himself in space again, but shoots wide from the edge of the box. 

**83'** - [](#sprite6-p17) [](#icon-sub) Nacer Chadli [](#icon-down) Thomas Vermaelen [](#icon-up)

**84'** - [Firmino finds Neymar in space down the left flank, and the latter slides in a pass to Coutinho who is in a great position but completely miscues his shot and it ends up high, wide and nowhere near the back of the net.](https://streamable.com/xrr5a)

**85'** - [](#sprite6-p24) [](#icon-yellow) Fernandinho brings down Hazard as the latter went past him and becomes the first Brazilian player in the book.

**87'** - [](#sprite6-p17) [](#icon-sub) Romelu Lukaku [](#icon-down) Youri Tielemans [](#icon-up)

**90'** - The fourth official displays the board which shows 5 minutes of added time. 

**90'** - [](#sprite6-p24) [](#icon-yellow) Fagner takes Hazard down to stop a Belgium counter and gets booked.

**90+1'** - [Neymar goes down while trying to get on the end of a cross from Fagner. Once again he appeals for a pen, and once again the ref ignores his protests.](https://streamja.com/29k6)

**90+4'** - [Douglas Costa and Neymar combine to find the latter in space on the edge of the box. He curls one which was headed towards the top corner, but Courtois saves it with his fingertips! The resulting corner is headed over by Firmino.](https://www.clippituser.tv/c/zkexle)

**90+5'** - [](#icon-whistle) **Full time: Brazil 1-2 Belgium.** Belgium have done it! They have knocked out Brazil and will play France in the semi-final. Brazil threw everything at Belgium in the second half and pulled a goal back, but some mediocre finishing and Courtois's brilliance in goal prevented them from getting level.

##[](#icon-discuss-big) **MATCH EVENTS**  
  
-30': *This is it, the great final between the two superpowers is going to start in 30'! Brazil vs. Argentina! Neymar vs. Messi fighting for their first Copa America! Will Argentina do the impossible? Lets hope that at least they're close and they gave us a clásico to remember!!!*  
  
-25': *[Life is life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7ZjU-6iSwk&ab_channel=Maradonainedito-Canal2.0) sounds as both teams heat-up. It truly has to be that one right? Lets hope that D10S is watching this wherever he is.*   
  
-15': *Tite plays the expected XI, but Scaloni has done 5 subs from the last match, and most are pretty controversial. Molina was playing well so even if Montiel has a higher status the change is confusing. Everything indicates that Cuti Romero will play this match injured/with injections, so his inclusion is a bet. Acuña over Tagliafico is a dangerous bet too, as the later was far better defending and Di Maria, the other inclusion in the same wing, is 35 years old and doesn't tracks back as much anymore.*  
  
-10': *Supposedly there should be 8.000 spectators on Maracaná right now, but you hardly see any. But well, it is a pretty big stadium after all, the most legendary of this side of the world, and one that has seen Brazil's most precious memories... but also the hardest one. Uruguay won the World Cup final here against the extremely-favourite locals in 1950, the most shocking result in a World final. Now Brazil comes with a similar status, could the impossible repeat?*  
  
-7': *Lots of lasers, fireworks, music and even some cartoons (?) as Gente de Zona's la Gozadera sounds in the background. I can't decide if it is great or cringe.*  
  
-5': *And here are the anthems!*    
  
-2': *The official pictures, Messi and Thiago Silva salute each other (not a truly affectionate one), a minute of silence for the COVID victims and medical staff... and here we go!*   
  
-----  
  
1': Brazil's starts attacking at the right, with a long ball that goes through Argentina's defensive line and Richarlison almost catches before Otamendi sends it away. No foul.  
  
3': [](#sprite6-p24)[](#icon-yellow) Two fouls already, one by Otamendi, and now a yellow card on Fred after an ugly tackle on Montiel. Deserved.  
  
6': Cautious match so far. Argentina tried at the right but not even Messi could break through. Now it tried at left and almost did it but ended in a foul by the attacker. [""Calma""](https://i.gifer.com/2xOS.gif) says Tite from the bench.
  
8': Messi fouls Paquetá in the middle of the pitch. Ostojich is being extremely strict this match.  
  
11': We reach the first ten minutes and no shot so far. The match is fought in the middle and both defensive lines are cautious. Ugly foul of Lodi against Romero btw.  
  
14': Now an ugly foul on Paquetá while Neymar shows that somebody cut his shorts lol.  
  
15': Tackle after tackle after tackle. Now Montiel vs. Casemiro vs. Messi. Btw, I feel Argentina is playing with a 4-4-2 instead of the predicted 4-3-3. 
  
16: Both Messi and Neymar on the floor right now. Peak CONMEBOL, even Colombia-Argentina was a more fluid match haha  
  
20': First ""shot"" of the match. Richarlison gifts Neymar the ball after a great long pass, but it rebounds in a defender before going easily to Emi Martinez's hands.    
  
22': **EL FIDEOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO**   
  
23': [](#sprite6-p7)[](#icon-ball) [**TREMENDOUS LONG PASS FROM DE PAUL THAT DI MARIA IS ABLE TO RECEIVE WELL AND FINISH WITH A BEAUTY OVER EDERSON. COULD THE IMPOSSIBLE HAPPEN? BRAZIL 0-1 ARGENTINA!!!**](https://streamwo.com/2Tkk9c3)  
  
26': Second shot of the match, Casemiro now tries from Uruguay and goes easily into Martinez. Anyway, what a goal by Fideo. Fun fact: he also scored with a ""globito"" like this one in the 2008 Olympics final... and Argentina won.  
  
29': UFFF, Di Maria is on fire, he is toying with Lodi right now. Long shot whose rebound Lautaro almost catches before the Brazilian defense.  
  
33': [](#sprite6-p7)[](#icon-yellow) Yellow card for Paredes after a dangerous tackle on Neymar... and also because of plenty of fouls before this one.  
  
34': Neymar's free kick goes to the wall. The Peruvian defense of yesterday could learn one or two things about it.  
  
37': OH NO FIDEO, NOT AGAIN.  
  
38': [](#sprite6-p7)[](#icon-red-cross) Like in 2014 and 2015, Di Maria is injured, he did to himself without intervention of the Brazilian defense. Argentina with 10 players right now.   
  
40': Brazil is clueless right now. It tries to play in the middle but the 4-4-2 of Argentina is extremely well synchonized, so long ball it is, but they haven't been lucky so far. And it doesn't help that even Richardlison is down defending. Also good news, Di Maria is back! lets hope it wasn't serious.  
  
42': Great cross from Paquetá that Montiel is forced to send to the corner. The first one of the match!  
  
43': UFFF, Marquinhos is able to head the ball and it goes through Argentina's small box like a hot knife on butter, but at the end it finds no attackers and goes wide. Argentina breathes again.  
  
45'+1: END OF THE FIRST HALF!  
  
-----  
  
**HT: An extremely physical match that hasn't let Neymar nor Messi highlight, but that is being decided by a beauty by Di Maria (and tbf, a collective brainfart by the Brazilian defenders). But well, everything still can happen, especially between such bitter rivals with so many individual stars.**   
  
**Anyway, here is** [**Messi's Reggae**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S996oLGwuU)   
   
-----  
  
46': And the second half starts! will Argentina do another Maracanazo and the Scaloneta become the new dominant tactic of South American football? lets wait and see!  
  
47': Firmino in for Brazil, Fred out.  

49': Richarlison dives near Argentina's box, no foul.  
  
51': [](#sprite6-p7)[](#icon-yellow) Yellow for lo Celso after a tackle on Neymar in the middle of the pitch, but that stopped a counter.  
  
53': [](#sprite6-p24)[](#icon-flag) UFFFFF, Richarlison scores after a disasterclass of the Argentinian defense, but luckily it was clearly offside.  
  
54': Paredes out for Argentina, Guido Rodriguez (a #6) in.  
  
55': UFFF AGAIN, great save from Emi Martinez after a strong shot by Richarlison that is doing what he wants on the right wing. Argentina is getting flooded over there, maybe Taglafico should get in.  
  
56': AGAIN, and Neymar cries for a penalty, but everything was offside so Argentina is saved.   
  
59': Even if Argentina has been able to breath these last minutes Brazil is clearly superior. Will the Scaloneta resist? Messi, Fideo and Lautaro haven't been named in a while.  
  
62': Welp, there is Messi, losing the ball in a atypical way for him. Meanwhile, for some reason Bella Ciao sounds in the background of the stadium.  
  
63': Wtf Thiago Silva, gifted a corner to Argentina in a completely stupid way.  
  
64': WAS THAT A PENALTY? Messi goes down in the box after hitting the lef of a Brazilian defender, but the Uruguayan referee isn't impressed. If he was Sterling that would have been one tbh.     
  
67': [](#sprite6-p7)[](#icon-yellow) Yellow card for de Paul after stopping a Neymar counter... just like the other two Argentinian yellows lol.   
  
70': [](#sprite6-p24)[](#icon-yellow) Now yellow card for Lodi after fouling de Paul. Piñas van, Piñas vienen.  
  
72': Gabigol and Emerson on the line. Both are coming in apparently. Also yellow card for Paqueta after a foul on Tagliafico.  
  
76': Here they come, Emerson for Lodi and Gabigol for Paquetá! Brazil goes all-in for the last 15'!  
  
78': IS THAT A PENALTY? Gabigol goes down in the box but the referee says play on.   
  
80': Three changes for Argentina, Cuti Romero, Fideo and Lautaro out, Pezzella, Nico Gonzalez and Exequiel Palacios in.  
  
81': [](#sprite6-p7)[](#icon-yellow) Jesus, I almost feel pity for Neymar. Otamendi runs and clash into him at full speed. Yellow card and almost a fight.  
  
83': PEZELLA BLOCKS A BRAZIL SHOT IN EXTREMIS, SCREAMS IN BUENOS AIRES.  
  
85': Tremendous pass by Casemiro that Otamendi barely reaches before Neymar. Argentina is surrounded. Oh, and there was a yellow for Marquinhos for hitting Otamendi.   
  
88': EMI MARTINEZ! SAVE IN EXTREMIS BY THE ARGENTINIAN KEEPER AFTER MADNESS IN HIS BOX.   
  
89': EIBARMAN, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!?!?!?!  
  
89': Unbelievable what Messi just missed. Started the play as Maradona in Italy 90 and ended slipping like Gerrard in Ederson's small box. Come on Lionel, that was your goal!!!   
   
90': What the hell, is that Montiel? anyway, some player's leg is full of blood, and I'm not exaggerating. There will be 5 minutes more!
  
90'+2: Handball by Firmino, terrible match by him so far.  
  
90'+3: WHAT A MINUTE, first Argentina almost scores but Ederson saves de Paul's shot in extremis and now Neymar dribbles between 3 defenders as if they were kids!    
  
90'+5: just 30'' more, the Argentinians chants are all over Maracaná!!!  
  
##FT: IT IS OVER, ARGENTINA ARE CHAMPIONS AFTER 27 YEARS!!! THE YEARS OF HURT ARE OVER!!! BRAZIL HAS SUFFERED A NEW MARACANAZO!!!

**Preview:**

[Belgium's pre-match Press Conference, featuring Martinez and de Bruyne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdwNQ6U1ilQ) (29:45)

[The best highlights from the quarter-final stage.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXuP661DSCo) (2:42)

[Tifo Football's tactical preview:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqnmSIWTjg) (4:14)

France have conceded only three goals on the way to the semi-finals, and the central defensive pair snuffed out the attacking threat of Luis Suarez in the quarter-final against Uruguay, barely allowing him a touch in the penalty area. A very different threat approaches in Lukaku, who has scored 4 goals in 4, only 2 behind Golden Boot leader Harry Kane. The Belgian forward will no doubt be eager to stake a claim on the award with a few goals in this game.

France and Belgium have a long history, facing each other 73 times in total. France have won 24 of the meetings, with Belgium taking 30 victories, leaving 19 draws between them.

The last time France and Belgium played each other, however, was on 7 June 2015 at the Stade de France outside Paris. At that time in 2015, Samuel Umtiti, Benjamin Pavard, Lucas Hernandez, Corentin Tolisso, Ousmane Dembele and Kylian Mbappe had yet to earn their first French cap.

None of the four semi-finalists from the 2014 World Cup have made it to this stage this time around, in part thanks to these two teams; France defeated Argentina in the 'Round of 16', in a thrilling 4-3 game, and [Belgium scraped by Brazil in the last round](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8IK0ZqfxNI), winning 2-1 after an early Fernandinho own-goal, as well as a rocket from de Bruyne.

""We are on an equal footing with France,"" said Kevin De Bruyne, who scored the [crucial second goal](https://www.clippituser.tv/c/kaqzan), which just so happened to be the winning goal, in Belgium's quarter-final win over Brazil. ""We will try and do everything we can physically and mentally. That's all we can do. At the end, you do all you can to win and if they're better, they're better. That's football.""

Roberto Martinez's side are the tournament's top scorers so far, with 14 goals. The last team to have scored that many goals prior to the semi-final stage was Brazil in 2002...and of course they went on to become champions that year. A good omen for Belgium? 

With heaps of talent on both sides of the pitch, the game will come down to tactics and mentality as well as raw talent, which both teams have in abundance. France coach, Didier Deschamps, has led the national team in over 3x more international matches than his counterpart, Martinez. Deschamps being their longest-standing manager ever, Les Bleus have won 51 games, drawn 15, and lost 15 under his tutelage, including a loss in the final at Euro 2016, whilst Belgium under Martinez have an astounding record of 19 wins, 5 draws, and 1 loss since he took over in August of 2016. A 63% vs 76% win rate, albeit over different scales.

Regardless of result, a European team will win the World Cup this year. So much for *World* Cup ^/s. Having both secured their seats at the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia table until next weekend's fight for medals, France and Belgium now have to see who will be pursuing gold and who is left searching for bronze. A potentially career-crowning final is as little as an hour and a half of football away.

0': [](#icon-whistle) The referee blows, and France get the first Semi-Final underway!

1': Before Belgium even manage a touch, Mbappé does well with the ball on the right-side of the pitch, crosses the ball low, but it's intercepted. Early signs of attacking intent from the French side.

3': Quick break from Belgium finds Chadli on the wing with plenty of space, but he crosses early, and it's blocked for a throw in.

6': Hazard knocks the ball past Pavard, cutting it back on his left foot. It's put behind by Umtiti, but only just flashes past the post for a corner. 

7': The resultant corner from Chadli is poor, and the ball sails over the heads of everyone in the box and out for a goal kick.

10': France's first 'chance' since the very start of the game comes from a long ball up to Giroud, who knocks it back down. The ball is chipped over the Belgian defence to Mbappé. Being too far ahead of him, his outstretched boot can only get a slight touch on it, sending it just behind Giroud.

13': Great feet from Pogba to dance past Dembélé, before passing the ball down the field to a sprinting Mbappé. The pitch being thoroughly watered before kick-off means that it zips across the field, just ahead of the young French striker and into the gloves of Courtois, who comes off his line quickly.

16': France being sloppy in possession at the back means the ball falls to Kevin de Bruyne just outside the area. He puts a fantastic touch on the volley to send it past the defender to Eden Hazard. Hazard's low shot flashes just past the far post.

16': Similarly lax, Alderweireld gives the ball away to Giroud very deep in the half. Giroud crosses it first time to an open, late-arriving Matuidi, but the touch is lose and crosses the byline for a goal kick.

18': Great strike from Matuidi from outside the area--great technique and power--but the placement is off, right at the goalkeeper, and Courtois collects easily.

19': Hazard cuts inside on the left-wing, past the makeshift right-back Pavard, and his shot is headed onto the post by Varane. Another corner for Belgium.

21': A good delivery from a corner finds Fellaini inside the box. His touch kills it dead, laying it back for Alderweireld to strike. He goals for goal with his weak foot, right into the corner, but it's tipped aside by his club teammate Lloris.

23': A simple long ball comes to Giroud, but his touch isn't the required contact, and it sails harmlessly out.

28': Fellaini wins the ball back high up the pitch, gives the ball too Hazard, who creates some space and plays it out wide to de Bruyne. His whipped crosses is blocked just before Lukaku can tap it in. Yet another corner. Oly a matter of time before a delivery finds itself poked into the back of either net.

28': Giroud is fouled, resulting in the first free-kick of the game. Has been very open, as well as end-to-end.

31': Pavard, in acres of space, dinks a ball up to Giroud on the penalty spot. It's just behind him, so his header sends it wide. Decent effort.

31': Wicked feet from Hazard to make it past 3 players ear the touchline, but his last touch *just* sends it over the touchline.

33': Intricate work from Griezmann and Hernandez on the left side finds him with a little bit of space on the edge of the box. He cuts inside, shifting it nicely to open the shot up, but it's on his weak foot, and sails comfortably over.

34': Glorious chance for France goes begging. A beautiful ball over the top from Griezmann finds Mbappé, who cushions a pass on the volley into Giroud in the middle of the box. On the stretch, he hits it wide, and, all told, it's a poor miss. Probably should've anticipated the ball across better, but France are looking creative nonetheless.

37': Beautiful work at the back from France beats the Belgium press. Griezmann breaks, cutting through the heart of the Belgian midfield, but he delays a pass out to Matuidi, who then becomes offside, so takes the shot on himself. Dragged well wide.

38': Giroud takes a breather on the touchline after taking a hit, but it's just that: a breather to recover.

39': Mbappé slots a ball gently, with the outside of his right boot, through two Belgian defenders to find Pavard, who has an open shot at goal. His shot is decent, but it's much too low, and Courtois' ankle denies him. Best chance of the game, and France will be hoping it doesn't come back to haunt them.

42': De Bruyne comes in late on Hernández, sticking out a leg to trip him up. An unnecessary foul.

44': Pogba pulled down by Dembélé, just outside the area. In a dangerous area, but it'll take a fantastic strike to beat the tall Belgian wall, as well as the equally-huge goalkeeper.

44': The shot from Griezmann is slammed straight in the wall.

45+1': Beautiful delivery from de Bruyne on the right flank beats Umtiti, only taking a slight touch, and finding Lukaku in the area, only a few paces out. The big Belgian forward, who hasn't been involved too much yet in this knockout match, is taken by surprise that it beats theFrench centre-half, and it comes off of him, out for a goal-kick.

---

[](#icon-clock) **Half-Time:** [](#sprite6-p60) **0-0** [](#sprite6-p17) 

Despite being level at the half, the net yet to bulge for either team, the game has been very open, and balances on a knife edge going into the second period. It could really go either way, and both teams look very dangerous. Mbappé has been the shining light for France so far, and Kanté has been typically solid in the Blues' midfield.

---

45': [](#icon-clock) Belgium's turn for kick-off, shooting from left-to-right, and the second half gets underway. There's sure to be a goal, and you have to think that'll open the floodgates.

47': All starting from a beautiful cross-field ball from Alderweireld to switch the play, a spell of Belgian possession results in a cross from deep from the DM, Wistel. It finds the head of Lukaku, but the finish is poor, skimming off of the *top* of the number 9's head over the bar.

49': De Bruyne tries to slot Lukaku in, but it's interecepted by Umtiti. Belgium have started the second half very strongly.

51': [](#sprite6-p60) [](#icon-ball) **GOALLLL! France! Samuel Umtiti/Fellaini (OG). A beautiful corner delivery from Griezmann glances off the head of Umtiti at the near post. It brushes the head of Fellaini on the way, and slots into the far corner. [1]-0**

54': France have a free-kick in a dangerous area at the left corner of the area, but the floated cross is dealt with comfortably. It breaks to De Bruyne, and then to Hazard, who Hernández brings down to stop a counter. No card.

56': Calm and full of flair inside the box, Mbappé receives the ball, turns, and [*backheels* the ball to play in Giroud](https://www.clippituser.tv/c/pladdb). Giroud is 1-on-1 with Courtois, but the shot is well kept out.

60': [](#sprite6-p17) [](#icon-up) Dries Mertens [](#icon-down) Mousa Dembélé. First substitution of the game goes to the trailing team. De Bruyne drops deeper. *1/3*.

61': Early contribution from Mertens! Lukaku plays the ball to him down the right, and he hangs a ball up to the back post. It's headed away uncontested, but falls to de Bruyne on the edge of the box. He slices it, and it falls easily to Lloris to be collected.

63': [](#sprite6-p17) [](#icon-yellow) Hazard shown a card for bringing down Matuidi, taking one for the team to prevent a counter after de Bruyne gave the ball away too easily.

65': A peach of a cross from Mertens finds Fellaini on the penalty spot, who outmuscles his marker Pogba. His header is powerful, but the angle isn't quite right, and it slides past the near post, perhaps a yard wide.

67': Mbappé skips past the sliding challenge of de Bruyne on the right wing, opening u plenty of space for a France counter-attack, with Griezmann and Giroud bombing down the pitch with him. He chips a ball to Griezmman on the other side, who plays a sidefooted pass back to Giroud. From 18 yards, the striker flashes it well over the bar. France have been very creative and silky, but Giroud needs to put on his finishing boots if France want to widen the margin.

71': [](#sprite6-p17) [](#icon-yellow) Alderweireld clips Matuidi's ankles to avoid a footrace.

79': A neat one-two by Hazard and Lukaku results in Hazard being tripped up by Giroud just outside the box. Clear foul, but the referee waves play-on, denying Belgium a much-needed opportunity.

80': [](#sprite6-p17) [](#icon-up) Carrasco [](#icon-down) Fellaini. *2/3*.

84': [](#sprite6-p60) [](#icon-up) Nzonzi [](#icon-down) Giroud. Defensive substitution, France looking to shore up and protect their lead for the last 10 minutes. *1/3*.

85': Matuidi brought down yet again. 

86': [](#sprite6-p60) [](#icon-up) Tolisso [](#icon-down) Matuidi. He put in a good performance, and his fresh-legged replacement, who filled in for him in the previous game due to suspension, replaces him yet again. *2/3*.

87': [](#sprite6-p60) [](#icon-yellow) Kanté given a card for bringing down Eden Hazard, after being all over him before the final foul. 

88': The free-kick is much too far out for a direct shot, but the ball from De Bruyne is deep, and is fluffed before being cleared.

89': De Bruyne's next delivery is much more threatening, dropping at the back post for an uncontested Lukaku header. It passes in front of his forehead by a mere inch.

90+1': [](#sprite6-p17) [](#icon-up) Batshuayi [](#icon-down) Chadli. Offensive substitution, one final throw of the dice for Belgium. *3/3*.

90+2': [](#sprite6-p60) [](#icon-yellow) Mbappé awarded a yellow card for throwing the ball away.

90+3': Griezmann with a great opportunity, but his finish is tried, and saved.

90+4': [](#sprite6-p17) [](#icon-yellow) Vertonghen booked for flailing his arms at Mbappé by the touchline. Frustration coming through as the defeat looms.

90+6': Game ends after an almighty, and very scrappy, 6 minutes of injury time. France have booked their place in their 3rd World Cup Final! Now it's just time to see whether their competition for the gold will be Croatia or England.

Dear (SpacemasterTom)
 
Thank you for your email.

**Everton**

Dear (SpacemasterTom)

Thank you for writing to Everton Football Club.

Everton……The best team in the world. Evertonians are born not made. You don't understand what it is to love Everton unless you actually do, they're more than just a football team.
 
The history of Everton Football Club is so much more than the players who have graced the hallowed Goodison Park turf.
 
There's more to Everton than the trophies in the cabinet; the Toffees have been constant innovators in the footballing world, ceaselessly striving to be the best, and the first to accomplish new feats, while establishing new norms. The Nil Satis Nisi Optimum (""Nothing but the best is good enough"") motto could not be more appropriate.
 
From becoming one of the founder members of the football league in 1888, right through to present day when we announced a new service which allows fans to purchase match tickets through text message,
 
Everton have always been at the forefront of new ideas.
 
Did you know we were the first to wear numbers on our backs, the first to have a purpose-built football stadium, and the first go on an overseas tour?
 
Below is an extensive list of some of the significant landmarks that Everton Football Club has accomplished since its birth. 
 

Founder members of the Football League in 1888

Founder members of the FA Premier League in 1992

First club to be presented with the League Championship trophy

First club to present medals for winning the Championship

First club to stage an FA Cup final 1894, Notts County v Bolton Wanderers

First club on Merseyside to win the FA Cup 1906

 First club to go on an overseas football tour

First club to construct a purpose built football stadium

First club to have a four-sided stadium with two tier stands

First club to have a stadium with a three tier stand

First club to issue a regular match programme for home fixtures

 First club to have a player (William Ralph Dean) score 60 league goals

First club to wear numbered shirts from 1-11 (1933 FA Cup final)

First club to have a church attached to its stadium

First club to install dugouts

First club to install undersoil heating

First club to win a penalty shootout in the European Cup 1970 v Borussia Moenchengladbach

First club to play 4000 top-flight games

First club to amass 5000 League points

First club to play 100 seasons in the top-flight

First club to stage a World Cup semi-final in Britain

First club to have the youngest Premiership goalscorer in two consecutive seasons with two different players

First club to break the £100,000 transfer threshold when Alan Ball moved from Blackpool for £110,000 in 1966.

 First club to be featured in a TV game in August 1936 v Arsenal.  Not live (pre-recorded).

First club to have scoreboard half time/full time facility

First club to have its own podcast

First club to have its own online social networking site.

First club to sell tickets via text message.

**Crystal Palace**

Hi (SpacemasterTom),
 
Thanks for your email.
 
Please find below a few reasons why supporting Crystal Palace may appeal to you:
 
·         We have fantastic fans and an infectious atmosphere (see displays from the recent FA Cup Final)

·         An exciting counter-attacking style of football

·         A rich history

 
But most importantly we have an excellent international membership scheme which has several perks for supporters overseas, including priority booking for Premier League matches and a tour of Selhurst Park. Please follow this link for further information on the memberships available - https://www.cpfctickets.com/memberships.aspx
 
From a personal point of view I chose Crystal Palace as my Premier League club after moving to London from Scotland a couple of years ago, and hopefully you will decide to do the same!
 
Hope this helps.
Kind regards,
Euan

**Barnet**

Dear (SpacemasterTom),
 
Thank you for your e-mail and it is great to hear that you are looking to support a Club, even all the way from Bosnia & Herzegovina!
 
Barnet FC is a Club which welcomes supporters from all walks of life, with a friendly, family atmosphere and of course, offering some exciting football. The Team is currently preparing for its second Season in League Two following promotion as Champions in the 14/15 Season, and we also recently moved to The Hive London (2013) - an international training facility visited by a number of National Teams, such as Brazil, Germany, Sweden and Chile.
 
There is always a lot going on and we would love for you to find out more, so should you be able to share your address with us, we would be happy to post you some extra information. In the meantime, why not keep up with the Team at www.barnetfc.com and check out our sister Club the London Bees WSL, too: www.londonbeeswsl.com.
 
Thank you for writing to us and we hope to hear back from you.

Treyarch - A Report From the Community,"Sorry for updating so late guys, things have been chaotic for me recently. I have majorly updated the post after reading the patch notes from Treyarch.

Again guys, I'm sorry.

If things have been patched, inform me in a kindly manner and I will remove it. I have been trying to keep up with the patch notes, but there is a lot of things not mentioned in the notes. I try my best to keep up.

Will update as I am informed.

***Necessary, Immediate Action Preferred:***

|Zombie Die Out Feature|Very much so improved. The doubled bleed out time is a lot better. Solo players would still prefer no bleed out though. Makes it increasingly difficult.|
|:-|:-|
|Zombies Should Count for the Black Market|How come only Blackout and Multiplayer counts? It's almost like it is two different games. One side is the people who get all the fun stuff and the content, and the other side doesn't get anything except a small zombie exclusive event. People do play Multiplayer, Blackout, but play Zombies more. It would help out in the Black Market events.|
|Dogs/Nova Crawlers Spawning in front of Player|Dogs/Nova Crawlers should be unable to do this, as the dogs/Nova Crawlers spawn in before they are able to even be seen. Theory has been proven to be that an invisible Dog/Nova Crawlers spawn in front of the player.|
|Host Migration|The problem is that when a host leaves, everybody else gets a game over. This needs fixing.|
|PC Aiming/Controller|Aiming on PC with controller is broken, and the aim assist is needed, or else you're kerfunkled.|

***Necessary, No Immediate Action Required, But Preferred Soon:***

|Magmagat Red Screen|The red screen when taking damage from the Magmagat is exaggerated. Red screen is the same as taking full damage from zombies, when the player is actually taking minimal damage. Just a slight tone down is needed.|
|:-|:-|
|Winter's Wail|Buff needed. This perk is basically useless with how long the cooldown time is.|
|Bandolier Bandit|Buff needed. Could add more ammo to create a greater desire for the perk. Could also affect grenades or duration of special weapon.|
|Timeslip|Nerf possibly needed, as traps can be activated quickly.|
|Death Perception|Buff needed. If Death Perception was like Vulture Aid, it would be used more, probably, even if it was just a modifier. Could be based on vicinity so that screen remains uncluttered.|
|Hell's Redeemer|Buff needed. Can barely kill zombies (3 Max) and only recharges quicker. No need for it to be a God-tier weapon, but the upgrade process is not worth it.|
|Monkey Bomb|Buff needed. Animation is very long.|
|PC Splitscreen|This feature is very desired. There is no splitscreen on PC, but if it is done on consoles, it should also be manageable for PC. Maybe by adding in multiple devices, such as controllers.|
|Splitscreen Pausing|If someone is playing with a friend or friends on splitscreen, please add in a pause feature. Things happen, we need the ability to pause. We aren't playing online. We are there in agreement. It doesn't hinder the other player's experience, it just means that something came up for whoever is playing, which would also come up for the other players.|
|Acid Gat Buff|Acid Gat is horribly nerfed, without aiming the gun literally sprays the bullets everywhere. Not only that, it doesn't really do that much damage, and does a lot of damage to the player. Gun can shoot so slowly, it can shoot a bomb at your feet because it is still shooting in the reload animation.|

***Extremely Wanted, but not Needed:***

|Perk Jingles|No change to the perk systems, just if we could get the normal jingles back for the Aether perks that we already know, that would be awesome.|
|:-|:-|
|Global Leaderboards|Rather than just showing the max 200 friends, but to actually show global records. Such as with previous games, should be by every map.|
|PC Local Mode|Many want PC to have a local mode, even despite this being difficult and (maybe) impossible since the game is through Battle Net.|
|Weapon Mastery Camos|This is being addressed by Treyarch in upcoming updates.|
|Main Menu Music Options|Plenty of people would like the option to select Damned to play as the zombie menu theme. The new music is good, it's just the old music is the zombie mode's theme. Something like Black Ops 3 with its music selection would be great.|
|Zombie Weapons|Weapons exclusive to Zombies areas in Blackout are missing from the actual Zombies modes, such as the Galil.|
|Experience|This is being addressed by Treyarch in upcoming updates.|
|Offline/Custom Mutations Easter Eggs|Custom Mutations should have easter eggs. Trophies and everything can be disabled, but easter eggs are really wanted in custom mutations. It does make it too easy for easter egg hunts, but this can easily be solved by either locking the easter eggs in custom mutations that have not been discovered and then unlocking the easter eggs in custom mutations once they have been solved.|
|Nuke Flash|The white flash after the nuke goes on a little bit too long. It is blinding. It definitely gets the point across, just a little too well.|
|Match ""Leaderboards""|I don't actually know what to call it, but people want to be able to check their kills, downs, and revives within the actual game of zombies. Like how when you touch the touch pad in BO3 and it pulled up the inventory and such.|
|Weapon Inspections|This is self-explantory. It's just an awesome feature that should also be in Zombies. Heck, make it like WWII zombies and make us just hold down triangle for a short time to inspect it.|
|Old Perk System Option|This idea is really liked by the community. This could be done in custom mutations or the like, but it would be great if the old perk system could be selected for the Aether story. It's not very tough to do, considering that the new perk system still works on the basis of four perks being the limit. The Der Wunderfizz could be added in for the machines that have not been updated. It would just be a fun thing for a custom game or custom mode.|
|Character Selection|For solo, character selection would be simple. After choosing the map to play in a private match, you could be moved to a character select screen and choose. For co-op and public matches, this would be more difficult. Though, I'm sure that this could be thought about and executed.|
|Near Death Screen|In BO3, you could easily tell when you were about to go down, especially in Zombies Chronicles. BO4 does not have a near death screen, you just go down. The health bar does is there for a reason, but it is difficult to have to check the health bar when you are in the heat of battle with the undead.|
|Weapon Prestige Indicator|Indicator showing what prestige a weapon is on in the Armory.|
|Weapon Variants (Signature Weapons)|Community would love to have weapon variants in zombies.|
|Custom Skins in Zombies|These could insist of outfits, such as the Primis Templar outfits. Maybe even in custom mutations, we could have skins of Blackout characters, like Woods.|
|Health Regeneration|Maybe if it could be increased just a tiny, tiny bit. Not enough to where you are scared, but just a little quicker. Especially for Quick Revive, since I can barely tell a difference.|

***Kinda Wanted, but not Needed:***

|Subtitles for Cutscenes|This is a personal thing, but the Blood of the Dead ending had me full of emotions, but it was difficult to understand what Richtofen was saying. The subtitles were there, they just didn't play over the cutscene. Whether or not this was a glitch, and whether or not this was fixed, I do not know. I just think it would be nice to have the subtitles since I have a hard time hearing.|

|Pack-a-Punch Indicator|Some in the community want an indicator on which PAP the weapon is on rather than just the price changing, even if the indicator it is just a small number beside the name of the weapon. A solution could be adding ""Mark I, Mark II, … Mark IV"" at the end of the weapon to indicate what PAP it is on. The Pack-a-Punch showing that you increase damage is a step in the right direction, I would just prefer a more specific indicator.|
|Parts Notification|When picking up parts like in BO3, players should get a notification pop up to show which part you obtain.|
|Pack-a-Punch Location Indicator|Some type of indicator that shows where the Pack-a-Punch is located in Blood of the Dead.|

***Glitches, Needing Immediate Attention:***

|Fast Traveling into Unopened Area|Players can fast travel to location that has not been opened yet, resulting in the player immediately taking damage and dying. This might not be a glitch, but closed areas should not have fast travel access.|
|:-|:-|
|Blood of the Dead - Roof|Zombie pathing is very glitchy. Mainly in co-op.|
|Winter's Wail - Hitboxes|Zombies' hitboxes, when affected by Winter's Wail, are abnormal and glitchy.|
|PC - Deadshot Dealer|Does not snap on to zombies.|
|Brain Rot Tiger|If the last Tiger has Brain Rot on it, it will not drop a Max Ammo. (I believe this has been addressed, but need confirmation.)|
|Full Power - Deactivating|When the Specialist Weapon deactivates and then levels up, if a Full Power is grabbed, the charge goes to zero.|
|Connection Interrupted on High Rounds|A player going down on high rounds causes connection interruptions.|
|Private Match Glitch|Possible glitch which kicks host out of private matches and migrates host to the other players after a short amount of time.|
|Gamechat on Xbox One|Reportedly, gamechat rarely works on Xbox.|
|Reviving Bots Glitch|Bots can get stuck reviving the downed player, causing both of them to be unable to move, or the reverse can happen where the player cannot revive downed bots.|
|Anywhere but Here|Glitch which results in the player bouncing off of areas and eventually exiting the map and dying, or just teleporting out of the playable area in general.|
|Players Unable to Play (A TOP PRIORITY)|Some players on PC have reported being unable to enter the game, despite their PC being capable, or being unable to join servers.|
|Disconnections|Too many disconnections, even occurring in solo games sometimes.|
|Game Crash|Explanation is not needed for this, it’s just still not fixed.|
|Game Crash on Splitscreen in BoTD|When reaching certain point in Blood, the game crashes in splitscreen. Spectral Shield is though to be the trigger.|
|Crawler Damage|Possible glitch where crawler takes all of the player’s health in one hit.|
|Electric Burst|Reports of a glitch with Electric Burst perk, occurring after going down with aftertaste, resulting in player not being able to use the perk, even though they have bought it.|
|Docks Step Softlock|Spirit in the Infirmary can disappear.|
|Nowhere but There|Glitch causing player to clip through the map, eventually leading to death.|
|Possible Banjo Glitch|Glitch that could occur where players cannot grab the banjo from the spirit in the shower.|
|Possible Banjo Glitch II|If anyone grabs the Banjo and enters the circles, they are continuously downed, which could lead to the other possible Banjo glitch.|
|Possible Banjo Glitch III|Sometimes, even without going down, the step just goes on eternally, only ending when the game ends.|
|Possible Banjo Glitch IV|If someone's Dying Wish activates, the step could be softlocked to where the Banjo cannot be retrieved.|
|Self Revive Token|If you use a self revive token and a teammate revives you, you will be kept in Last Stand.|
|Bandolier Bandit|When getting a Max Ammo, the perk makes it to where ammo is not always fully restored, and generally is very glitchy with ammo.|
|Possible Bird Step|Sometimes the birds do not spawn in. No location contains a bird.|
|Hell's Retriever Glitch Spot|Specific location where player can crouch or go prone and can pick up Hell's Retriever but softlocks everything.|
|Hole Between Spawn to New Industries|If you go prone within a specific hole, you can go below the map slightly.|
|UI Glitches|XP does not track sometimes and levels also do not update.|
|Electricity|Electricity seems to crash game in the later rounds, possibly due to too much animations or such.|
|IX Key Glitch|If you survive three waves in the Pit, you cannot grab the key.|
|Zombies with Fast Travel|When using fast travel, zombies are already waiting for you at your location, even the Gondola. It makes it quite tricky when you pop out and are instantly getting back handed.|
|Pausing Glitch|Players are able to pause the game before the match actually starts (when screen is black), this causes players to be unable to move or shoot.|
|Ragnarok DG-5 God Spots|The DG-5s can be slammed down and allow the player to get on top of objects, such as PAP, tables, etc.|
|Shield Exploit in Classified|Players can camp in the corner where the shield is and constantly rebuy the shield after it breaks, and using the gun can easily kill zombies. It isn't cheating, but can almost be guaranteed to not be intended.|
|Bots Friendly Fire|In some occurrences, bots have friendly fire enabled and can down the actual players.|
|Blue Screen with Zeus Tower|Blue screens can occur when all the champions spawn in to complete the Zeus Tower in IX.|
|Mule Kick in IX|When obtaining Mule Kick from the challenge in IX, the game believes you are cheating an takes away all weapons and points, etc.|
|IX Round Change - Fire|When the round changes, if you die to fire, your screen is glitched with heat animations and take damage after revived.|
|Nowhere But There - Same Room|If you use the Elixir in the same ""room"" as the downed player, it teleports the user out of the room.|
|Anywhere But Here - Distance|Sometimes when using Anywhere But Here, the Elixir sends you 3 - 5 meters away from the zombies, sometimes teleporting you to the same place you're standing.|
|Blightfather Tongue|If you kill a Blightfather while it is pulling you in, you can get stuck permanently.|
|Cordite Belt Feed PAP|This Operator Mod on the Cordite causes the game to crash when PAP'ing.|

***Glitches, No Immediate Action Needed, But Preferred Soon:***

|Zweihandler|Profile glitches out, as the damage/rate of fire/ammo changes constantly while viewing it in the armory.|
|:-|:-|
|Auger|Auger has MP camos instead of the zombies camos. The gun displays and uses the MP equivalent.|
|Aether Bowie Knife Camo|Camo does not work on Bowie Knife in Aether maps.|
|Clan Tag/Kill Count|Guns prestiged can still not have clan tag or the kill count on them.|
|SDM PAP|When having iron sights equipped on the SDM, after Pack-a-Punching, the SDM gets its default scope back.|
|Hell's Retriever and Redeemer and Power-Ups|I believe this is just a problem with hitboxes, but the Hell's Retriever has a HELL of a hard time grabbing power-ups. I believe that the power-ups just have a tiny hitbox.|
|Theater Mode|Zombies has many glitches in theater mode, especially when trying to skip by 30 seconds.|
|Paintjobs|They just don't work.|
|Specialist Weapons Information|Simple UI glitch when players hover over the Specialist Weapons information do not show up, or only pop up for a split second.|

***Is This Intended or a Glitch? These Might Be Intended, as Treyarch Stated So:***

|Ray Gun and Brutus|Ray Gun deals minimal damage to the Warden.|
|:-|:-|
|Brazen Bull Upgrade|The upgrade parts are invisible.|
|Extended/Hybrid Magazines|Do not give more reserve ammo. Bandolier Bandit also does not give ammo on top of its regular bonus for weapons with extended mags. Can also lead to odd numbered magazine capacities.|
|Sniper Headshot Sound|Very loud compared to other weapons.|

***Suggestions/Ideas:***

|Old School Game Mode|Juggernog, Double Tap, Speed Cola, and Quick Revive are put into their proper places in the Aether maps. Original point system. 100 Health, and forced starting pistol.|
|:-|:-|
|Long Lasting Elixirs|Long lasting Elixirs, such as Aftertaste, should not be affected by using Nowhere but There or Anywhere but Here.|
|Camos and Pack-a-Punching|Adding in the ability to keep regular camos after PAP'ing. Such as if the guns have the zombie variants of dark matter, gold, etc. Or maybe even adding the two camos together someway.|
|Pausing|Maybe if all the players in private or public matches all pause, it would pause the game.|
|Dying Wish|Could knock zombies away from you.|
|Full Power Stock|Could stock the Special Weapon twice or slightly level it up.|
|Selecting Certain Challenges|Selecting certain challenges before the match could allow the player to view overall progress.|

Remembering back to the interview you made when you first made it to the starting position, he said you hope to surpass Bang, now you are one of the only two player along side Bang to win Worlds twice as AD, picking up SKT's legacy, you are the last gift of SKT, the best ADC in the world, congratulation Gumayusi.|

|Bin Jax|7.8|The top laner that was invisible for 5 game straight, do you also have one of those best top in your region? (Top Comment: Over 4000 days later, we failed again trying to climb over this mountain, watch my favorite team, and a full Chinese roster got to finals,  I was really happy, sadly we couldn't left the trophy in the end. I know no team tried to market themselves with the full Chinese squad brand, I know that game and nationality probably doesn't have much relation, but watching Koreans kept reaching success in my favorite game, and some of our own people talking down about ourselves, I couldn't help but feel a bit sad and anger. Shout out to the 5 peat legendary Demon King Faker who refused to thumb down his opponent after a win, congratulation to the legendary T1 team, thank you for creating all the unforgettable moments for the players; Also shout out to the team that former BLG coach Tabe played on in the past, RYL, watching the younger generation fails again in the final, would it brings you back to that day 4000 days ago?

A lot of people only voted for game 5 after the game is over, so game 5 rating is probably less correlated to actual game 5 performance, more resemble an overall rating.

|Inspired Fiddlesticks|9.9|Didn't turtle and act scared, kept trying new things, you guys are really fighting with no regret. (Top comment: I can quote Duoduo here: ""A butterfly cannot fly across the vast sea; no one has the heart to blame it."")|
|Quad Yone|9.8|Samsung leaving Yone open, once you pick it they will take Smolder, its all calculated. (Top comment: I was once a 02 prodigy, a genius with Cassio, I met Chovy when I was 14, he is the starter in 2020, I was his sub, my record as DRX wasn't great, I want to play what I play but feels so locked down by the meta, Chovy did great, and he became a star, and I was abandoned, went all the way across the Pacific. Time flies, I thought about retiring, sell out my dream, and become a streamer, but I popped off in NA, got some good result, and I blended into this team, not locked down by the meta, only summoner with full freedom. No one believe us in the knockout stage, my opponent for quarters is Chovy, I know this is the best shot to prove myself, I don't want to live in your shadow anymore, I'm also talented. I thought about victory at 2-1, I really want to see you head down, crying with regret. In the last game we picked Yone, and you instant locked in the Smolder comp, we are not match in the face of meta and counters, who is the one with regret, I think the answer was clear 4 years ago, real life is not as perfect as those stories, I m still beneath him in the end. Will we meet again next year, I don't know, will FLY change roster, I don't know, where is my next stop, I don't know, same spot I was 4 years ago, some people might never meet again, like Scorpius and Orion, I'm Quad, also a talent, see you next year.)|

Hope on your way back home, you are not thinking about: What if we didn't go sneak the baron, what if I didn't hit the blast cone. You guys performed so well under pressure, it is like dancing on the tips of knives, even comparing with internationally, you guys are still a top team, keep it up, looking forward to the day when you guys finally able to lift the trophy.)|

Bloons TD 6 v31.0 - Update Preview! upcoming v31.0,"[ Update 31 coming soon! ](https://preview.redd.it/ldbqdc0a17s81.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=d21257a549d0b1628bd6694f84723b4c1085c8b7)

**Bloons TD 6 v31.0 -**  **Update Preview! upcoming v30.0** 

**Key New Features**

* **New Hero, Geraldo the Mystic Shopkeeper!**
   * A bold adventurer and seeker of fine things, Geraldo has explored the distant, mysterious reaches of the Monkey world to assemble his signature collection
   * Geraldo is almost nothing without his shop, so select the “Shop” icon next to Geraldo’s portrait when he is selected; the shop will remember its open or closed state for easy access
   * Shop items have a variety of uses - some place on the map, some on the track, others target Monkeys or subtowers; they all must be pulled from the shop to the playfield
   * Get ready for a wild ride, as Geraldo is intended to be a “build” hero, supporting a variety of strategies that are designed to scale; heaps of dev and balance time behind this one - we hope you enjoy the mysteries!
* **New Bloon Boss - Vortex, Deadly Master of Air!**
   * Affectionately known as speedy boi, but it may be some time before you feel any affection for this incredibly tough boss
   * Spawns with a temporary shield of wind that for a short time blows away all projectiles that are too slow to pass through it
   * Natural Bloon spawns are buffed by Vortex’s slipstream, moving at incredible speeds until they catch up
   * On Skulls Vortex stuns all nearby towers with a burst of lightning, activates its storm shield, and retreats a short distance
   * Periodically triggers a storm wave that destroys all projectiles in a large radius
   * Distributed placements and ranged attacks are key to victory - good luck!

**New Awesome**

* New Beginner Map, Scrapyard!
   * Old cars and other scrap go to die in places off the beaten track, but the Bloons have even found this remote location; defend the derelicts and don’t forget to play with the heavy machinery!
   * Sorry to the players who submitted similar ideas during the competition, but we already had our own idea in the works for a while now
* New Trophy Store Items
   * Bloons: Cat Ear Bloons, Disguise Glasses
   * Co-op: Pat Flex emote,  Mind Blown emote
   * Game & UI: Sunshine Serenade - Fiesta Mix music track, 2 New Avatars - Super Monkey & Striker Jones
   * Reddit Banner Competition winners
      * Banner winner (Arrival) - by betapotata
      * Banner winner (Beneath the Waves) - by Cyliia 

**Big Changes / Additions**

* New Special Conditions for Custom Challenge victory
   * Least Cash has no limits on earning cash & allows all forms of income generation, but rewards victory only if a player remains below a chosen cash spent threshold
   * Least Tiers limits victory to staying under a chosen value of tiers which increments for every tower/ upgrades/ hero/ level purchased
   * We added these special conditions for victory as we thought they would be fun on their own, but we also have them in mind for the Contested Territory update coming later this year, as a variety of victory conditions will make the team dynamics needed to capture and hold a range of territory more interesting
* Updated Heroes Screen
   * We’ve been wanting to update the Heroes screen for awhile, so with the addition of our 14th Hero, Geraldo, we made that happen
   * Hopefully you will enjoy the full rework - making it easier to see all Heroes, allowing side by side comparisons of Heroes’ powers, and surfacing the visual changes that accompany various upgrades
* To prevent event games running past the final cutoff on score submission time, there will now be a short break in the final moments of competitive events in which the event is still active but no further games can be started
* Structural and performance reworks to Bloons and the Bloon overlay system. All in the interest of tighter code and more flexibility for future updates.
* Added commas to Cash, Damage Numbers, & Income for increased visibility and slightly delayed visits to your respective optometrists
* Large changes to backend co-op game communication between clients for increased stability
* Facebook friends’ scores has been replaced with LiNK Friends scores so that we have more reliable control of score sharing; please note your Facebook friends will not autopopulate into your LiNK Friends - you will have to reestablish any Friend connections manually
* Due to demand over the years, we have added a Logout option to our in game webview.

**Bug Fixes & General Changes**

* Resolved an issue with Custom Odyssey title/description being reset
* Changed how boss bloon status overlays are applied to look better
* Resolved an issue with Techbot ignoring hard limits on ability use in custom challenges in regards to overlap, causing laggy animation loops
* Resolved players getting booted out of co-op sessions on some low end devices due to being timed out from a long desync
* Optimizations made to freeplay roundsets
* Using Thrive right before defeat, and restarting should no longer break the animation
* Fixed some incorrect medal displays on leaderboards
* Resolved some specific cases causing the pause penalty on races to carry over onto the next attempt
* Map Area data converted to a new System which should improve performance & allow for more complex shapes
* Rocket Storm ability is now grayed out between rounds
* Add new localization for all hero skins to remove ‘skin’ from their names on player profiles.
* Resolved some issues with hero skins changing when changing owner in co-op
* Resolved a number of rare crashes

Boomerang Monkey

* 5xx Boomerang glaives again crosspath correctly with xx2

Monkey Buccaneer

* Resolved Buccaneer showing wrong upgrade text after upgrading a ninja

Heli Pilot

* 104 Heli's Mini Comanche now correctly fire 5 darts at a time 
* xx5 Comanche Commander's damage has been corrected with crosspaths

Mortar Monkey

* 502 Mortar now applies burn to DDTs without MIB so long as they circumvent the camo

Dartling Gunner

* x5x MAD height inconsistencies compare to x4x Rocket Storm have been resolved

Wizard Monkey

* 042 Summon Phoenix should now correctly interact with camo prio

Ninja Monkey

* Resolved an issue with Master Bomber Stickies sometimes hitting regular Bloons instead of MOABs

Druid

* 5xx Superstorm now benefits from Ball Lightning 25% freeze chance regardless of crosspath
* Resolved an issue with the Cold Front MK not always showing ice overlays on Bloons

Monkey Village

* Resolved some inconsistencies with top path farm buff icons

Engineer

* xx4 Bloon Trap issue resolved on Sunken Columns with Bloontraps falling under the map in certain locations
* 014 Bloon Trap issue resolved with certain conditions causing Bloontraps to repeatedly auto-collect even while empty

Adora

* Adora sacrifice buff should now apply to Mini Sun Avatars from Temples

Admiral Brickell

* Resolved an issue with Admiral Brickell's Mega Mine sometimes not showing stun effects

**Desktop Version**

* If you have already placed your hero, your ‘Hero hotkey’ (U by default) will now swap to instead ‘select your hero’ wherever it is. If you have more than one hero this will cycle through them
* Resolved an issue with using hotkeys during loading screens causing some tower portraits to become faded out

**Balance Changes** 

Dart Monkey

To add a little more synergetic crosspath use for the Juggernaut 402 crosspath, xx2 will now also grant bonus projectile lifespan, this applies to any use of that crosspath though we feel it will in particular pair nicely with the ricocheting projectiles. Juggernaut in general is also seeing a small utility knockback buff to help it carry on a little longer into the game.

* xx1 Long Range Darts also increases projectile lifespan +15%
* xx2 Enhanced Eyesight also increases projectile lifespan +20%
* 4xx Juggernaut gains a slight Bloon knockback (Same as xx3 dartling, but half duration)

Bomb Shooter

The Frags crosspath for top path Bomb Shooter has always been quite a poor choice, trying to compete with attack speed as a benefit for stun utility isn’t going to ever work out so we have instead gone the route of turning the frags crosspath into a DPS/Stun hybrid with a lot of small buffs to frag power.

* 302 Really Big Bombs frag damage increased 1 -> 3
* 302 Really Big Bombs gains more frags 8 -> 12
* 402 Bloon Impact frag pierce increased +1
* 402 Bloon Impact frag damage increased 2 -> 3
* 402 Bloon Impact gains even more frags 8 -> 16
* 502 Bloon Crush remains at frag damage 12
* 502 Bloon Crush frags gain bonus to ceramic +12
* 502 Bloon Crush gains frag pierce 3 -> 20

Glue Gunner

Whoops, looks like I forgot to write anything.

* 2xx Corrosive Glue DoT rate increased 2.3s -> 2
* 3xx Bloon Dissolver DoT ceramic bonus increased 0 -> 1
* 4xx Bloon Liquifier DoT ceramic bonus unchanged
* 5xx The Bloon Solver bonus moab damage increased 3 -> 5

Monkey Sub

Energizer upgrade offers nothing extra to the reactor sub aside from niche utility buffs, so we have increased the lategame cleanup potential by a large amount to help deal with Super Ceramics.

* 5xx Energizer damage increased 3 -> 5
* 5xx Energizer now adds bonus damage to ceramics +5

Monkey Buccaneer

The base Grape attack of T4 MOAB Takedown has had a ceramic bonus added to lead up to the T5 a little better.

* x4x MOAB Takedown grapeshot ceramic bonus added +1

Monkey Ace

Spy Plane is always a lesser crosspath aside from specific challenges that call for camo detection. It has a similar vibe to Night Vision sniper so we have given it a similar buff.

* x2x Spy Plane grants attacks bonus damage to camos +1

Heli Pilot

Previously Razor Rotor’s used to make the heli pursue for a further distance & this caused it to often fail to reach Lead Bloons with the rotor attack that could pop them. This overall seemed like a design flaw so that back-off distance has been moved up to the T4 instead. Apache Dartship has also fallen off over time as a viable saveup for prime, though it is meant to be reasonably difficult some changes have made this a little more difficult than it probably should be so we have increased the pierce of the machinegun attack.

* 3xx Razor Rotor’s pursuit no longer backs so far away from Leads that it can’t hit them
* 4xx Apache Dartship pursuit distance increase now occurs here
* 4xx Apache Dartship Machinegun pierce increased 5 -> 7
* 5xx Apache Prime Machinegun pierce unchanged

Dartling Gunner

Ray of Doom suffers from the downsides of being designed as a high piercing tower, for the price this makes it feel far too weak against the round 100 BAD if you invest in it too early without some other forms of single target, to bring back a little of the interesting sort of targeting that the T4 has and help with this single target problem it will now deal a massive damage bonus to the first target hit along the beam’s path.

* 5xx Ray of Doom now deals bonus damage to the first target hit +55
* 3xx Laser Cannon pierce increased from 4 -> 6
* 302 Laser Cannon pierce increased from 6 -> 9
* xx2 Powerful Darts now also gives 'larger projectiles' as a crosspath
   * 002 Powerful Darts normal projectile size increased from 2 -> 3
   * 032 Hydra Rocket Pods explosion size increased from 8 -> 12
   * 402 Plasma Accelerator focal point size increased from 4 -> 6
   * 402 Plasma Accelerator beam width increased from 2 -> 3
   * 502 Ray of Doom beam width increased from 6 -> 9

Wizard Monkey

Arcane Blast's benefit to the base tower is quite small for the price and also doesn't carry on well as a crosspath to the other T3s since they add new attacks instead of buffing the base attack, the price has been reduced to add a little more value here along with more MOAB damage at the T5 to give it a little more value over Arcane Spikes. As we somewhat expected the last Prince of Darkness rework didn’t end up really nerfing it so much, so we are now following up with a small price nerf.

* 2xx Arcane Blast price reduced $600 -> $450
* 5xx Archmage bonus damage to MOABs 17 -> 19
* xx5 Prince of Darkness price increased from $24,000 -> 26,500

Super Monkey

Robo didn't need to lose pierce in the last Super Monkey T2 rework, and Dark Knight feels like it has too much pierce without ever considering the pierce crosspath. So to balance these together we’ve taken out pierce from Dark Knight and added it back into x2x carrying up into Robo Monkey. Dark Champion pierce is increased rather than decreased to push it further ahead of Dark Knight.

* x2x Epic Range increases pierce further 3 -> 4
* xx3 Dark Knight pierce decreased 5 -> 4
* xx4 Dark Champion pierce increased 7 -> 8

Ninja Monkey

Grand Sabotage is extremely powerful in freeplay, but really boring outside of that one scaling mechanic. For a little more flavour with the shinobi mechanic, the T5 will now boost the potential of your shinobi army.

* x5x Grand Sabotage ability grants all your Shinobi on screen +5 range
* x5x Grand Sabotage ability grants all Shinobi +1 damage to MOABs

Banana Farm

Partially to help a little with tedious endgame farm collection in ranked boss events, or any other use you may desire for it, we have added a non-power form of easy banana collection. However  we do not want to trivialize the intended downside of opting for a more micro intensive farm path too much, so this is still restricted behind a low-range tier 5 upgrade.

* xx5 Monkey Wall Street now collects nearby bananas/crates as a Monkey Farmer would

Spike Factory

To help make the tradeoff of building one T5 over multiple T4 not be as hard a choice, the basic attack on Carpet of Spikes has had power increased significantly over rate, range & damage.

* x5x Carpet of Spikes range increased from 34 -> 50
* x5x Carpet of Spikes main damage increased from 3 -> 4
* x5x Carpet of Spikes main attack delay reduced 0.98s -> 0.33

Monkey Village

Call to Arms ability suffers from uptime, for such an expensive upgrade which is such low range and purely support this makes it hard to use, so duration has now been increased to push it up to a 1/3rd uptime threshold

* x4x Call To Arms ability duration increased 12 -> 15
* x5x Homeland duration remains unchanged

Engineer

Sentry Expert really needed some logic fixes to get more of the actual correct sentries placed at the right times, it has also received a number of power buffs across the board to the special sentries at T4 complimenting the new logic reworking. Cleansing Foam has had some extra crosspath utility added at the cost of a small price increase and a large decrease to Ultraboost price.

* 4xx Sentry Expert logic has been reworked to evaluate threat levels based on Bloon types that it can counter, Bloon types that counter the sentries that it wants to spawn, and which of the current threats on screen is the greatest. Distribution of sentry types should scale based on how much one Bloon threat is more of a threat than another.
* 4xx Sentry Expert Crush Sentry ceramic damage bonus increased from 1 -> 4
* 4xx Sentry Expert Crush Sentry damage type changed from Sharp -> Shatter
* 4xx Sentry Expert Bomb Sentry damage increased 2 -> 4
* 4xx Sentry Expert Cold Sentry pierce increased from 15 -> 25
* 4xx Sentry Expert Cold Sentry radius increased from 12 -> 18
* 4xx Sentry Expert Energy Sentry gain moab damage bonus of +2
* x3x Cleansing Foam price increased from 800 -> 850
* 032 Pin allows Cleansing Foam to slow Bloons 50% briefly
* 130 Foam makes Sentries shoot Foamy nails that strip properties
* x5x Ultraboost price decreased from $120,000 -> 105,000

Gwendolin

Gwendolin’s Firestorm damage doesn’t carry well into the endgame so has been buffed at a later level.

* Lv16 Firestorm base damage tic increases from 1 > 5
* Lv16 Firestorm MOAB damage tic increases from 10 > 15

Pat Fusty

Pat Fusty was initially given a smaller footprint than it felt he should have due to concerns about balance with his small radius, but actually has been extremely powerful for a long time despite these radius issues. We feel like now giving him back the footprint size that he always should have had similar to Churchill will add a reasonable lategame downside to consider without harming his early use so badly.

* Pat Fusty footprint increased from 7 -> 8

Admiral Brickell

The Sea Mines delay that was added back in 29 has done well for reducing some of Brickells weaknesses, but as we expected somewhat does add in new weaknesses to rush rounds of Bloons that can now sneak past before all of her mines have been able to acquire a target. To help lessen this new issue she has gained a brand new ability that will allow more Sea Mines to rapidly deploy and find a target over a short duration.

* Lv7 Blast Chain utility ability added for Admiral Brickell. For 10 seconds all sea mines have their delay halved (the new one added in 29), & their projectile speed doubled

Psi

We felt that Psi’s early game too easily carried into some extremely powerful endgame setups. These setups were overperforming due to certain cooldown interactions with stalling out cooldown, however in an effort to try to avoid nerfing the cooldown for the average player we decided to make that stalling synergy harder to pull off instead.

* Psi base price increased $800 -> 1000
* Lv10 Psionic Scream ability 'speed of blow back' increased from Bloon speed 300% -> 600%

Glue Rat

Glue Rat pet has been overperforming in all game modes for a while now without any apparent weakness or strategic downsides.

* Base movement speed ramping level endures persistently
* Max level goggle tightness loosened from Max -> Sam",https://www.reddit.com/r/btd6/comments/tyq9ap/bloons_td_6_v310_update_preview_upcoming_v310/,rohan_spibo,2022-04-08 04:51:22,2723,btd6

Kyle Walker’s goodbye letter to Manchester City:,,https://i.redd.it/yj1h5i3xwzee1.jpeg,Merseez,2025-01-25 00:46:16,2701,soccer
"Damwon isn't just ""another Korean team"" They are the ultimate ""Challengers"" from Korea.","Worlds and its casters try to put them as some ""another good Korean team that are just there"" and try to portray them as ""revenge seeking Koreans"" but they really have their own narrative, and it is a good one, too.   
This will be a long one, but hear me out. This will be worth the time, if you are interested.  


Damwon gaming's name first showed up in the Challengers League (basically 2nd tier league) in 2018. However the team was founded on 2017 for Club Series(3rd tier league), and showmaker and his teammates won the Club Series 2017, winning their spot in Challengers League in 2018.   


Every step by step taken by DWG was as the Riot Games wanted how the pro-gaming scene to grow in South Korea, and they were always challenging for the very next goal that the Riot Games had in planned for them.   


Another good example of Riot Game's progamer youth system would be Wadid. He also started as Diamond support player to do well in Club Series, then to Challengers and all the way to Worlds with G2. It is almost a fairytale of how a Diamond player from Busan can go to Europe and show the world what he is capable of.   


Now back to DAMWON.   


In 2017, they started as Mirage Gaming with 5 gamers that were rather well known in high rank solo-Qs. After their first season in Club Series, they got the ticket to the Challengers League, winning vs Team Battle Comics (which also happens to join the LCK next season, winning the seat last month in the qualifiers).   


Their first season in the Challengers League was rough, to say it nicely. They weren't getting wrecked, but they weren't doing the best as well. They got the 5th place, which gave them no chance at the playoffs that season. That's how their first year ended.  


In 2018, they started strong in the Spring season, and they were definetly better. However they also had their arch-enemy, the Griffin (yeah that Griffin at the Worlds last year). They got the 2nd place in their league, but the in the playoff, they lost their chance to prove themselves, losing to the Ever Eight Winners in quarterfinals.  


Never giving up, right after Griffin made their way to the LCK, Damwon dominated the Challengers League in Summer. After winning the 1st place in the league, they also won the champion seat in the playoffs, and eventually earned the LCK seat as well, beating BBQ Olivers which that time had Ghost(current ADC of DWG) as their ADC and sending them to Challengers League.   


Even after their successful journey from 2018, they never stopped their challenge. Even though not as impactful as their ""senpai"" Griffin, they held their ground and got to the post-season playoff as the 4th place of the season. Even though they lost to Kingzone in playoff, their challenge continued to Rift Rivals where they showcased their talend brilliantly, winning against JDG with their physical and mechanical prowess and late game big fights.  


The Summer season went quite well for them, one could say, earning the 3rd place, a place higher than the last season. But the really important event that took place here is that they won the Worlds ticket after 3:2 victory against forementioned Kingzone. With the sweat smell of revenge, it felt great to be a Damwon fanboy because they are going to Worlds during their first year in LCK.  


After getting called ""scrim gods"", they didn't perform as well as their reputations had it. They indeed shown some really promising plays and aggressive playstyles, but they were a rookie team and could not handle the fast paced intellegent plays from G2. But most importantly, they learned their lesson, and never gave up. They were promising revenge against G2 the moment they went back to LCK.   


But, getting a revenge on a formidable and experienced foe like G2 isn't an easy feat. They had to figure out what they were missing, and what their weakesses were. So they struggled pretty hard during the 2020 Spring season. Earning 5th spot in LCK wasn't really what they were going for, but they constantly tested their picks, and kept honing their aggressive playstyles. That led to very entertaining series against KT and DRX which at this point is the DRX you know this year(true successor of Griffin with Chovy and CVMax). Even though they lost against DRX, DWG realized their flaws and started working on them.  


So, the curtain for the final play has risen. During their 2020 Summer season in LCK, they dominated. No other word could discribe their performances. Players comeing back from Mid Season Cup(Rift Rivals replacement regional matches) definitely improved their weaknesses. Nuguri now didn't die while pushing without solid evidence of his safety. Canyon toned down his aggression while keeping the intelligent counter jungling capabilities. Showmaker now lanes with everything in mind, coaches were amazed at how many things he thinks about even before just clearing a minion. Ghost and Beryl takes care of the stability of the team by providing ankor to rely on, and their mechanics have gotton to such higher levels that they were going toe to toe with Deft and Ruler bot lanes.   


Now they are here at the Worlds, trying to prove their ""2nd try is the charm"" magic.   
Riot Games layed out the map for Korean gamers who wanted to be the best in the world, and Damwon gaming took every step in that map, heading right towards the ultimate prize coming up to this point. From 3rd tier league to LCK in 2 years. From LCK to Worlds finals in 2 Years. Their challenging mindset and work ethic is worth the spotlight of this finals. I really hope Riot showcases this for all the ""wannabe Pros"" as the fine example of the path they carved and dedication they had shown.  


I hope the trophy goes to the better team this weekend, but I just wanted to tell people how Damwon Gaming climbed this ladder with their perserverence and hard work, through trial and error and learning from failures. This team is the true testement to LCK way of improving.

My name is Nelle Lockwood and if you’re just joining us, I’m The Last Sin Eater. [You can find out more about me here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tjaylea/comments/ihl3ly/new_to_the_subreddit_want_to_findread_the/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) I just dealt with the subtle evil that was Sloth. Now I’m on my way to dealing with a far more pressing issue; someone taking my friends hostage and holding them to ransom.

The wait in the elevator was excruciating. It had always been long, but had it always been \*this\* long? I couldn’t tell, but with every passing floor and stream of light rushing through the tube window, my anxiety built upon itself. The elevator may as well have been filled with water up to my neck for how much I paced, thrashed and ruminated on the worst.

After an age, the doors cluttered open, and I stormed towards central, a stoic Warden waiting for me with his sleeves up and hands in his pockets.

“Ah! Frau Lockwood, danke for getting here so quickly, I was most concerned you’d be held up by th-”

I breezed past him to the view in front of me, a large plexiglass screen that displayed the carnage down below in an extra large enclosure; bodies on pikes, split open and hollowed out of their organs, teeth smashed inwards to the gums, noses removed from faces and barely any living soul amid the sea of inmates ripped to pieces.

That is, of course, aside from the man situated at the end of a great circular table. He was gigantic, but not in the way Tallulah, the woman who represented Lust was. His weight was, for the most part, distributed better. Thighs were like tree trunks, arms great hulking amorphous bulges of muscle, his barrel chest stretching out to double my own width, a great beard flowing down to his navel. His stomach shivered and rumbled incessantly as he took mounds of food from his plate and shovelled them into a huge mouth, making horrific sounds with his mouth. Vile lip smacking and tongue licking against the vestiges of food in his mouth without care or concern for decorum. Despite the window, I could hear every bite down, every chew, swallow and spittle.

But it was when I saw his plate that the fear set in, knowing full well this one was going to be different to the others.

It was stained in dark blood, a piece of leg still uneaten but barely anything left amid the surrounding bones. He peered down with frustration, pushing his chair back to walk over to a poor soul on a makeshift pike in the corner, thankfully not impaled yet, but instead chained to it by the top, partially obscured by the poor lighting.

“You’ve got 60 seconds to get down here, or I take a piece of him for my protein workout.” The low, northern English voice called out, his massive fist reaching for the person’s leg. As they resisted, I saw Nestor’s defiant eyes look up at me and shake his head.

“Don’t, he just wants you for- AGH!”

Blood streamed from his stomach as sharp claws dug in and took a pound of flesh, the larger man holding it above his widening jaws and swallowing in one go, a small trickle of blood rushing down his chin.

“Times already started love, hurry up.”

I turned on my heel and made a beeline for the stairs as The Warden walked with me, shoving a document into my hands.

“Inmate #5933 is Cyril Monks, former underground fighting champion and dealer of a killer drug “Thanatos”, he’s a master manipulator and takes what he wants. I do not advise you go in there without our usual protection, Frau Lockwood. The risks it poses you and the prison are substantial.” He pleaded, barely keeping pace with me as we reached the final hallway connecting us to Monks’ cell.

“Fuck the risks. Fuck the prison. He wants a face-to-face interview? He’ll get one. He should know not to underestimate any of us. I’ll look to you to take a shot if anything goes wrong, Warden.”  I looked at him, a reassuring grin on my face. “I didn’t get this far by being a pretty face, I can gut a motherfucker if I need to.” He swallowed and nodded.

When I turned back, for the briefest of moments, I saw something on the leftmost guard. His hat drew down low and a salute as we walked past, towards the door.

At least, I thought it was a salute. His fingers were drawn at the brim of his hat, but something was off… there weren’t the usual four with the thumb tucked in.

He lifted his head and for a split second; the hand drew down and in front of me, a familiar maniacal grin plastered on his face that burned its way into my skull, the number on his hand doing just the same as I passed through to the enclosure;

**“Three.”**

\-

The first scent I picked up was iron, so much blood and viscera around me, it was impossible not to.

“They had me waiting with some lower-risk inmates. Thought because I was on good behaviour that I’d do my bit to get better privileges. Even gave me visitation for 9 years of no incidents. Imagine their shock when I started pulling limbs from bodies. Cunts never stood a chance, bless ‘em.” He rested back on the chair, his makeshift lunch table splattered with blood. “C’mon, take a seat, we’ve got much to discuss.”

I looked at the back end of the room and saw Buck and Nestor on either side, both bloodied and beaten, but not dead or mortally wounded. Breathing a small sigh of relief, I sat down on the opposite end and put my papers down, prepping to introduce myself.

“You know who I am, I know who you are, so let’s not pussyfoot around, eh? I have a way of doing things and you are no exception, Miss Lockwood. If we do this, it’s on my terms.” He breezed through my introduction as if it was nothing, pulling a dumbbell from the floor and flexing as he spoke. “I will ask you a series of questions and if you answer the way I want you to, you can ask one back. Answer wrong and…” he threw his hand back, thumb pointed towards my two boys. “I’ll take a piece of ‘em. Literally.”

My hands shook, and I felt a lump in my throat. He wasn’t joking. Reluctantly, I smiled and nodded, not enjoying the lack of control I had over this situation.

“Good. So, what can ya tell me about your upbringing, Nellie?” He leaned back in his chair, imposing frame bearing down on the rickety joints and hands folded over his stomach.

“First 11 years of my life were good, things were simple at home but pleasant. Mum worked hard and was always busy, but never stopped making time for me no matter what it was. Bakery, nature walks, finding and identifying the animals in the woods nearby or whatever else, Mum never stopped trying. Then, I turned 12 and things began to change…” I pursed my lips, those painful memories rising to the surface. Arguments, slammed doors, misunderstandings. Typical teenage things that are supposed to be fractals in your life and not the final definitive moments of your last days with your Mother. “Well, things were never the same after that. Then, one day, she told me to stay at home while she took a work call. Never came back, and I was looked after by my Grandparents. Here we are.” I shrugged and shook my head, hating that I was telling all of this to an animal in this prison.

“Good, good. You seem to get it. Ask away.” He chuckled, finishing his rep and going onto the other arm.

“What drove you to being this way? How does a legitimate bodybuilder and family man, according to your file, begin distributing a powerful new drug and tearing people limb from limb?” I furtively scanned over the notes, determined not to take my eyes off of him for too long. He smiled, bright white teeth stained with red.

“Adephagia. Or Adi, if you know her. I tore my ACL and MCL, docs said it’d take 18 months to get back to any kind of work. That meant watching my colleagues progress beyond me, get bigger and stronger, achieve all the shit that was MINE to achieve. Less money, less power, less interest.” He shook his head, getting up and grabbing a pair of human spines on the floor with some rope attached, using it as a macabre skipping rope as he carried on talking. “I got sick of it. My anger and desire grew into something more and I overheard some boys talking about this new kind of Steroid: Thanatos. Fuckers said it was a reawakening in the system, but you had to know the right people to get it. I may have been on crutches, but I still beat the silly cunts until they gave up the info. Met the guy in a supermarket car park at 4am, paid him what I had left of my savings and he dashed off, barely seeing his face in all the excitement. That’s where things...changed.” He finished skipping, the scraping of the vertebrae on the floor making me nauseous.

A thick, pungent golden mist began forming around his body, but he paid it no mind if he knew it was there.

“Your turn. Can you smell and taste your own sins? Do you know what lurks deep within your soul?” He chuckled, grabbing a handful of meat from under the table, opening his mouth before closing it and looking at me quizzically. “Oh, you don’t mind if I dine while we whine? Haha…” shoving it in his mouth with those abhorrent mukbang sounds even louder as I spoke.

“A lot of people have asked that, but the truth is I sense nothing. Whenever I go into meditation and focus on myself, I can smell, taste, feel nothing of my own sins… though I know they’re there.”

He shoved his chair firmly away from the table, scowling as he walked over to Buck. Holding out his hand at the wrist. Buck was barely conscious as his head rocked around from the jerking motion.

“I warned you about lying, Nellie.” he hissed, roaring as he bit down hard on Buck’s entire hand, severing it at the bone as a blood-curdling scream rang out. Cyril doing nothing but savouring the bites and singing the same pitch as Bucks pain addled yells.

I drew my knife, hot blood running through my veins.

“I will fucking end you, right here and now.”

But he sat down, acting as if all he’d done was kick over a chair, shaking his head and savouring the last bites of Buck’s hand and fingers, crushed between diamond strength molars.

“Nope, you won’t. I’m not interested in anything that isn’t my own, but I value my life above any of your sad little existences. You so much as get within 5 feet and I will bite more desirable parts of Buck off, then start at Nestors legs. Not only are you going to tell the truth on your last statement, but you’re going to answer another question as penance. So, try again.”

I slammed the table, yelling and trying to catch my breath, failing in the process.

“I… Yes, yes, okay I once saw my sin. It was cloaked in black, smelled of my mother’s cooking and tasted of… nothing. It had a total absence. But I could see it. And it... “

“It looked like the thing that plagues your nightmares? Yes, I know. Thank you. Do you love Buck?” He said, licking his lips and walking over to a pair of intact corpses hanging from the rafters, punching them as if they were sides of beef to practice boxing on. Swift, precise punches raining down on the poor souls. Anger gave way to embarrassment and a slew of complex emotions. My initial response was to ask how that was his business, to deflect or give a half answer. But that wouldn’t do. This was not a time for complacency or half measures.

“With everything I hold dear. But not just a romantic love. A love that transcends the physical. He was my mentor as a young woman, he treated me like an equal and looks to ME for advice now. He’s everything to me. Which makes what you did a moment ago that much more egregious in my eyes.” I paused, taking a breath and resigning to deal with the aftermath later, thankful in part that Buck had passed out from shock so I was spared the embarrassment. “Now, tell me what brought you here, in full.”

Left hook, right hook, uppercut, knee to the groin. Cyril Monk was incessant in his onslaught, as if he had something to prove.

“I tried Thanatos that night. First dosage straight to the veins and it sent a surge through my body that I swear gave me a bloody heart attack. When my senses returned, I was clearly out of it. Stood in this great marble hall that had statues of the greatest warriors and baddest motherfuckers living or dead. At the end, Adi stood. Huge woman, muscled and big in all the right places, stronger than I could ever hope to be. Big jaws on her stomach and a tail the size of my entire body with a hungry mouth at the end. She told me if I could defeat 7 other men, take something from them AND defeat her, she’d help me ascend to that true state of power. Of dominance. Not a single thing out of my grasp.” He volleyed off one last right hook, the ribs of the body caving in and blood spraying over his face, he lapped it up with zest. “Was easy enough to beat them when I had motivation and a controlled dosage of Thanatos. Even got to such good terms with the guy who sold it to me, I distributed it for him as his muscle. Few fights later, we had desperate dope fiends with a lot of strength and no money; so the fight game was born. Another way to take and grow…”

He walked over to the table, his stomach growling as he clutched it. The thick yellow aura growing on his body.

“But, I began to crave food. Started out simple enough, get a takeaway or an extra meal prep. But then my stomach started rejecting it, refusing all but one thing that rested at my feet with every fight. Flesh…” His eyes grew wide and manic, pupils enlarging before he coughed and reached under the table for another helping of some poor person’s still warm corpse. “I made ‘em sign a contract with me before fighting that not only was it to the death, but I could take whatever I wanted if I won. Desperate little cunts were all too eager to sign themselves away. Few choice shots to vital organs, they’d go down and be in that beautiful state between this world and the next. Unable to fight back but heart still pumping hot blood out. Delicious.”

“And one of those bodies became your undoing, I assume?” I pressed, but he held a hand up.

“Not your turn. Tell me what was on that paper.” He said it so matter-of-factly that the obvious nearly passed me by.

“But that was… how did you…” I breathed. He seemed willing to permit this surprise as he leaned forward and pulled something from his plate, holding it up to my face.

A black feather.

“A little birdy told me. Seems he was watching you from afar to protect you. When he heard his papa was here, he went on ahead to protect him and got caught. I tell you, not a big fan of chicken, but I’ll go off-menu once in a while!” He bellowed with laughter as tears filled my eyes. “I asked you a question, Nellie. I won’t let you avoid it again.”

All I could see was Edgar. His laughing, constant interruptions, rude quips and that lasting image of him curled up in Nestor’s arms, softly cawing and saying “Papa” over and over. No, no, I had to press it down and push on. I had to. I had to for him.

“The daughter of the high priestess brings the dawn with her and the dusk in her absence. The cycle will ring anew at her hands.

Her offering is that of her eternal servitude to guide others.

E Dolore Magna Gloria.” -

The thick aura began slithering its way down Cyril’s body, enrapturing his muscles and his barrel chest. The smell of sulphur and burnt lard began making my eyes water, but I moved past it. Pausing to catch my breath and asking a question burning in the back of my skull.

“Why did you want this to be face to face, Cyril?”

He rose up out of his seat and instead of maneuvering to another body or exercise machine; he took strides towards me and reached out an arm, a hand as big as my face coming ever closer. For a moment, I thought he was going to smash me into the wall, pick me up and devour me or worse…

But instead, his large digits brushed the side of my face and his deadened eyes glazed over, a soft smile covering his face.

“Because I wanted to prove to you that I can always get what I want. One way or another.” His fingers found their way to my throat and tightened around it with ease, veins pumping on his wrist as he lifted me off the ground with barely any effort. I was seeing spots within seconds, his blurry expression changing back to that of pure malice and hunger.

“Do you fear me, Nellie?” His voice cooed. This close I could see the aura undulating around him, shaking to the very touch. I blinked twice and tried to nod, barely able to make any proper movements save for the errant kicking of my legs, desperate to find footing.

He smiled and dropped me in a heap; I gasped for air and felt my windpipe against the wall of my throat. He’d definitely considered just killing me there and then. He took his seat and looked at something behind me.

“Looks like it’s almost time. Last question, Nellie. Make it a good one.”

I thought on what he’d told me, how he’d gotten injured, the drug abuse and eventual supply, fighting and devouring pieces of his opponents… then I remembered something on the paper The Warden gave me. Something that turned my stomach.

“What happened the night you were captured, Cyril? They say you were naught but skin and bones, shaking and convulsing from the drug. You must have gotten to this size in here, no? Tell me how you came to be one of the most feared men in this prison.”

I was shaking, adrenaline pumping through me, terrified out of my mind as neurons fired to think of other ways to stall or escape. But this was it. I had to stick to it.

Monks seemed to consider my question, looking down at his hands and frowning before getting up and pacing the far corner.

“I’d grown accustomed to taking pieces of my trophies home. What wasn’t offered to Adephagia in that drug fuelled realm was kept for my own enjoyment. But I needed to find a more efficient way of eating at home. My wife was becoming suspicious of my constant eating out and I hoped by bringing them into that world, they’d accept it and see the good it did me. So, I offered to cook one evening for the whole family, whole spread on just to show my love and appreciation. They ate it all with relish, said it was succulent meat and very moreish… I was overjoyed. So much so that I told them what it was there and then.” He turned back to me, genuine sadness in his eyes. “Things didn’t go as planned. My wife lost her senses, began screaming about how I wasn’t the kind, considerate and driven man I was before the accident. Couldn’t recognise me anymore and that she was leaving. My wife was… different to other people. I couldn’t lay a finger on her, so when she said she needed some space with the kids, I gave it to her. Went upstairs to think, knew she couldn’t very well tell the police anything that’d implicate her and risk losing the kids.”

He stopped pacing, shoulders heaving under the weight of his words.

“I must’ve been on a comedown from Thanatos because I passed out and saw Adephagia again, laughing at me. Each of the mouths on her stomach and tail, laughing in kind, mocking me and biting at my torn muscles. When I woke up, I saw smoke in the house. Following it to the garage, my wife and children were in the car, eyes open and staring into the ether… dead. She’d left four words on a furiously scribbled note in the kitchen: Never forgive. Never forget.”

He sighed and shook his head, pinching his nose.

“I tried to OD on Thanatos that night, stood before Adephagia with no tributes left and no more ways to climb those hallowed steps. She looked on me with pity and said when I awoke, I’d have a new purpose; capture and kill the greatest warrior I’d ever face; Nelle fucking Lockwood. So here we are, at the end of it all. No more sins for you to speak to. I’m your last stop.”

He walked towards me, the surrounding aura was nearly fully over his body and I was out of time.

That’s when a thought hit me.

“You ate Edgar, didn’t you, Mr Monks? Swallowed him whole with no further thought?” I couldn’t help but feel a smile ripple across my face. He stopped, dumbfounded.

“I told you that already, Nellie. I also told you no more questions, so you’ll have the pleasure of seeing more suffering before it’s over.” He made a beeline for Buck when I burst out laughing. It was a genuine, elated laugh that comes after you find something you lost and the anger, grief and anxiety gives way.

“You… you stupid man. You really think he’s dead, don’t you? That the things you eat disappear and you don’t have to deal with them anymore? God, I’m so stupid for not even realising it sooner!” I laughed harder, tears in my eyes. His face fell and lips parted to show gritted teeth.

“What the fuck do you know, eh? I’ve taken this meeting where I wanted it to go. I will have your flesh before this is all said and done. What does it matter if he’s alive or dead?”

“It matters plenty, Mr. Monks. You ate a creature in servitude to Lady Death. You ate something that, while innocuous, is not from this world. He’s pernicious, irritating, rude and at times downright a pain in my ass. But he is a member of this group and full of many surprises. I’d also wager he’s very VERY hungry right now. Surprised you haven’t felt him rummaging around in there, to be honest! But you will when I call out his name.”

I felt a surge of power and malice run through me, as if I had the whole world in my hands. I took confident steps in front of his towering mass of muscle and saw him grow pale, shaking hands clutching at his stomach as it began to twist and gurgle.

“Edgar. Allen. Crow.” I bellowed, watching this powerful man double over in agony on the floor at the mere mention, pained moans coming from his mouth as he bent over. “I’ll never forgive Nestor for giving him that fucking name…” I hissed under my breath, walking round Cyril like a Lioness in front of her prey.

“Pl-please… not like this.” He whimpered, drool running down his beard with blood. Whatever Edgar was doing, it was efficient. I pulled him up by his beard to look at me, ushering him to lean back onto his knees and placing my hand on his face, the exact same way he did to me.

“You know what they call a flock of crows, Mr. Cyril?” I asked, placing one hand behind his head, my other pulling my serrated blade from my belt, driving it into the left of his belly and drawing it across the length with a powerful swipe.

“They call it a murder.” I replied, the stench of his stomach horrifying as Edgar flew out, covered in all manner of giblets and blood, cawing as he soared around the building.

**“MURDER. MURDER FAT MAN. PAPA'S BOY LIVES.”** He screeched, laughing as he flew to Nestor’s side, cawing softly at his unconscious body.

The aura covering Cyril glowed brighter and sank into his flesh; the body shrinking and losing muscle mass before my eyes. Within a few minutes, he was barely anything but a skeletal frame with his stomach torn open.

Sitting back at the table within a stone’s throw of him, a plate of chicken wings, Aberdeen angus steak, sausages, beans, eggs, toast and bacon waited for me. I knew there was no trick, no rotting food or human substitute this time. Just pure, delicious, carnivorous food. I was going to savour it.

I took my first bite, and the sound of a screaming pig filled the room. Raw and visceral, it was enough to shake anyone to their core, but my resolve was strong. I relished every bite and as I made my way through the breakfast, each new bite adding a scream to the choir of suffering creatures.

I looked straight ahead the entire time, ignoring the sound of Cyril crawling towards me and begging, weakly, for a morsel of food or another shot of Thanatos.

Only when his hand touched my thigh did I look at him, mid-bite of a sausage.

“I need… I need to see her again. I know how this works, you see my sin in physical form and I go with them to ascend… Can’t get rid of me until then… Please…” his eyes were sinking into his gaunt face, the beard now brittle and patchy, teeth yellowing and falling out. I scoffed and bit down hard on the sausage, the juices spraying in front of him.

“Your sin was so powerful, so full of desire, that it manifested around you and ate itself. You didn’t wonder why you ballooned up and then deflated so quick? You are the ouroboros, Mr. Monks. You feed upon yourself in the end. Or, perhaps, there’s a better way to say this… let me think…” I turned away again and saw Edgar watching me, head cocked to the side and undoubtedly observing the best tactic to steal from me. I pulled a piece of my egg away and threw it into Cyril’s open cavity.

As expected, he dove straight in, rummaging up through Cyril’s organs and causing him ungodly damage and pain in the process.

But after the way he’d toyed with me, used information against me and put my loved ones through hell, I was unphased. Perhaps I had ascended in my own way, grown a tad. I also knew The Warden was watching, I wanted him to see that I was no longer going to play any games. Not for our last two sins.

This whole prison would know not to fuck with Nelle Lockwood.

As I finished my last few bites and the death rattles of Cyril Monks faded with the agonised screams of the animals I’d eaten, I made sure he heard one last prophetic phrase before he left this world. Getting out of my seat, I stood over him on my way to rescue my friends.

*“That which is gluttonous may eternal lie.And even in strange aeons, even you may die.”*

Anti-Revisionism Zinedine Zidane Thread,"**A defence of Zidane's historical position against common misconceptions propogated by stat obsessed revisionists**


> Zidane never showed anything near the display of tactical intelligence possessed by M. Laudrup, and Iniesta. He was never the best at making key passes, organizing the midfield and was a bit of a ballhog. In 98 France, this was compensated by Deschamps who organized the midfield, and in Juve and RM, he had several other world-class players to tactically organize the game when needed, like Conte, Davids, Figo, Hierro, even compatriot Makelele. Nedved himself, brought to Juve to replace Zidane, played better for them between 2003 and 2005 than Zizou ever did. People who never watched him week after week forget that.


The fact that Zidane played with DMs isn't exactly a concrete example of any tactical ineptness on his part, since he was a classic 10. The role is kind of lost on the current generation who is used to watching teams play 4-3-3s, but to surmise, a player playing such a role in those days was actually given the task of controlling the tempo of the game and moving the ball vertically/horizontally as required, from a tactical perspective. The DMs were generally used to stop the opposition from playing by recovering balls and cycling them back to their own number 10, to start a new chain of playmaking. Hence the term 'water carrier' as used by Cantona for Deschamps.

Furthermore, if Zidane was indeed so tactically limited, then I really doubt that he would be consistently asked to play such a tactically crucial role (without being dropped mind you for big games, unlike for instance Laudrup who was famously dropped for the 94CL final by a coach like Cruyff) for teams being coached by managers who are themselves considered to be very adept tacticians i.e. guys like Lippi, Ancellotti, etc. One would think, they would notice these fallacies in Zidane's game. Oh, and it isn't as if Zidane never featured in such a role in a big game, since he played as a deep lying playmaker/dm for Juventus in their demolition of Milan at the San Siro in the 96/97 season. It's just that Lippi soon figured out that Zidane was even better as a classic 10.

As for the anecdote regarding Nedved, well, when Zidane left for Real Madrid, Juventus used that money to not only buy Nedved, but Buffon and Thuram as well (so it wasn't just Nedved's effect which helped them achieve success). And even after that, they still reached only one CL final vs the two reached during Zidane's time. Domestically as well, in both their tenures Juventus have 2 Serie A titles (since the other 2 for Nedved were revoked due to Calciopoli, but then Zidane's Juventus ended up losing 2 Serie A titles i.e. in 99/00 and 00/01, in controversial circumstances on the last day of each of those two seasons as well, so it evens out).  


> After his 2006 sendoff his popularity with casual and new football fans exploded, alongside thousands of youtube highlight reels showcasing his godly first touch and ball control. And this retroactively built a Zidane vs Brazilian Ronaldo manufactured rivalry, when everyone that actively watched football in the 90s knows that Ronaldo was miles above Zidane at the time, and the comparisons between them are actually between Zidane and post-injury Ronaldo.


Zidane v Ronaldo started in 97/98, wherein they competed for the Serie A and World Cup titles. Guess who won both of them, and no R9 was not injured in the Serie A that season but the next, though he did suffer from that seizure during the World Cup final. And yes, obviously the 2006 World Cup helped Zidane's popularity and his performance against Brazil was a major influence on fans watching at that time, but that was simply a result of the improbability of it, considering that a 34 year old bossed a game involving a 2 time former Ballon d'Or winner, the reigning Ballon d'Or winner and the soon to be anointed Ballon d'Or winner. So the rivalry wasn't manufactured post retirement, but was a product of the two best players of that generation being pitted against one another in two separate world cups and a league campaign.

Lastly, there was a time before Ronaldo got injured when he was absolutely unplayable and definitely and rightly considered the best player in the world, above even Zidane. But it is also true that at that time Zidane was not at his peak yet, which he reached during the 2000-2002 period. Sadly, Ronaldo was injured by then and thus a direct comparison of the players at their peaks was never made possible.


> He's often credited for the 98 WC even though he played average, was sent off in the group stage and only hit 2 headers from set pieces in the final. People are fooled by his elegant game, but older fans know that he did absolutely nothing up to the Final, and Djorkaeff was widely regarded as France's most dangerous player. In club football, he's often remembered for the volley against Leverkusen and RM highlight compilations, but what they don't show is that Zidane never, ever had a single truly proficient season where he shined throughout. On this regard, Iniesta is a much more consistent player the team can always rely on.


For a player who didn't do much in world cup 98, it surely is surprising that he was the highest rated offensive player (2nd highest overall behind Thuram) with minimum 5 games played, by kicker magazine (a relatively dependable source for NT tournament player ratings) for the 98 World Cup. Source - http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/w...er-saison.html or that the Argentinean EL Grafico magazine considered him to be their player of the tournament. Source - http://www.bigsoccer.com/threads/how...#post-28566702

As for entire seasons where Zidane shined throughout, you can have your pick of 95/96 (33 goals+assists out of 88 goals scored by the team) , 00/01 (20 goals+assists out of 72 goals scored by the team) and 02/03 (29 goals+assists out of 141 goals scored by his team). His teams might have ended up short on trophies in those seasons, except in case of 02/03 when they won La Liga, but statistically, his impact on his team's goalscoring in those seasons is easily comparable to the consistent best that Iniesta can offer. And in case of seasons wherein Zidane played for offensively weaker teams, it actually makes his contributions more valuable to his team's fortunes.


> He's somehow credited as a ""big game player"" even though he only showed up for 2 finals in his whole career, and went invisible in most of the others:
>>  1996 UEFA cup final - invisible, gets destroyed at home, team loses  
    1997 CL final - invisible, his team loss (the same team that had won it in 1996 without him)  
    1998 CL final - invisible, his team loses  
    1998 WC final - clutch, scores 2 headers from set pieces after being average the entire tournament, team wins  
    2000 Euro final - invisible, team wins because he's bailed out by Wiltord and Trezeguet (Zidane not involved in their goals)  
    2002 CL final - clutch, team wins  
    2002 CdR final - invisible, team loses  
    2004 CdR final - invisible, team loses against a lower mid table side  
    2006 WC final - chokes and gets sent off, team loses  


All that the above list shows is that if Zidane didn't absolutely take control and win the final for his team by scoring goals, they generally lost it (apart from the Euro 00 final and even there he had better overall stats than both Henry and Totti, both of whom are considered to have had a better game than him by his detractors and were the respective motms for their teams). Which shows how the ""he always played with superior teammates"" argument is also a bit of a fallacy (at least for cup finals).

In any case, if you hold say Xavi to that same scale, for instance, and give him the same handicap with regards to his teammates, he would have a lot lesser volume of major trophies to show for all his brilliant play, considering that he never scored in any major final. Point is, that you have to understand that Zidane was a midfielder, and so scoring was not always possible for him. And if his teammates also did not score from the chances he provided for them, it was hardly his fault. He was definitely not ""invisible"" in all those games you listed, as for instance I pointed out in case of Euro 00, or as is the case for the 97 CL final wherein he hit the post and also had a pre-assist. Thus there are some clear hyperboles in that above mentioned list almost like saying Xavi was invisible for the WC 2010 final.

For your reference, below is a list of big game goals by Zidane -


Stage        Tournament         Year Goals  
Final	        European Cup	2002	1  
Semi Final	European Cup	2003	1  
Semi Final	European Cup	2002	1  
Semi Final	European Cup	1998	1  
Semi Final	European Cup	1997	1  
Semi Final	Euro                 2000	1

Final	        World Cup	        1998	2  
Semi Final	World Cup	        2006	1  

Source - http://www.averageopposition.com/201...-findings.html , which is a blog that has a compilation of players' goals scored in major international tournament finals and semi finals and awards points accordingly to said players (Zidane is 5th in that list btw).


In addition to the above, below is a list of his indirect goal involvements in big games drawn as per the same criteria as above,  
So, if you consider direct assists as per the big games that the blog is counting, he has,  
1 vs Slavia Prague in the SF in E3 1996  
2 vs Ajax in E1 in the SF in E1 1997  
1 vs Manchester United in the SF in E1 1999  
1 vs Barcelona in the SF in E1 2002  


And, if you also consider pks won, pre-assists and setups, all leading to goals, he has,  
1 setup vs Ajax in the SF in E1 1997  
1 pre-assist vs Borussia Dortmund in the F in E1 1997  
1 pk won vs Monaco in the SF in E1 1998  
1 setup vs Croatia in the SF in WC 1998  
1 pre-assist vs Manchester United in E1 1999  


The above are from my own memory, so if you want to cross check, best to try and find the video highlights of the respective games.

In any case, the above together come to 20 goals he was a contributor to in 23 games in the Semis and Finals of the major international tournaments that he featured in. That's more than either Xavi or Iniesta and approximately close to what Messi's numbers look like, from what I recollect as having counted (cannot find the post right now), when looking at their goal involvement across a similar criteria of games.


> Another little known fact: Zidane only ever gave 1 assist to Henry in their entire tenure with the France NT. And it was from a set piece. This is supposed to be the playmaker that defined a generation? No, I don't think so. He played his whole career as a bona fide #10, but he has a pitiable goal+assist/game ratio that doesn't even compare to modern #10s like James Rodríguez (ironically), De Bruyne, Fabregas and Ozil, let alone the true greats of yesteryear, like his contemporaries Nedved, Rivaldo, Del Piero, Ronaldo or Figo, who all put up far superior contributions to their teams in all of goals, assists, actual playmaking, be it from the center or from the wing. To put numbers to a single example, which I selected because of the similar amount of games:
>> Zidane  
played 231 times in 5 seasons for Real Madrid, always as an AM  
scored 49 goals, including 9 in the CL/Supercup  
made 51 assists, including 10 in the CL/Supercup  
played 108 times for France though his career, with 31 goals (including penalties) and 29 assists  
Rivaldo  
played 235 times in 5 seasons for Barcelona, as an LW (which he disliked) and as an AM  
scored 130 goals, including 31 (THIRTY ONE) in the CL/Supercup  
made 50 assists, including 6 in the CL/Supercup  
played 79 times for Brazil, with 37 goals and 18 assists, not a penalty-taker  


First of all, Zidane did not always play as an AM for RM. Especially during 03/04 and 04/05, he was mostly forced out wide (to the left), to accomodate Beckham in the center of midfield, since Figo would not relinquish his right midfield spot, even though he could play on the left side almost just as well. Rivaldo on the other hand played as a forward as well as an AM and sometimes a LW.


Secondly, he did not take all PKs and FKs for Real Madrid, or even most of them, unlike Rivaldo did for Barcelona. Figo took almost all of them, leaving a tiny amount for Zidane, thus drastically impacting his goal numbers as well as assist numbers. Also, Rivaldo did take pks for Brazil e.g., he took the regular time pks against Russia, Uruguay, Turkey and Peru (off the top of my head), so saying he was not a penalty taker for his country is quite the lie. In fact, I find it worrying that the pk point is mentioned for Zidane when he had all of 19 career PKs while it is not mentioned for Rivaldo who had 65 (both including PSOs).


Thirdly, the French NT unlike the Brazilian was not setup to score goals, but was primarily a defensive side. This hindered Zidane's goal and assist output at an NT level.


Considering the above handicaps, Zidane actually did quite well for himself in terms of the numbers he put up, especially at NT level.


Lastly, for the case with Henry, there are a few things that need to be considered,  
1) Zidane did assist Henry during the Euro 00 as well, in addition to doing it in WC 06, though the first one was a goal more made by Henry dribbling than the pass from Zidane, which was routine  
2) Apart from those assists though, there were a number of opportunities that Zidane provided to Henry which he couldn't capitalise on when playing for the French NT. Ten of these are listed here (although there are definitely more) - http://www.bigsoccer.com/threads/cri...#post-31340027  
3) Zidane's playmaking had a pronounced indirect effect on Henry's scoring, in that it enabled the same. This can be seen if we look at the matches played by Henry from his debut till his 85th cap (vs Italy in WC 06, when Zidane retired), and look at his gpg while playing with Zidane and without Zidane,  


Games featuring both Henry & Zidane - Games 56* / Henry Goals 25 / Henry GPG 0.45  
Games featuring Henry but not Zidane - Games 29 / Henry Goals 11 / Henry GPG 0.38  


Considering the same numbers as above only for NT tournaments,  


Games featuring both Henry & Zidane - Games 18/ Henry Goals 10/ Henry GPG 0.55  
Games featuring Henry but not Zidane - Games 6 / Henry Goals 1 / Henry GPG 0.17  


Sources -  
http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/henry-intlg.html  
http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/zidane-intl.html  


So during the time that Zidane was active i.e. till Henry's 85th cap, Henry had a significantly better gpg with him in the team than without him there and this was even more pronounced when playing in NT tournaments.

Thus ultimately, in case of the Zidane-Henry partnership, Zidane definitely did do enough to get more assists for Henry and was also definitely a positive influence on Henry's goalscoring, especially in major NT tournaments. 


> Yet somehow, all this highlights-based revisionism twists Zidane into somehow a better, more productive, more efficient, more legendary player than Rivaldo - a player with EIGHTY goals more than Zidane in a similar time-frame, playing in the same position. The exact same evaluation can be made for Totti (a MUCH better playmaker than Zidane ever was, whose passing, goals/assists tally and capacity to run a game at his prime were like three whole levels above Zizou's), Figo (also a much better playmaker, whose record of La Liga assists wasn't broken until Messi), Del Piero and Nedved (both better for Juve than Zidane ever was), Rui Costa (who was better in Serie A than Zidane, particularly for Fiorentina) and many, many other great, even better players who were simply marginalized by Zidane's two WC goals in the 98 Final, which FIFA and UEFA saw as an opportunity to market and big-up Zidane as some sort of Europe's answer to Ronaldo - his post-WC poster-boyism, his natural skill and elegance in ball control and his later move to the original Galacticos Madrid lending credibility to this marketing campaign. His 1998 FIFA WPOTY and Ballon D'or were based simply on that one game, completely disregarding how he was invisible during the CL Final against Real Madrid in the same year or in all the other games of that very same World Cup. Of course, statistics are not the be-all end-all, but Zidane's lack of tactical nous, famous inconsistence (as great managers have said, ""inconsistence"" is just a lack of tactical knowledge and application. the best tacticians are always the most consistent players) and lack of awareness for the final pass put him just way too far behind other top #10s to disregard the gap between them.


The above, as far as I can tell, is a bit of a rant with,  
1) Some really odd opinions, for instance, Totti's playmaking at his prime being 3 whole levels above Zidane, is something that I am not even sure is supposed to have any meaning, since it is impossible to calculate or measure in any way; or Del Piero and Nedved both being better for Juve than Zidane, though both together couldn't achieve as much at a continental level as Zidane did with just one of them, while having a similar domestic impact.  
2) Or inane stat bashing, for instance Rivaldo/Figo are mentioned to have better goal tallies and assist tallies respectively. Well that's like saying that Iniesta is a poor player because during that same era, Ozil had a better assist tally and Rooney had a better goal tally. What I'm trying to point out is that Ozil takes almost all set-pieces for his teams, and does less playmaking and more final ball passing while Rooney plays as a forward just as often as he plays as a playmaker, unlike Iniesta, which helps these players improve their stats compared to Iniesta. Just like Figo and Rivaldo could do, when compared to Zidane. In big international games wherein their teams met though, like in the WC 98 or Euro 00, it was Zidane who came out on top with some top-drawer performances. And that makes the difference between era defining players and the rest.  
3) And ultimately ending with the same inconsistency related Zidane bashing that I have addressed elsewhere in this post


> Last but not least, the folks at Big Soccer have put together a very interesting compilation on Zidane's performances, trying to list all of his matches based on the ratings the press assigned to that week's game, with corresponding videos when available:

Those who, unlike the older folks like me (30+), didn't see him week in, week out, this is a place as good as any to see how damned inconsistent, erratic and unspectacular he could be.


I was part of this rating exercise and first of all it was only done for 2 seasons i.e. 96/97 and 97/98. Furthermore, the ""ratings"" used are from a couple of Italian magazines which are unduly harsh on Zidane, especially when compared to how they rated homegrown talent like Del Piero.


For more non-partisan ratings, democratically compiled by getting voted upon, ESM is a good source. ESM stands for European Sports Media and it is a forum of media outlets wherein they vote for and come out with monthy teams for club football performances. This started from 95/96 onwards. Messi and CRonaldo who are generally considered to have been very consistent, lead the pack with the most appearances for the current era, as well as overall. Guess who leads for the era during the time that Zidane played? Well overall it is Carlos who is way ahead of the pack at 34, and behind him on 2nd it is indeed Zidane with 24 appearances, who is also the offensive player (more difficult to get on the list than defensive players, for whom consistency is more easy to display) with the highest number of appearances for that era. Here is the list of teams between 95/96 and 07/08 - http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/esm-xi.html. The player totals should be at this link (2011) - http://www.bigsoccer.com/threads/esm...month.1693535/


Furthermore, if we look at Zidane's teammates when he was playing for his strongest club teams, and compare their performances with his by looking at ESM appearances, it becomes obvious who was the most consistent out of the lot,


ESM Season XI, Zidane and Club Teammates' Comparison -  

Juventus  
96-97: Del Piero(3), Deschamps(3), Fererra(3), Zidane(2), Peruzzi(2), Boksic(1), Vieri(1), Di Livio(1)  
97-98: Zidane(5), Peruzzi(3), Del Piero(2), Inzaghi(1)  
98-99: None  
99-00: Zidane(2), Montero(2), Davids(1), Van Der Sar(1)  
00-01: Zidane(2), Inzaghi(1)  


Real Madrid  
01-02: Zidane(5), Carlos(4), Raul(2), Morientes(1), Hierro(1), Helguera(1), Casillas(1)  
02-03: Carlos(4), Zidane(3), Ronaldo(2), Raul(2), Helguera(1)  
03-04: Zidane(4), Ronaldo(3), Beckham(2), Carlos(2), Casillas(2), Salgado(1)  
04-05: Ronaldo(1)  
05-06: Robinho(1)  


The above voted on monthly ratings thus seem to paint a different picture regarding Zidane's consistency, to the one painted by the ratings provided by a few individual publications that you have linked to above. IIRC, if you consider Xavi (a midfielder who was considered to be very consistent while also being considered to be quite brilliant) for this same metric, then at the time that he left for Qatar he had a similar number of ESM monthly appearances to Zidane's. Iniesta though has slightly lesser appearances till date, again IIRC.


> Zidane was a great player, for sure, but to put him in top 5s or top 10s in the history of football just reeks of revisionism based on idolized yet sparse highlights. Implying a player as inconsistent, ineffective, with relatively low end product and devoid of tactical finesse as Zidane is anywhere close to being a Top 10 player of all time is a crime to the history of football. In reality, he's barely top 50, if that. Platini was legitimately better, he just didn't deliver a WC - just ask older France or Juventus fans.


Where one puts Zidane is as per their own preference IMO. One can always hold certain qualities above others when forming a list, and the list thus created would reflect that preference.

Zidane being barely top 50 is lol-worthy though, and simply shows how the opinion behind the entire post is probably not something to be taken seriously. After all, it takes a special kind of preference to alternative facts, to suggest that a player who was man of the match in both World Cup and Champions League finals, has won best player of the season awards in three separate leagues, player of the tournament awards for 2 separate international NT tournaments and 1 international club tournament, won the overall player of the year awards on 4 separate years from 3 separate publications, made all time Euro and World Cup teams, won player of the decade from two separate publications and made the all time best XIs for two other publications, is barely top-50. I would dearly like to see a list of 50 players who are more widely decorated, individually. I understand individual awards are out of fashion since Messi and CRonaldo started winning all of them, but the sheer breadth of awards that Zidane has won (even if he might not have the volume), shows peers and observers acknowledging him across a very wide range of tournaments, seasons. and eras. Quite the feat for a barely top-50 player.


> tl;dr Zidane is overrated by millennials who only watched youtube highlights, love how ""classy"" he looked and remember the header on Materazzi. People who actively followed football before and during the 90s know better.

Sexy Space Babes: Chapter Eighty One,"As an expansionist Empire, it really didn’t surprise Jason that the most prestigious Imperial Officer Training Academy on Shil had not one, but multiple auditoriums across its campus.

Or that it had campuses. Plural.

*Because of course* ***the*** *premiere training facility of a galactic superpower has more in common with a small city than anything else,* he thought as he stood impatiently backstage.

It had certainly made for a hell of a sight on the shuttle ride over. The ‘Blackstone’ was a sprawling military complex that housed tens of thousands of instructors, officer trainees, guards and support staff. And unlike most other Marine focused complexes he’d come across that were more utilitarian in nature, the Blackstone had more in common with the Aviary. Which was to say it was *lavish.*

He couldn’t even begin to imagine how much a place like this cost to run.

Yet it was clear the Imperial government was all too happy to foot the bill, since the Blackstone had existed since the days of the first unification war – and had only grown in the intervening centuries, until it had reached the gargantuan size it was today. All in service to churning out more and more young officers to meet the ever-growing needs of the Imperium and her armies.

Certainly, it wasn’t the *only* institution within the Imperium built to meet those needs, but it was certainly the largest.

*And the most prestigious,* he thought as he glanced out from behind the backstage curtains to the massive audience of Humans, Shil and other assorted races that lay beyond.

“You ok, Jason?” Nora asked, standing behind him in her dress-bronze.

He just nodded, mentally keeping track of the droning voice of the General on-stage as he waited for his cue to walk out. As he did, his eyes continued to roam over the Humans who sat in pride of place amongst the frontmost rows.

Nearly a hundred members of the Terran First were present as future students of the academy. An insane number given that the regiment itself only had four thousand members to begin with. Four thousand green members at that – because he knew for a fact that none of the ex-tankers were present.

What had become of them, he had no idea. Apparently during the fighting, they’d just vanished – sans tanks. Nearly two months after his flight from the planet and that mystery seemed no closer to being solved. Some had suggested they’d fled during the fighting, while others proposed that the Alliance had brought to bear some kind of brand new weapon system that erased fabric and flesh.

Jason didn’t know.  He just hoped that wherever they were they were ok.

*Dear god,* he thought, *do I actually… care about those assholes?*

Huh, he supposed he did.

Whatever, they’d find out what happened to them eventually. The Imperium had the planet on lockdown, so the Alliance troops that remained were going nowhere. Which meant the military had all the time in the world to call in a few battalions of Deathshead Commandos to root them out.

A few members of which he’d had the *privilege* of meeting before the Terran First had been flown out – and he did not envy those shark girls one bit. In contrast to just about every other Shil’vati he’d met, the Commando Captain he’d spoken to had seemed positively *giddy* at the prospect of hunting her professional equivalents through a planet-sized cave complex filled with equally deadly fauna. He resisted the urge to shudder as he remembered the grin that had stolen over the woman’s face when he’d mentioned that the group that ambushed him had been sporting active camouflage and how they’d managed to escape by turning the gator-sharks on them.

He momentarily wondered if Freyxh would be amongst their number? The surly recruit would have had ample time to complete her vocational training in the time since he’d last seen her.

*She’d be even more of a badass by now.*

He couldn’t deny that the thought made him a little bitter. Not that Freyxh would be a badass – he’d stridently deny it if anyone asked if he had a “bad girl” fetish – but that she’d be fully trained while he was still… Well, he didn’t know what he was. And neither did the clerical officer who’d looked over his file.

Though it did make him feel a little better that she’d seemed as disgusted as he was at the situation he was in. Not just because it was unfair to him, but because it was dangerous to just about anyone who might serve ‘under’ him. He didn’t know whether it was the note she’d put in his file – in *bright* red ink – that had landed him here, but he was thankful for it.

It had certainly helped that she’d been muttering rather unkind things about ‘nobles and their games’ as she’d done it.

Of course, none of that professionalism had been on display when his new standing orders had finally filtered down. No, he’d gotten the feeling that from the perspective of the Shil’vati Captain that had shown up at his apartment, he was just supposed to be happy that the ‘oversight’ was finally being corrected.

Admittedly, from her perspective, it was being corrected in a *big* way. An invitation to Blackstone was not a small thing. Big as the place was, prospective officers were sent here from all across the Imperium, and competition for a spot was tough.

Which was why he couldn’t see the presence of so many faces from the Terran First without some suspicion.

Him? Sure. He was self aware enough that he was kind of a big deal in certain circles. As the ‘Hero of Gurathu,’ he’d been a recruiting officer’s wet dream. Human. Male. Reasonably attractive. The military had chosen to capitalize on his story because of what he was as much as for what he’d done.

So yeah, he was a known quantity. Having him attend Blackstone as a ‘reward’ for his most recent ‘heroics’ made sense.

…He was also conceited enough to think he *might* have been smart enough to make it on his own merit.

Near a hundred other Humans, though? One in ten of a given sample of Humans?

*Hell, more like one in six given how many people didn’t survive Raknos,* he thought.

No, that spoke of politics on a wider scale than just the Imperial brass performing the PR equivalent of kissing babies or handing out participation trophies.

If they were willing to throw Humanity that big a bone – and no doubt piss off a lot of blue-bloods who’d see it as cheapening Blackstone’s reputation – it suggested to him that a lot of people back on Earth might have been unhappy with so many kids coming back home in coffins.

*Even if those deaths equated to what? About sixteen, maybe seventeen, days of fighting during the Vietnam war?* he thought cynically.

He’d done some research. And while it felt in more than a little poor taste to reduce the lives of the people he’d been fighting with to mere statistics, he  was  the sort to take refuge in math and statistics over emotion.

…To the detriment of a number of his relationships over the years. Both romantic, familial, and platonic.

That was when he heard his cue.

“…against all possible odds, the Hero of Gurathu.”

He stepped out onto the stage as the Marshal looked over at him, the footsteps of his polished boots echoing through the almost entirely silent auditorium. He imagined that in different circumstances there might have been applause to accompany his arrival. This was a military function though, and like most ceremonial events of a military nature, ran much closer to sombre than celebratory. Still, he’d done this rodeo dozens of times before when he’d *first* been dubbed the Hero of Gurathu. So rather than focus on being blinded by the spotlights overhead, he instead focused on counting his steps as he swiftly – but not too swiftly! – made his way over to the General.

Coming slowly to a stop before her, he saluted, placing his hand over his breast in the Imperial fashion. A salute that was returned by the woman and the officers behind her. A salute that had far too much enthusiasm, given the way he heard the audible thumps of firsts hitting breastplates. Ignorant of his discomfort, the scarred woman grinned widely at him before gesturing to the podium.

Nodding his thanks, he stepped up to the smooth wooden construct, running his hands along the varnished exterior as he clicked on the microphone. He didn’t speak though. He waited. For just a moment. Long enough for his gaze to roam over the crowd in a casual and unhurried manner.

*Just like we practiced,* he thought as his recent readings on public speaking for dummies came back to him – borne of some perhaps misplaced guilt at his most recent complete failure as the Terran First’s morale officer.

Sure, while he didn’t quite blame himself for the dissolution of the regiment’s discipline on its final day, he wasn’t so callous as to deny that the maintenance of morale *had* been amongst his primary duties. Duties he’d immediately abandoned in favour of doing what he could actually do, instead of pursuing a line of work for which he was clearly unsuited… but the point remained.

He’d failed.

*Because Terran First was definitely a lot more Lord of the Flies than Charge of the Light Brigade towards the end,* he thought with a hint of melancholy, before straightening up. *Alright, don’t appear unsure, don’t appear unhurried and don’t look like you’re reading from a script.*

Which meant he was supposed to take a moment to ‘think’ as he stared out into the crowd.

His eyes immediately alighted onto the eager and familiar faces of the Terran First – or *former* Terran First, he supposed. Because neither he nor any other Human present were still members of the now storied regiment.

Which had become a not uncommon fate for the survivors of Raknos-Three.

The Terran First still existed in name, of course, but few of the original complement remained. Over the last two months, they’d been reassigned. En masse. Replaced by fresh faced boot Marines straight out of training. Sure, some of the original members were still around, but they were spread  throughout the regiment, clearly just there to mentor the newbies and provide a solid core of veterancy.

Truth be told, he hadn’t been all that bothered by that fact. While many Marines had latched onto the sense of belonging that came with being part of a regiment, to him it had just been another posting.

Still, he’d been at least passively curious as to why so many of his former companions were being shipped out to places unknown. It hadn’t been hard to find out the reason by leaning on his reputation as the Hero of Gurathu.

Someone had taken an interest in the events of Raknos-Three.

Which wasn’t too surprising. Lots of people were interested in what had occurred there. Two – nearly three – Imperial regiments nearly wiped out by an Alliance Black Ops operation? While no one quite knew *why* the coalition of star-nations had done what they’d done, it was still a level of provocation that the Imperials couldn’t ignore - and the Alliance couldn’t deny.

Despite the latter’s best attempts to do so.

But no, the likelihood of a coming war between the Alliance and the Imperium hadn’t been news to him – even if it did sometimes keep him up at night.

No, what had been news to him was that one of the parties interested in the events of Raknos-Three was less concerned with how it had *come about*, as much as how Human Marines had *performed* during.

Said party being a part of the Imperial Family.

*The* Imperial Family. The only one that really mattered.

From what he’d heard, a certain Imperial Princess Kamilesh had become enamoured with tales of Human ingenuity under adversity and started issuing orders as part of her role as head of Imperial Special Operations.

His former comrades weren’t being shuffled into new Shil line regiments. No, they were being shipped off to form the veteran core of a myriad of newly formed ‘Human regiments’.  Regiments that would be based around the idea of hard-hitting strike forces that could continue to fight and complete objectives without orbital support – or in spite of it on the enemy’s part.

An idea that, frankly, he wanted no part of.

Unfortunately for him, Kamilesh had enough political 'umph' to get her new project started.

Which was why he was rapidly getting a feeling that this invitation to Blackwell was not the gift it had been pitched to him as. If anything, it was looking more and more like a collar that was just waiting to be wrapped around his neck.

After all, a longer training period meant a longer service period to recoup the state’s investment.

*…And with war on the horizon and these new Human shock regiments in the pipeline.* Well, he could only hope that a few of his fellow Terran veterans were also smart enough to smell the ash in the wind. *Because I’m sure as hell not about to tell them.*

He was about to be in enough shit without deliberately tweaking some Imperial Princess’s nose by torpedoing the prospective officer core of her new pet project.

The sound of a small cough off to his side, barely perceptible from anything more than a few feet away, shook him from his thoughts. He resisted the urge to smile self-depreciatingly as the General’s small cue reminded him of the fact that his ‘moment of thought’ would soon turn into an awkwardly long silence.

Fortunately, it hadn’t quite passed that invisible signpost just yet, so he cleared his throat with a silent cough before straightening up.

*Pathos, ethos, logos,* he reminded himself.

“My fellow Marines,” he began, because ethos was all about reminding those you were speaking to that you were credible and trustworthy. “Sailors. Soldiers. I come before you today to speak on how honored I am to have received an invitation to this hallowed academy.”

He’d say the lies felt like acid on his tongue, but after nearly two years of spewing whatever bullshit he had to in order to get by, his tongue was pretty damn well numb to it by now.

“And know that while I stand alone up here, I would like to think that I am channelling the thoughts and feelings of my fellow Humans down there in the audience with you. Fellow veterans with whom I have fought, bled and triumphed on the field of battle.”

*More importantly, I’m reminding all you scrubs that unlike most of you, we actually fought to get where we are today,* he thought.

Sure, most of the fighting *he’d* done was entirely unwilling and born of attempts to avoid it, but it had happened. And that was important, because while blood might have talked while merit walked in the Imperium, one didn’t form an Empire borne on the back of conquest without instilling a healthy respect for your military into the minds of your people.

And being a veteran meant you were afforded a certain level of respect beyond that - regardless of your origins. By contrast, most of the Shil present would have entered the officer track straight out of enlistment rather than coming up through the ranks. A fact that was made immediately obvious even by the most casual of glances in his audience’s direction.

Most of them were young.

…Though it wasn’t like his fellow Humans were any older themselves.

Hell, calling them veterans after a single half baked disaster of a campaign was stretching it a bit too now that he thought about it…

Whatever. He was the veteran here. They were scrubs who should shut up and listen even if he was Human. And male.

That was the gist of ethos, right?

“A triumph that was not easily won,” he continued, moving onto pathos, which was apparently all about riling up emotion. Fortunately, that was fairly easy given recent events. “Not because of the Roach pirates as we had so readily been led to believe. No, it was the unprovoked aggressions of Alliance forces that pushed myself and my brave colleagues to the very brink of destruction!”

He let the roars of agreement from the crowd roll over him. Roars that none of the staff present made any attempt to quiet. Which wasn’t all that surprising. Anti-Alliance sentiment within the Imperium was growing as fast as a messenger ship could travel, with the Imperial propaganda machine blaring out what had occurred on Raknos-Three to all that would listen.

Sure, the Alliance was denying it just as fervently, but no one within the Imperium’s borders was listening to them.

Likely helped by the fact that the Alliance had never been well-loved by the people of the Imperium. Sure, they were held with less contempt than the Consortium, but that wasn’t exactly a high bar to beat. While the people of the Consortium were seen as untrustworthy slavers, those of the Alliance were seen as two-faced bureaucrats - ones with an unearned superiority complex. Pacifists who cried out for peace while arming every thug, pirate or merc in the universe who might have an axe to grind with the Imperium.

Which, given said superpower's usual behaviour, amounted to quite a few axes indeed.

Hence why Jason was entirely certain that he wasn’t mistaken when he detected a certain level of… schadenfreude with them being caught with their hand in the proverbial cookie jar. A cookie jar filled with war crimes.

“Fortunately for us all, it was through grit, daring, and innovation that my peers and I were able to turn the tide. In doing so we turned a cowardly ambush, intended to leave no survivors and our great Imperium blind to the threat of Alliance, into a trap of our own. Even now, those who thought to destroy us lay alone and isolated on the planet with which they thought to make our tomb. As I speak, battalions of the Imperium’s finest descend upon them, bringing forth fire and ruin as they burn the invaders from our lands.” He paused. “Make no mistake. None shall escape. And before the battle is through, all their secrets shall be wrung from their deceitful throats – and we shall have the name of our true enemies.”

He resisted the urge to frown as he reached the end of the paragraph and the crowd started chanting. “Cave Man! Cave Man! Cave Man!”

How he hated the latest nickname he’d been saddled with. He knew the Shil didn’t mean anything by it. To them it was little different from calling someone something like ‘Wonder Woman’ or ‘Bat Man’.

And his fellow Humans in the Terran First found it hilarious. The *traitors.*

He also hated the way the staff nearest him were giving him acknowledging nods rather than forcing the crowds back into obedient silence.

…Hell, while he was on the subject, he hated the speech he’d just made too. It was all a little too fire and brimstone for his taste. Because, while he’d written the *broad* strokes, it was the Imperial Propaganda office that had then *punched it up*.

And they apparently loved the kind of campy, patriotic jingoism that made him want to roll his eyes.

Unfortunately, there was a grand total of nothing he could do about any of it beyond standing in ‘flattered silence and waiting for the chanting to stop'.

Which took a while.

Eventually though, it did end. “Still, for all that the Terran First – and Humanity – proved more than capable of rising to meet our Imperium’s newest challenges, talent without temperance is mere hubris. Brittle. Easily blunted.”

He could think of a few Shil that the last line could apply to – sans the talent – still, happy with the hushed response he was getting, he decided it was time to move on.

*Logos,* he thought. *Making your audience see the logic in what you’re saying.*

A curt gesture to the Master Sergeant had her bringing forth a box that was held with far too much reverence for what he knew contained little more than a slip of paper.

“Fortunately for myself and my fellow Marines,” he said as he reached inside to withdraw… a gold embroidered letter from the box rather than the comparatively plain invitation from the Marshal’s office it was supposed to contain.

It actually took him a few moments for his brain to catch up to exactly what he was holding, his rehearsed response totally derailed by the unexpected swap.

He barely registered it as just about every Shil in attendance leapt to their feet to stand at attention – a feat followed barely a second later by the Humans in the crowd. Most of his attention was on the surprisingly subdued purple wax seal stuck to the bottom of the sheet he was holding.

Not that the seal was really needed to see it to know from whom this letter had originated.

Even an outsider like him knew that only one family within the Imperium was allowed to use this particular pattern of gold embroidery in their official correspondences.

The Imperial *Family.*

*The Imperial Family.*

*Well, shit, someone’s pulled a fast one on me,* he thought as he a small bead of sweat formed at the back of his neck as he realized what he was holding

Suddenly the look of subdued awe that Sergeant-At-Arms had been wearing all evening made a lot more sense.

“As part of my role as head of Imperial Special Operations,” he began to read, “it is the decision of Her Majesty Princess Kamilesh, that no less than one hundred women and men from the recently triumphant Terran First Regiment are to be given the opportunity to partake of higher learning at the venerable Blackstone institute. These one hundred officer candidates are to be decided by willingness to partake, aptitude for leadership training, peer review, a panel of officers, and the High Marshal of the Blackstone herself.”

He didn’t miss the way the Humans in the audience seemed to grow in height as he spoke, their Shil’vati peers looking on in envy. Sure, the average Human didn’t venerate the Empress quite like the Shil did, but they weren’t ignorant to how important they were either. As evidenced by the wave of hushed awe that ran through the room as he continued.

“As a Princess, a sailor and a Commander, I have over the course of my life been privileged to witness many examples of heroism in the face of adversity. It was said by Helfess the First, that the Imperium was built upon both the corpses of her patriots and foes. A saying I find no less true today than it was back during the first Unification War.” He paused. “Colonel Cleff embodied those words to her dying breath. Using the time bought for her by the noble sacrifice of her two sister regiments, Colonel Cleff chose not to flee before what no doubt seemed like an impossible battle. Instead, she held true to the Imperial spirit. Defiance in the face of a cold unfeeling universe.”

Jason resisted the urge to roll his eyes as he continued. He respected Cleff. He really did. But he would never agree with her final decision to go down swinging rather than seek out possible alternatives to a frankly hopeless situation.

“Yet it is not the dearly departed Colonel’s valiant adherence to the Imperial spirit that I am here to congratulate today. After all, such an act is only to be expected of an officer of the Imperium. It’s sublime beauty akin to that of a sunset or a rainbow. Deserving of admiration, yet ultimately commonplace. The Imperium is a nation of heroes. Heroes that die every day to maintain her.”

Now he resisted the urge to gnash his teeth at the dismissal of the letter’s tone.

…Even if he agreed with the sentiment being put forth. Cleff’s death was nothing special. Just like so many others that had died on Raknos-Three, she was just another body on the massive pyre that was the Imperium. More fuel for a massive entity that by sheer virtue of its size, was incapable of reciprocating that devotion – *if* it were so inclined.

“Which is why it was not Colonel Cleff’s first or last actions in the face of disaster that drew my attention to her. No, it was her decisions in between. Decisions made at the behest of a man well known to you all. Jason Linford, the Hero of Gurathu and Champion of the Terran First.”

Jason felt a wave of self-loathing run through him as cheers rang out from the crowd. Originally, he’d wanted his ‘plan’ to message the fleet in orbit to have been entirely Cleff’s idea. Friska had vetoed that out of hand. Too uncharacteristic, she’d stated. Cleff was cunning enough when it came to combat, as evidenced by her underwater assault plan, but anyone who’d ever spent five minutes with her would know she was no diplomat. And his plan to signal the ships in orbit had relied upon Maybel coming forward and informing him of the shuttle’s presence. More to the point, it was well known by the regiment that he’d been the one negotiating with them. So no, he couldn’t heap all of the praise and adoration onto Cleff while he slunk back into the shadows, merely a pawn in his commanding officer’s game.

Instead, he was the grand architect of the hairbrained scheme. Being praised for actions that had been far more a result of enlightened self interest than genuine patriotism or heroic inclinations.

“He was the one who negotiated with the natives of Raknos-Three, winning enough of their trust that they chose to reveal unto him that they had safeguarded an Imperial shuttle from the Roach invaders when the world first fell into their slimy clutches.”

Another lie, one required to make the Ufrians look good and buy Maybel’s cooperation. He didn’t know what exactly they’d be receiving in return for their aid, but according to the few officers he’d spoken to on the matter, it likely wouldn’t be small.

“He was the one who put forth the plan to signal the fleet in orbit using that ship. Both warning the Imperium of the Alliance’s subterfuge and saving his allies on the surface by conveying precise targeting coordinates to the fleet’s guns. All of this completed mere hours after escaping an ambush beneath the planet’s surface, one in which he was wounded gravely.”

He frowned. Wasn’t that a bit of an overstatement? He’d been shot in the arm.

*Then again, they were rather large harpoons,* he thought.

He shook his head. That didn’t matter. None of this did. It was just theatre. Perhaps if he thought any of this praise were genuine, he might have been blushing at it all. As it was though, he felt little more than uncomfortable at the uninhibited *gushing* he was receiving from the pen of a member of the Imperial family.

“Such tenacity in the face of otherwise impossible odds. Those were my thoughts as I read through the after-action reports. I must admit, my curiosity was piqued. Which in turn, led me to reading through yet another note in the Champion’s file. Of the events of Gurathu and his heroics there. Which read much the same. In a situation where any other Imperial would choose to go down swinging with pride, this Human had sought out an unlikely means to attain victory. And again, as I read deeper, I found that even as a trainee on his final live fire exercise, this Jason Linford had managed to turn what was thought to be an impossible situation around.”

He heard some small muttering in the crowd at that. Hushed whispers that he couldn’t quite make out.

“I had to ask myself: What motivates this Human? To go to such lengths? To see victory in a situation where others see only defeat? Well, after a time searching I found my answer.

From the great Human general, George Patton.

*‘The object of war is not to die for your country, but to make the other bastard die for his.’*

I must admit I chuckled at those words. While lacking the… eloquence of our own great first Empress, I couldn’t help but find a crude beauty in them. In the purity of purpose.”

This time it really was a fight for him to not roll his eyes at the alien princess’ condescension even as she *tried* to be complimentary. Which was a perfect encapsulation of Imperial-Earth relations as a whole really.

“A purity of purpose that will be needed in the days to come. I need it. The Imperium needs it. Now more than ever.” He fought a frown. “A storm is coming, ladies and gentlemen. Enemies that have long since lurked in the shadows have finally overplayed their hand - and now a reckoning descends upon them. Not yet. But soon. So take this time. Enjoy your reward and the prestige that accompanies it. You have earned it. But do not dally or rest easy on your laurels. Learn all you can. Sharpen your claws. Hone your wits. They will be needed in the days to come.”

Jason couldn’t help the small shiver that ran up his spine at those words. Where before he’d felt some small vindication in the knowledge that the Alliance would suffer for all those people it had killed, now he could only think of what that would mean.

*All-out war between two galactic superpowers,* he thought. *A war large enough to make any conflict on Earth look like a schoolyard squabble by comparison.*

He couldn’t even begin to imagine the scale of death and destruction that was to come. As he glanced- at the crowd before him, he couldn’t help but wonder how many of those youthful faces would live to see the end of it?

*Half? None?* he wondered. *Would a war on this scale even end with this generation?*

He didn’t know. What he did know was that he wanted no part of it. Almost without thought, his fingers brushed against the omni-pad at his waist. Comforted by its familiar presence, he turned his gaze back to the sheet before him.

“To that end, I intend to offer the Champion Jason Linford a spot on my general staff. Effective immediately.” His stomach dropped, even as he heard excited whispers break out amongst the crowd.

An opportunity to work with a member of the Imperial family? As part of her entourage? That was not an offer made lightly. And while it came with great expectations, it also carried great rewards and opportunities.

For what else could the chance to have the ear of the woman who might become the next Empress but an opportunity?

A fact that was not lost on anyone present.

With a mouth that suddenly felt incredibly dry, Jason continued speaking. “While it pains me to deprive a promising young man of an opportunity to further his learning amongst the great halls of the Blackstone – of which I have many fond memories – it is a sad reality that his intelligence, drive and unpredictable nature will be of more use elsewhere. Such is the unfortunate fate of all who choose to exceed.”

*I didn’t choose dick,* he thought cynically. *If anything, I chose the opposite and failed miserably at trying to attain it.*

“To that end-” He glanced at his watch, heart jumping in his chest as he saw the number.

It was time. Now or never.

He closed his eyes, ignoring the noises of confusion that sounded out around him at his abrupt pause.

His throat felt dryer than the sands of the sahara, his palms were sweating, and blood was rushing in his ears.

“I’d just like to say, fuck that noise.” He opened his eyes, manic grin widening as he gazed out over the shocked faces arrayed before him.

*You’ve done it now,* he thought. *You big moron.*

Yet his heart felt lighter than a feather as yet more words spilled forth from his mouth.

“That was me talking, by the way. Be a bit odd if the Princess had put that in her letter.” With deliberate disdain, he slid the golden letter off the podium, revelling in the scandalized gasps as the expensive bit of stationary hit the floor. “Which is why, for the sake of clarity, I’ll repeat myself. Fuck. That. Noise.”

Part of him had been expecting yelling at this point in proceedings, but all he was greeted with was stony silence. Which was a pleasant surprise really. It would have been annoying to have to shout over people.

After all, he had a lot he wanted to say.

""I'm not a rabble rouser. I'm not a political animal,” He started, “I'm not an activist. I was just a guy who was willing to roll with the punches, keep my head down, and get on with the job.""

He stared down at them. ""But you made that impossible.""

“I’ve been badgered, belittled, discriminated against, underestimated, overestimated, assaulted, lied to, cheated and just generally been screwed at every possible opportunity. Sometimes metaphorically. Often literally.”

The crowd was deadly silent.

“But you know what? I could forgive that. Really. All of it. I mean, it’s the military after all. Having the government fuck you is pretty much a universal expectation in any branch of service.”

As he spoke, he carefully pulled off his medals, placing each down upon the podium with an audible clunk.

“No, I could forgive it all if you all weren’t so damn incompetent. Propelled forward through the cosmos through sheer fucking inertia. Because at every possible opportunity, I’ve had the cracks in the ‘vaunted Imperium’ shoved in my face. Do well in a training exercise? Get sent off to a frozen iceball in the ass end of nowhere by a spoiled rich girl. Try and keep a low profile on said frozen iceball? Nearly get kidnapped by another spoiled rich girl who also happens to be a slaver on the side. Somehow manage to survive that? Get sent to another planet with shitty equipment, next to no training, and a rather horrific lack of recon.”

He slumped, finally letting the weight of everything that had happened wash over him.

“So no. I’m done. I’m backing out now, before I get dropped into a newer, bigger, dumpster-fire.”

He looked up, letting his gaze roam over the faces of his fellow humans.

“So, my fellow officer candidates, you want my advice? You want to know how I got all these medals? How I managed to do all the things I did? The answer is simple.” He leaned towards the microphone. “Always assume that the system is out to fuck you in some way. Do that, and you might avoid slipping through the gaping cracks in the vaunted Imperium’s facade of freedom and civility.”

He grinned, leaning back.

“Which is why I’m leaving.” He smiled. “Or if I’m being technical, I’ve already left.”

As he spoke, he brought up his Omni-pad, turning it on and deftly flipping to the data-mail confirmation he knew would be waiting for him. Or at least, he had really hoped was waiting for him, because things were about to get very awkward if it wasn’t.

Fortunately, it was.

In big blue letters, alongside a dozen other emails, in fairly innocuous words:

*Monetary Discharge Order – Champion Jason Linford – 104/526/327.*

Grinning, he flipped it around. “As of three minutes ago, my application for a monetary discharge order was approved. For those unfamiliar with such an order, that means I bought my way out of the military for a small fortune.”

Specifically, most of his savings and the entirety of the profits he’d received for his ‘invention of the mouse’ way back on Gurathu. He was cleaned out. Essentially penniless. And soon to be about as employable as a Roach in the business sector.

And he couldn’t be happier. Even as the ambient noise in the room started to rise as people finally got over their initial shock… and started to transition to outrage.

Which wasn’t too much of a problem for him. He just needed to shout out over them. “For those who are curious, a monetary discharge order can’t be blocked. Requires no approval from anyone beyond the monetary discharge order committee - a committee whose only concern is whether or not an individual has the credits to apply. And is effective immediately upon the appropriate paperwork being filed.”

Which was frankly absurd. He’d actually had to read the fine print on the application twice to be sure that he was reading what he thought he was reading.

It was true though. A monetary discharge order was essentially a ‘get out of jail free card’ for the Imperium’s rich, powerful and spoiled. Sure, it hadn’t started out that way, but that was what a few thousand years of amendments had turned it into.

Originally it had just been meant as a way for landed knights to waive their personal service by paying their liege a sum ample enough to cover the cost of a force of mercenaries to fight in their stead. Over the subsequent millennia though, it had transitioned into a way for nobles to skip out of the military if things were getting a little too difficult for them. The funds involved now simply a means to remunerate the state for the inconvenience, and a way for it to recoup whatever investment had already been made into that particular noble’s training and equipment.

A few times over.

Quick, simple and utterly inaccessible to anyone who wasn’t rich as sin. Because while a monetary discharge was open to everyone, the cost involved was astronomical. To the point where only the wealthy elite might be able to afford it.

*Or, a dude who found himself receiving a rather nice windfall from an unexpected patenting of his idea,* he thought.

Did he feel dirty for using such a ridiculous law to get out of this?

*Not even a little,* he thought. *Fuck ‘em.*

He owed the Imperium nothing. Not his time. Not his life. And certainly not his peace of mind. He’d not lose any sleep over using one of their own loopholes to escape. He’d let others worry about right and wrong.

As always, he’d keep doing whatever he needed to in order to get by.

He might have been tempted to say a few more words, but the noise level in the room had now risen to a point where he doubted he’d have been able to shout over it. People were shouting at him. Shil’vati were arguing with Humans. Humans were arguing with Shil’vati. Shil’vati were arguing with Shil’vati. Humans were arguing with Humans. Staff were arguing with each other.

No, he didn’t think he’d be getting a chance to get anything else to say.

And given that he was now a civilian, he figured the only lawful thing to do would be to vacate the premises. The Blackstone was a military academy after all. And he was a civilian. He had a note to say so and everything.

“Hyuk!” That mantra was still repeating in his head when he got tackled by an MP, barely five feet from the podium.

Things… only got more complicated from there.

The Monstars were easily the worst team Charles Barkley has ever played on.,"&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Charles Barkley is a well traveled man. He's played on NBA teams from every corner of the country, on a national team overseas, and on a fictional cartoon team located under a golf course. It's easy to get overwhelmed by all of these leagues and rosters to figure out which team was best. Logically, one could make the assumption that the best team was the one handpicked by aliens comprised of the most talented players they could find with no pesky restrictions like a salary cap or country of origin constraints. That person would be very wrong. Let's take a look at each of his teams starting with the Monstars.

####Monstars

Barkley's Teammates|Most Notable Accomplishments
:--|--:
Patrick Ewing| 11x All-Star, 1x All-NBA First Team, Rookie of the Year
Larry Johnson| 2x All-Star, Rookie of the Year
Shawn Bradley| NBA All-Rookie Second Team
Muggsy Bogues| 5 ft 3 in

Really? This is the team that scared the Looney Tunes into recruiting the best basketball player of all time? If you're counting at home, his teammates have a total of zero NBA championships, zero MVPs, and aside from Ewing, 2 All-Star appearances. Now let's move on to his NBA teams.

***

####76ers

I'll only pick four teammates from one year for each NBA team to be fair. I'm going with '85-'86 Sixers, the best Barkley Philly team on paper in my opinion.

Barkley's Teammates|Most Notable Accomplishments
:--|--:
Moses Malone| 3x NBA MVP, 1x Finals MVP, 1x NBA Champion, 4x All-NBA First Team, 13x All-Star
Julius ""Dr. J"" Erving | 1x NBA MVP, 3x ABA MVP, 1x NBA Champion, 2x ABA Champion, 5x All-NBA First Team, 16x All-Star
Bob McAdoo| 1x NBA MVP, 2x NBA Champion, 5x All-Star, 1x All-NBA First Team, Rookie of the Year
Mo Cheeks| 1 NBA Championship, 4x All-Star

Not even close. You could take Barkley and Malone and fill the rest of the roster with Tiny Toons and I'd still take this team. Not including Barkley, you've got 8 MVP trophies, 6 Championships, 3 Hall of Famers and too many accolades to count. Next.

***

####Suns

For the Suns, I'll use the '92-'93 roster. They went 62-20, Barkley won MVP,  and they made it to the Finals.

Barkley's Teammates|Most Notable Accomplishments
:--|--:
Kevin Johnson| 3x All-Star, Most Improved Player, 4x All-NBA Second Team (First team was MJ and Magic)
Tom Chambers| 4x All-Star, All-Star Game MVP, 2x All-NBA Second Team
Dan Majerle| 3x All-Star, 2x NBA All-Defense
Danny Ainge| 1x All-Star, 2x NBA Champion, 1x 3-FGM Leader

This one gets a little more interesting because Barkley doesn't have a teammate as nearly as good as Ewing on these Suns. But look a little deeper and you can see its not really close at all. You've four All-Stars, two fringe Hall of Famers in KJ and Chambers both in their prime and a veteran with two rings in Ainge.  Not to mention the fact that they beat MJ 3 times that year who had the help of actual NBA players on his team. Next.

***

####Rockets

I'll take the '96-'97 Rockets, otherwise known as Barkley's last hurrah 

Barkley's Teammates|Most Notable Accomplishments
:--|--:
Hakeem Olajuwon| 1x MVP, 2x Finals MVP, 2x Defensive Player of the Year, 2x NBA Champion, 12x All-Star, 6x All-NBA First Team, 5x NBA All-Defense First Team
Clyde Drexler| 10x All-Star, 1x NBA Champion, 1x All-NBA First Team
Kevin Willis| 1x All-Star, 1x NBA Champion, 1x All-NBA Third Team
Matt Maloney| Is a point guard

Does it matter who Matt Maloney is? Absolutely not. The fact that Charles Barkley is arguably the third best player on this team tells you enough. Dream, Glide and Chuck all on one team? Goodnight. 

I won't even throw up a Dream Team roster to compare to the Monstars, that would be cruel. When it comes to acting, they may have been the better squad, but as for basketball, they should just [be gone](http://gfycat.com/FilthyOrderlyBonobo).",https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/3dyejg/the_monstars_were_easily_the_worst_team_charles/,SpaghettoSwagu,2015-07-20 20:30:03,2522,nba

**Balance Changes**

Dart Monkey

Juggernaut relying on ricochets felt too niche in the current game, sadly excelling in far too few situations, so instead the Ceramic damage strength has been increased leading a little better into the T5 and benefiting it in more general straight line situations. Crossbow Master is pretty much around the entry level T5 that we want, but a little too expensive for something that brings no extra utility.

* 4xx Juggernaut ceramic bonus increased from +2 -> 3
* xx5 Crossbow Master price $25,000 -> 23,500

Boomerang Monkey

To buff Glaive Lords middle crosspath as a choice & utilize more of an attack that is mostly rendered useless by this tier, the base damage of the thrown ricochet attack has been increased. Bionic Boomerang’s price has been lowered to make this upgrade slightly more approachable, but Turbo Charge’s price increased as we’re ok with the higher tiers on this path. Finally MOAB Dom’s price has been reduced a little, while this upgrade mostly fits as an early freeplay support/carry this price buff will make it more affordable before then and slightly benefit saveup for the paragon.

* 5xx Glaive Lord main attack damage increased from 1 -> 8
* x3x Bionic Boomerang price 1600 -> 1450
* x4x Turbo Charge price $4000 -> $4200
* 005 Moab Domination price reduced $60k -> 50k

Bomb Shooter

Has strong meta usage, Mauler as a moab focus upgrade no longer needs the bonus to ceramic crutch

* x3x MOAB Mauler ceram bonus reduced 1 -> 0

Tack Shooter

Ring of Fire doesn’t keep up well enough for where it is placed, so the attack speed increase from this upgrade has been bumped up from 15% to 25%. Inferno Ring itself feels ok but for the difficult saveup not so much, so as a bit of a buff we have added crosspathing to the Meteor attack.

* 4xx Ring of Fire attack delay reduced from 0.5355 -> 0.4725
* 5xx Inferno Ring still sets attack delay to a flat 0.1
* 520 Inferno Ring, Super Range grants meteor base pierce 1 -> 2
* 502 Inferno Ring, Even More Tacks grants meteor dmg 700 -> 1000

Ice Monkey

Cryo Cannon has pulled far ahead of similar cheap Bloon control options, while leading into the also quite cheap Icicles which for most of the game offers more Bloon shredding support for cheaper than those other options.

* xx4 Icicles price increased from $2000 -> 2750

Sniper Monkey

Elite Sniper bouncing bullet jump distance has been reduced so that it can't quite bridge small track splits so easily, however to change up use this lost distance has been added back to crosspathing. Elite Defender falls off a lot after midgame & really lacks any true cross pathing choice, so it has had some MOAB damage added to the base attack with the amount improved from crosspathing.

* x3x Bouncing Bullet - bounce distance reduced slightly 50 -> 40
* 230 Bouncing Bullet distance increased back distance: 40 -> 50
* 004 Full Auto Rifle gains MOAB bonus to initial hit 0 -> +1
* 005 Elite Defender gains MOAB bonus to initial hit 0 -> +2
* 105 Elite Defender gains MOAB bonus to initial hit 0 -> +3
* 205 Elite Defender gains MOAB bonus to initial hit 0 -> +4


Monkey Sub

Previously the rate increase to Ballistic Missile from crosspath was reduced due to Airburst having enough value on it’s own. This reason still applies as Airburst provides a significant power boost just on it’s own, so all rate increase has been removed from Airburst and applied directly to the base Ballistic Missile to help crosspath diversity slightly.

* 030 Ballistic Missile attack rate 1.105 -> 0.9945
* 032 Ballistic Missile no longer adds 10% rate

Monkey Buccaneer

Some parts of the new Buccaneer paragon were balanced more around a Degree 100 level without properly scaling, so we have fixed up some of this to better fit scaling up to 100 reaching those values, and moved the ability for it and any possible future paragons to also scale in cooldown based on the Degree.

* All Paragon Ability Cooldowns will now increase rate in a similar formula to attack speed
* Navarch passive grapple hook rate: 0.02 -> 0.06
* Navarch active grapple hook cooldown: 20 -> 30

Monkey Ace

More of a straight quality of life, Ace has gained a new special toggle button to allow it to turn back and fly in reverse on any selected flight pattern. As Ground Zero stands out in power, & enough so to make the upgrade to Tsar Bomba questionable, some upgrade cost has been moved out of Tsar Bomba into Ground Zero to make Ground Zero more expensive while not changing Tsar much other than a slight overall cost buff. While Flying Fortress has started to see use in Boss events this feels like more of a cash dump than actual value in the tower. As Spectre value already drops off the later any game gets, the saveup into a ‘better version’ also drops off in value, and so the price should reflect that better.

* 000 Monkey Ace can now toggle flight direction for any pattern.
* x4x Ground Zero price increased from $14,000 -> 18,000
* x5x Tsar Bomba price decreased from $35,000 -> 30,000
* xx5 Flying Fortress price 100k -> 85k

Heli Pilot

Comanche Defense mostly suffered during downtime and so the base Heli at T4 has had some  general improvements made to power, but the mini helis have also gained a pierce increase to provide the darts with some improved crowd control

* xx4 Comanche Defense main heli Missile rate increased 3s -> 1
* xx4 Comanche Defense main heli dart damage increased 1 -> 2
* xx4 Comanche Defense mini heli pierce increased 3 -> 4
* xx5 Comanche Commander main heli dart damage increased 2 -> 3

Mortar Monkey

Mortar top path feels too weak for the lead up to the Tier 5, so it along with the T5 have had some general number increases. Additionally the 302 crosspath has failed to ever see a great deal of use compared to much faster firing, to make it easier to to use up power from the DoT this path will now burn through faster

* 2xx Bloon Buster price reduced $650 -> 500
* 3xx Shell Shock price reduced $1100 -> 900
* 4xx The Big One damage increased 5 -> 7
* 5xx The Biggest One center AoE damage increased 20 -> 25
* 5xx The Biggest One outer AoE ceram damage 10 -> 20
* 302 Shell Shock allows burn from this tower to tic twice as fast (also expires twice as fast)
* 402 The Big One, Burny Stuff damage over time increased from 3 -> 5

Dartling Gunner

Dartling’s Ray of Doom is far too expensive for general use, so before looking at any further power related buffs we’re lowering the price. Middle Path rocket storm is too strong for something also so buffable so is getting some number changes. Additionally Rocket Storm has always fired through blockers as we didn’t want to cripple placement too much, at this point we feel like it should be strong enough of an upgrade to have to deal with the placement problems that come with blocking objects. Finally as the Laser Shock crosspath is not so favorable for Buckshot path dartlings, we have doubled down on the ‘Focus’ of Focussed Firing to also increase projectile travel distance.

* 5xx Ray of Doom price $95k -> $80k
* x4x Rocket Storm ability damage reduced 6 -> 5
* x4x Rocket Storm ability duration reduced 10s -> 8
* x4x Rocket Storm ability no longer ignores blockers
* 103 Buckshot’s Focus Firing crosspath grants distance to projectiles +25%

Wizard Monkey

As base Wizard shines in no way & doesn’t lead into any immediately good cheap lower tiers aside from Wall of Fire, the base price is being slightly lowered at the cost of an increase to Wall of Fire. The role Arcane Spike filled at game launch has been replaced as better synergies were learned & added over time. As it's slightly too expensive at some early key points the price is being lowered to hopefully fit some use in at those points. Wizard Prince of Darkness is annoying to position correctly due to the sudden massive radius increase & it also needs a power nerf. So overall here we are moving all of the range increase down into a lower amount at the T3 so that range positioning is known before buying any necromancer upgrades, as well as moving some of the lifespan of the zombies themselves into the lesser used 1xx lifespan crosspath.

* 000 Wizard price reduced $400 -> 375
* x2x Wall of Fire price increased from $900 -> 950
* 4xx Arcane Spike price reduced from $10,900 -> 10,000
* xx3 Shimmer tower range increased from 40 -> 60
* xx5 Prince of Darkness tower range reduced 80 -> 60
* xx4 Necromancer base Zombie travel distance reduced 250 -> 175
* 104 Necromancer base Zombie travel distance remains at 250
* xx5 Prince of Darkness base MOAB travel distance reduced 300 -> 225
* 105 Prince of Darkness MOAB travel distance remains at 300
* xx5 Prince of Darkness base BFB travel distance reduced 200 -> 150
* 105 Prince of Darkness BFB travel distance increased from 200 -> 225

Super Monkey

We wanted some more meaning to middle path being a pierce choice aside from just being cheaper, so we’ve lowered Plasma Blast pierce but reduced its price. Sun Avatar and Robo Monkey have had small price decreases while Dark Knight has had a small increase to line the T3s a little closer up. Dark Champion has had a ceramic bonus added to deal with super ceramics as it is priced only for use in that lategame range, and Legend has had a price reduction to compensate for a rework to the passive ability preventing chained use in deep freeplay.

* 2xx Plasma Blasts pierce 3 -> 2
* 2xx Plasma Blasts price 4500 -> 3000
* 3xx Sun Avatar pierce is unchanged from the above reduction
* 3xx Sun Avatar $22,000 -> 20,000
* x3x Robo Monkey $8400 -> 8000
* xx3 Dark Knight $5500 -> 5600
* xx4 Dark Champion gains bonus damage to Ceramic -> +2
* xx5 Legend of the Night price reduced $240,000 -> 200,000
* xx5 LotN passive ability cooldown will carry on if the tower is sold and rebought.

Druid

Druid base price has been reduced slightly to fit it in a little better as a starter choice.

Top path has had a number of buffs to help with both price and consistency in control over regular bloons through higher tiers. Superstorm has had a rather big price buff, however to prevent it locking up games in a boring stall state the blowback distance against ZOMGs has been halved (There may be disagreement here, but we see this Superstorm change as a double positive).

* 000 Druid price reduced from $425 -> 400
* 3xx Druid of the Storm price reduced from $1850 to 1650
* 4xx Ball Lightning's Storm blowback at T4 improved minimum 100 -> 150
* 4xx Ball Lightning's Storm blowback at T4 improved maximum 200 -> 250
* 4xx Ball Lightning's Storm pierce increased at T4 from 30 -> 60
* 4xx Ball Lightning price reduced from $5100 -> 4500
* 4xx Ball Lightning now has Cold Front MK freeze chance by default
* Cold Front MK now increases chance from 25% -> 100
* 5xx Superstorm price reduced $80k -> 65,000
* 5xx Superstorm blows back ZOMGs for half the distance

Monkey Village

To improve the consistency of Primary Expertise as a long range cleanup the attack rate has been increased.

* 5xx Primary Expertise attack delay 3s -> 2.5

Engineer

To add a bit of quality of life solving problems with trap needing to fill once before moving to target location, Bloontraps placed off-track never being able to fill, and maybe even to just add some interesting micro, any Bloontraps will now become expired after a short delay when their Engineer has a new target set.

* 014 Bloontrap: Picking new target expires current Bloontrap & places new one

Quincy

This upgrade didn’t have enough impact so late in the game and upgrade tree.

* Lv17 now increases Quincy Explosive Arrow frequently from every 3 -> 2 shots

Admiral Brickell

To help Brickell excel a little better at her thematic niche of water support, we have added a small permanent buff to all water in her radius to allow her to give them a bit of extra juice even during ability downtime. Additional minor buffs to her main slow-hard hitting revolver attack as she levels up.

* Lv8 Also grants a permanent +1 pierce to all water towers in radius
* Lv15 Revolver attack damage increased from 7 -> 9
* Lv17 Revolver attack damage increased from 7 -> 11",https://www.reddit.com/r/btd6/comments/shlj0p/bloons_td_6_update_preview_upcoming_v300/,rohan_spibo,2022-02-01 09:02:55,2507,btd6
"A former Italian basketball player shared on Facebook his memory of the time he had to guard a very young Kobe. I thought it was beautiful and that maybe you guys might like it. I don't know if it has been translated already, I did my best but sorry anyway for my English.","Hi kid,

I'm the guy in the white jersey in this picture, and it took me two days to process what has happened.

Hi kid, I was saying... To me you will forever be that nice kid at the Piattelli Trophy in Montecatini Terme in 1989: a scrawny kid with the longest legs, with lively eyes and a smile that would have, later, charmed not only basketball but the world as a whole. 

A kid that one night, thirthy years ago, did something unique and unrepeatable: step on the court alongside your father ""Billy Joe"", with the ""grown-ups"" during the Finals of a summer tournament, with his jersey down to his knees and the shamelessness of Champions, even if you were only eleven. You tried to leave a mark on the game, to be a protagonist and not just an extra, like you would have done later and for the rest of your career.

The Finals of a summer tournament, probably one of the most important tournaments at the time, played in Montecatini during the best years of basketball in Tuscany; on the court there were only adult players, from Serie A, Serie B, Serie C and Serie D; from Montecatini, Pistoia, Livorno, Siena and Florence: nobody wanted to lose, it was serious business...

Matters of local rivalries and honor, ""italian suburbs"" stuff, but feelings and emotions that you would have brought, with your immense talent, to basketball overseas. 

""A kid on the court, how cute!"", was the thought of the 1,000 people on the stands, among them your mother, that looks at you, entranced. 


""A kid on the court, what a bore!"", the athletes thought. 

""What am I supposed to do now?"", the thought of the man that had to guard you. 

And that man, for better or for worse, was me, a mediocre player from the lower Tuscan divisions. 

The kid catches the ball... And I tell myself ""don't move, don't do anything... It's a kid!""

The kid shoots from 3... Nothing but net, the crowd goes wild, my teammates show signs of disapproval.

On the next play, the kid gets the ball again... I think ""get closer, but don't raise your arms... It's a kid!""

The kid, careless, shoots again from 3... and he scores again! The crowd shouts again, my mates grumble again, my coach that didn't want to lose (nobody did) calls a timeout and demands me to defend. 


We get back on the court. 


Again the kid has the ball.

The whole arena wants the kid to shoot. And cheers him. 

All my teammates want me to defend. And shout ""don't let him shoot!""

""F- me"" I think ""what should I do now?""

I get closer to the kid and with my eyes I try to tell him ""don't do it, please""

No chance, he's got only sheer determination in his eyes (was the mamba mentality already there?)

The crowd is out of their minds: shoot! Shoot again!

I raise my arms without even looking at the kid.

As reckless as before, he takes the ball, bigger and heavier than him, and shoots it.

Unintentionally and inevitably, I block the shot: what's his mother going to think about me?


The arena screams disappointed at me, my mates keep on playing like nothing ever happened...

I start laughing facing this tragicomical situation and tell the coach ""either you bench me now or you're coming here and guard this kid!""

Right... The kid... That kid, that in a few years would have given to basketball so many emotions that nobody could ever imagine, including the best love letter, the best farewell that anyone has written. 


Goodbye kid...


Now you'll make angels fall in love with basketball: every basket a divine ""plan""!

Maybe one day we'll play again 1 on 1, and, without any doubt, you'll give me back that ridiculous block, while your daughter will watch us and laugh. 


5...4...3...2...1...


Farewell, Kobe. It has been beautiful.

[](#icon-info-big) **MATCH EVENTS:**

**Pre-Match**

-75' - Lineups announced.

-15' - Hello and welcome to the second quarter final of the World Cup as five time world champions and tournament favourites Brazil take on free scoring Belgium. The winner of this match will set up a semi-final tie with France. Brazil have lived up to their tag of tournament favourites and have looked the most convincing team in the tournament even as other favourites fell by the wayside. Belgium on the other hand, despite being the highest scoring team, needed a last minute goal to win their last 16 match against Japan. 

-10' - Both teams are assembled in the tunnel. 

-6' - The teams exit the tunnel and enter the field. 

-5' - The national anthems are played, with the Brazilian national anthem first, followed by the Belgian one.

-1' - Players from both teams intermingle and stand in front of a ""Say no to racism"" banner. 

**First Half**

**1'** - [](#icon-whistle) Kickoff! Both teams in their home colours, Brazil in yellow and Belgium in red. 

**2'** - De Bruyne gets a shot away from over 30 yards, but it sails harmlessly wide.

**3'** - Neymar moves down the left channel and crosses in to the Belgium box, where it's gathered safely by Courtois.

**6'** - Only took 6 minutes for Neymar to end up on the floor. Not expecting this to be the last time we see that sight in this match.

**8'** - A Brazil corner is flicked off the head of Miranda and onto the feet of Thiago Silva two yards from goal, however he doesn't get a clean contact and it lobs onto the post! Belgium than get going down the other end, with Hazard getting a shot blocked. 

**10'** - Another Brazil corner finds Paulinho unmarked in the box, only for him to fluff his kick.

**13'** - [](#sprite6-p17) [](#icon-ball) [**GOOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLL!!!! BELGIUM!!!!!** And after Brazil's missed opportunities from their corners, Belgium score off one! Hazard's corner is flicked on by Kompany and hits the elbow of Fernandinho to leave Alisson wrong footed!](https://streamja.com/jegX)

**15'** - Brazil look for an instant response and almost get one!

**21'** - Hazard cuts in from the left and slips in a pass to an unmarked Meunier. He tries to find Lukaku inside the box but his cross is cleared by Miranda.

**26'** - A mishit cross by Marcelo heads straight towards the Belgium goal and has to be palmed away to safety by Courtois.

**28'** - Brazil are currently playing with 10 as Neymar is receiving treatment on the touchline.

**31'** - [](#sprite6-p17) [](#icon-ball) [**GOOOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLL!!!! BELGIUM!!!!!** A Brazil corner gets cleared by Fellaini and the ball falls to the feet of Lukaku. He holds the ball up, then turns and runs at the Brazil defence, slipping past three defenders before sliding in a pass to De Bruyne to his right. De Bruyne shoots from the edge of the area and finds the bottom left corner, leaving Alisson with no chance!](https://www.clippituser.tv/c/kaqzan)

**36'** - Jesus receives a cross unmarked in the box but heads wide. 

**37'** - [Courtois makes two saves in quick succession! First off a deflected cross from Marcelo, and then off a long shot from Coutinho after the resulting corner was played short.](https://www.clippituser.tv/c/mqndqp)

**41'** - [De Bruyne shoots at goal from a free kick at an angle wide left and it has to be tipped over by Alisson. Kompany gets on to the end of the resulting corner and backheels a shot on target, however it is straight into the hands of Alisson.](https://streamable.com/tf359)

**44'** - [Neymar goes down inside of the box after contact with Meunier, the referee is not interested and waves away his protests.](https://www.clippituser.tv/c/wxpqpp)

**45'** - There will be 1 minute of added time. 

**45+1'** -  [](#icon-whistle) **Half time: Brazil 0-2 Belgium.** An open, end to end first half saw both teams with multiple opportunities but Belgium have been far more clinical and lead 2-0.

**Second Half**

**46'** - [](#icon-whistle) We're underway again!

**46'** - [](#sprite6-p24) [](#icon-sub) Willian [](#icon-down) Roberto Firmino [](#icon-up)

**47'** - [](#sprite6-p17) [](#icon-yellow) The first yellow card of the match goes to Alderweireld for a foul on Paulinho to stop a counter after the latter regained possession.

**49'** - Another Belgium counter sees Lukaku 1 on 1 with Miranda, but the Brazilian defender is able to hold him off and shepherd the ball to Alisson.

**51'** - Marcelo whips in a cross from the left byline, it sails past Firmino's outstretched boot. 

**53'** - [Neymar goes down in the Belgium box again, and is told to get up by the referee. Replays show it was a clear dive and Neymar is lucky not to get booked.](https://www.clippituser.tv/c/rykekg)

**55'** - Paulinho, from an angle wide right, muscles his way past two Belgian defenders and gets a shot away, but it's saved by Courtois.

**56'** - [Brazil come again, with Jesus nutmegging Vertonghen from the right byline, and he then goes down after a sliding tackle from Kompany! The Brazilian players appeal for a penalty, the ref disagrees but decides to check with VAR. After a pause, he sticks with his original decision. No penalty.] (https://www.clippituser.tv/c/mqndnp)

**58'** - [](#sprite6-p24) [](#icon-sub) Gabriel Jesus [](#icon-down) Douglas Costa [](#icon-up)

**61'** - Belgium counter again, with Chadli and De Bruyne combining to find Hazard in space on the left. Hazard goes for goal and shot sails just past the far post. 

**62'** - Douglas Costa's shot is saved by Courtois and it falls right into the path of Paulinho, however he doesn't expect it and the ball deflects away from goal off his boot. 

**65'** - Neymar gets fouled by Alderweireld, he doesn't bring out any of his playacting antics this time due to the match situation. 

**71'** - [](#sprite6-p17) [](#icon-yellow) Meunier gets a yellow for hacking down Neymar. He will miss the semi-finals if Belgium qualify. 

**73'** - [](#sprite6-p24) [](#icon-sub) Paulinho [](#icon-down) Renato Augusto [](#icon-up)

**75'** - Douglas Costa runs down the right and gets a shot away, but it's saved by Courtois. The rebound falls to Neymar, and his shot is blocked.

"Messi full interview with TyC Sports: ""The truth is COVID hit me very hard. A lot of coughing, sore throat, fever. It left a lot of sequels. I came back to train after a month and a half and I couldn't even run because of my lungs. I started training before I should and it ended hurting me.""","Lionel Andrés Messi Cuccittini, Newell's Old Boys second most famous fan, [gave an interview to the Argentinians of TyC Sports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UfNd7pESho) before the clash of his beloved Argentina and Italy, the current European Champions, at Wembley. Yesterday [a small bit about Benzema and the Ballon d'Or](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/v11o19/tycsports_leo_messi_on_benezema_for_ballon_dor_i/) was published. Here's a transcription of the most relevant quotes of the rest of the interview. 
 
##Mbappé's comments about CONMEBOL.

>""Obviously outside of training we talked, but on this occasion we didn't talk. I didn't see how he said it, or what he exactly said. But it is a topic that many times we talked about with the guys in Spain, when we came back from the qualifiers and said: ""you know how difficult it would be for you guys to qualify for the World Cup if you had to go and play there?"" Colombia, the altitude, the heat, Venezuela.... They all have different conditions that make it much more difficult and apart from the fact that they are great teams, with great players. Football is becoming more and more equal, whatever the opponent, and I think we are ready to play against any European team and now we have a very nice test (against Italy)"".  
  
>""France is an impressive team, who at the time we were already saying they were a possible candidate and ended up being champions. I think the shock of the European Championship made them stronger, they grew as a team and realised many other things. And I think that for this World Cup they are going to be a team that is once again a candidate to be World Champions"".

##The Finalissima.

>""It's a nice test for us as well. They are the European champions, if they had been in the World Cup they would have been favourites. They were unlucky to miss out but they could have qualified earlier in the group, when they had the chance to win the match before going to the play-offs and they couldn't do it and then, because of football, they missed out on the World Cup. Surely they would have been one of the candidates: if they were in the draw, no one would have wanted to play Italy, so it's a great test for us, to keep growing, to keep improving and to keep reaching our objective, which is the first World Cup match, in the best possible way"".

>""The truth is that it's crazy that they (Italy) won the European Championship and are not in the World Cup. For Italy not to be in another World Cup, with what that means and what Italy is in the history of World Cups. It's a shame really. Now I also have team-mates and friends in the team, two great people with whom I have a very good relationship, who have helped me a lot since I've been there. Especially Verratti and it makes me even more sad"".

>""For them it should also be that way, they should take it that way. It's an official competition, endorsed by FIFA, one more cup for us and we want to win it and for this group to win one more cup for us personally, as a group and for the people of Argentina as well.

##Lewandowski

>""Everyone says what they want and obviously he can express himself and say what he wants. I honestly don't agree with what he said but I didn't give it much importance either. That's it, he can say whatever he wants and I'm not interested. But the words I said at the time were from my heart and because I really felt that way. I said that he deserved the Ballon d'Or before, because the year before I thought he had been the best, but the year I won it, he wasn't the best. I simply said that. But let him take it how he wants to take it.

##Agüero

>""We weren't really aware of what happened to him. I at least saw all happening from afar and I didn't understand the situation until I could talk to him and I really saw that it could have been a lot worse. But he is a special person, he has a different personality to everyone else and that made him take it the way he did. Obviously he must have suffered and cried in solitude or with his relatives, but luckily he quickly found another way and he is fine, he looks fine, he enjoys what he does, he does it without caring about anything because he doesn't care about anything and he says what he thinks. After having gone through that situation I guess it also made him be that way and well, luckily he seems fine.

>How do I miss him? Everything. I especially used to concentrate with him, I was with him all day long, we got up together, we went to bed together, and the truth is that yes, he is missed. I personally miss him a lot but I think the group misses him too. Even though he was a different Kun and he was calmer, he always made his presence felt"". 

##The boos from PSG fans  

>""It is new for me. It's a different situation. It had never happened to me at Barcelona, quite the opposite. It's understandable the people's situation and the anger because of the players we had, because of the team we were and because it happened for another year, because it's not the first time a situation like this has happened to Paris, being knocked out of the Champions League like that, and it's understandable the anger. Then, whether or not I agree with the whistles against me and Ney in particular, we were the ones who were most singled out. But well, it happened"".
 
>""I immediately asked what the kids had said, if they had seen it, what they thought or what they were saying and the truth is that I didn't like that my family was there and that they heard people whistling at me, and that my children were there and had to go through that. They didn't say anything to me, they kind of let it go. They didn't understand anything, because they don't realise why either. But I know they felt something.""

>""Thinking about myself, individually and about this year, I think about being able to reverse the situation, about not having the feeling of having changed clubs and not having done well. And as you said, I know that this year is going to be different, I'm ready for what's coming, I know the club, I know the city, I'm a bit more comfortable in the dressing room, with my teammates and I know it's going to be different.""

##COVID 19

>""The truth is that it hit me very hard. Symptoms very similar to most people I guess. A lot of coughing, sore throat, fever. It left a lot of after-effects. It left a lot of sequels on my lungs. I couldn't train. I came back after like a month and a half and I couldn't even run because it had affected my lungs."" 

>""I didn't panic, but well, they tell you so many things that they didn't let me start training. I started before I should have started and that was worse. Because I accelerated the process it ended up hurting me, and I couldn't take it any more. I wanted to go out to run, to train, and in the end it was worse. Then when I was halfway there, Real Madrid happened and that killed the team"".

##His motivation  
  
>""First of all I play for myself and to win, because I always wanted to win everything and I always wanted to give my best in every match, wherever I played. Then, with everything we went through with my family, with everything I know that they suffered during the time when I was hated in the national team and they had to endure a lot of things, where day after day they turned on the TV and heard people criticising me, or talking about things that weren't true, and they suffered a lot just like me. After winning the Copa America, I had to think about them. I knew how happy they were at that moment, just like I lived it and I passed it on. I continue to play for them, my children, my wife.  
  
##The 2026 World Cup

>""The other time I said that after this World Cup I will have to rethink a lot of things and I don't know. The truth is that I'm thinking about this one and then I'll see. Look at what happened now, I never imagined that I would end up playing anywhere other than Barcelona and from one day to the next I had to leave. Many things can happen, football is very changeable. And honestly I think it's very difficult, but I don't have anything settled in my mind.""  
  
##His tribute to Maradona  
  
>""I was the night before with Antonela, lying down and I was telling her, 'I have to do something for Diego'. And I have my museum section, with the trophies, shirts.... And I'm going to see what's there, I went to look for a national team shirt or something. And I went upstairs and there's a little door that's always closed, where we put things. And it was open and there was a chair, and on top was the #10 of that Newell's shirt. I went in and saw it. That door is always closed and I don't know what it was really doing there, I didn't even remember I had it. And I saw it like that and I said, 'that's it'. It was unbelievable. It was about 11 o'clock at night, we weren't concentrating. I was thinking about a national team shirt. It seems unbelievable.""  
  
##The new national team  
  
>""When we get together here, it seems that everything flows in a different way, that everything falls into place and each one of us knows what our role is and what we have to do on the pitch. We do whatever we have to do to try to win the game, whether it's better or worse. Obviously, I like to play and play well, to always have the ball, but if we can't and we have to do the other thing, we are also prepared for that. Because this national team is not just that, when they have the ball they also play very well. They know what they have to do with and without the ball"".

>""It's a collective that plays every game as if it were a final. The coaching staff prepares every game very well, and they know exactly what they are playing for and what they have to do at every moment of the matches, being a young group that's not easy and this group is very clear about all of that. It's a national team that can fight against anyone and that will make it difficult for any opponent, that doesn't mean that we are the candidates to be world champions, or anything like that, but it does mean that we will fight against anyone because we are prepared to play against anyone because we are clear about what we want to do"".

>""We know from experience that there are no easy opponents. And it happened to us last World Cup, when we also celebrated the group and in the end we ended up making things difficult for ourselves. Mexico is a team that has always cost us, that plays very well. Although we were generally lucky and we could have gone through or won, it's a team that plays very well, that has a very clear idea, with a manager who knows what Argentina is like, and they know us very well, and it's surely going to be a difficult group, just like the match with Poland. It's going to be tough throughout the World Cup, but obviously a priori, because of the names, I've always preferred the teams with lesser names to play ahead of you"".
  
##Sabella vs. Scaloni  
  
>""I think they both place a lot of importance on the defensive side, but without forgetting to think offensively and to always go out and win the game. We are noticing it more and more, not only in World Cups, Copa America, European Cups, but also in the Champions League, the leagues... that keeping a clean sheet always gives you a chance of winning, whatever the match or the opponent you have in front of you. Everything has become very tactical, very studied and with less and less space. Any team that is well organised or well organised can make a match difficult for you"".
  
##The 21/22 season changes
  
>""The truth is that it was something I never imagined. Everything that happened after the Cup, the joy I had after fighting for it for so long, having achieved something with the national team after many sad summers, having had a bad time, having lost finals. Today everything has changed, it was a different summer, where happiness was complete and where I had planned for everything to continue in the same way, as it had been the previous year in Barcelona... like all my life, right? And in the middle everything happened and it was hard, it was a hard change, a difficult year to be honest, because it wasn't easy to adapt"". 

>""After a lifetime of being in the same place, because it's not easy with the age I am because it's one thing to do it younger, or ready, or wanting to. At that time I didn't want it and I didn't imagine it and I didn't think about it, and the truth is that it was a difficult year. I had everything in Barcelona. I left when I was very young. What's more, I lived more in Barcelona than in Argentina. And I was very well off. The truth is that I wasn't thinking of changing anything"". 

>""Thiago understands the situation and perhaps keeps things to himself more, he never said anything, but even though he missed Barcelona and his friends, he adapted quickly. Mateo is the same, he's a different type of character, he's quicker to make relationships and he lets go more easily. And Ciro was also going to school for the first time, so he had no choice. Whether it was in Paris or Barcelona, it was the first time so he was the one we were least worried about. But luckily everything went well and that reassures us a lot"".

>""Luckily the kids' adaptation was spectacular. We were always afraid that the kids would have a bad time with the change. And it was the opposite. It was very easy, they adapted very quickly to school, to their friends, to everyday life. For Antonela and me it was more difficult. I remember the first day we took them to school was terrible. We both left crying. Saying what are we doing here, what happened. We didn't understand anything. But the truth is that the three of them were phenomenal"".

>""I also had to get used to a way of playing because I had been used to playing one way all my life and to come to a place where it's not the same, you play differently, you see football in a different way, with new team-mates... in Barcelona I had team-mates who had been playing alongside them for many years and they knew me by heart. This was all new to me. On top of that I started the league late because I arrived at the club late, then I had a blow to my knee that stopped me for a while and between one thing and another I couldn't get going. I couldn't play three or four games in a row. The holidays came and I said 'well, after this I'm starting a new year, I'm going to come back with all my batteries, I'm going to change, the adaptation is over', and Covid grabbed me"".",https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/v1yxbn/messi_full_interview_with_tyc_sports_the_truth_is/,LordVelaryon,2022-06-01 01:11:25,2458,soccer

FROM A PROFESSIONAL CHEF TO YOU: The tricks that anyone should know when they buy food.,"I wager everyone here knows some of these things, but I’m gonna list everything I can think of in regards to eating healthy and well. I’m gonna make this a list with sections, so hopefully it’s easy enough to parse.

—————-LEGUMES———————

-Buy these dried as often as possible. Keep a stock of beans, lentils, and dried chickpeas around if you can. They’re cheap, almost always available, and virtually imperishable. As such, assuming you don’t throw them out and keep them properly stored, buying these is a 100% return on your investment. 

-Legumes are one of the most versatile options in your kitchen. As long as you soak them and put them in the fridge before you go to bed they’ll be available the next day to cook quickly. These are the best thing to have if you’re looking to stretch a meal because of their nutrient density and the fact that they’re just damn delicious on their own. 

-Look into middle-eastern and African cuisine for creative ways to use these ingredients. Some really common examples are lentil curry, hummus, falafels, and putting chickpeas in a shakshuka. This isn’t a recipe post, so look up how to make them yourself - some grandma has a better (and probably even cheaper) recipe than I do.

————-GRAINS AND CEREALS ————

-Like legumes, these are very versatile. However, I find most people know very little about them outside of wheat and maybe oats. I highly recommend learning what the most commonly eaten grans and cereals in your locality are, and then finding the affordable ones. There will be at least one. I guarantee it. 

-FLOUR is an essential staple, unless you’re celiac or gluten free - a topic on which I won’t speak because I’m confident anyone who has to deal with those issues knows more than I do. I recommend grabbing all-purpose flour due to its gluten content being a middle ground between low-gluten pastry flour and high-gluten bread flour. You can still use it to make bread, and it has a myriad other uses as a binder or thickener for sauces. 

-RICE is amazing, as most know already, but seriously - it’s one of the most important crops in the world. It’s kept civilizations alive on its back for all of recorded history, and it’ll keep you alive, too. There is no better “fill me up” food I can think of.  Wait for those huge sacks of rice to go on sale (it happens pretty frequently), then buy 2. They last forever. Ideally grab long-grain rice if you’re just looking for a side-dish or fried rice base, but in a pinch short grain’ll do; it’s just less forgiving and the starches don’t retrograde as fully so when you cool it it doesn’t keep as nicely. 

-KEEP IN MIND that rice is pure carbs. It’s a good base, but you need other stuff to go with it or else you’ll be deficient in nutrients and feel awful all the time. Trust me from experience - college me went through a raw-egg-on-rice phase, and it wasn’t pretty. 

-BARLEY, also, is amazing, but for other reasons. It’s high in protein and iron, and can help dramatically improve your nutrient intake for very little cost. In soups, roasted in tea (thanks Korea), and used in tandem with rice, it can go a very, very long way in making your diet a more sustainable one in times of austerity and plenty, alike.

-AVOID “SUPERFOODS”. Not because they’re bad for you - just because of their jacked prices. Not to mention oftentimes the industries surrounding them are ethical nightmares. Don’t get me started on avocado cartels and the impact of quinoa farming on low-income South American communities. In reality, most grains and cereals have a lot of nutrients and minerals, and they’re often overlooked. Learn the nutrition facts, and make decisions accordingly. Google and online databases are your friends, here. 

———FRUITS AND VEGETABLES———

-ONIONS: buy them fresh and store them in dry, enclosed spaces, and buy tomatoes canned and without salt added. Use onions in almost everything, they’re delicious, cheap, and nutritious. 

-TOMATOES: Good fresh and better canned. Use fresh tomatoes raw for whatever you want and use canned tomatoes for sauces. Buy canned tomatoes with as little added salt and sugar as possible. 

- POTATOES: Treat these as a starch option similar to grains or cereals. Buy them unprocessed, in a sack.  Store them in dry, enclosed spaces. 

-BASICALLY EVERY FRUIT: go for it, these things are nutrient bombs and they’re delicious. Buy them seasonally for the best value and if you have a day to do so, preserve them if you ever see a huge sale. I’m still enjoying lacto-fermented blueberries from last year’s insane blueberry harvest where I could buy a pint for a dollar.

-FOR SHOPPING: Generally when you buy produce you should go, in order, to the discount rack, then the sales, and then everything else. Someone out there has a recipe for literally everything, and some of them are even good. A pepper with a blemish or tiny spot of mold is still fine, assuming you cut away the blemish or tiny spot of mold. 

-I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH; FIND THE UNDER-APPRECIATED AND OVER-SUPPLIED PRODUCE. There’s always a bin of some forgotten veggie no-one eats for some reason. In the west, at least, it seems to often be rutabagas/turnips. I’ve also seen apples in the fall, corn, and cabbages fall into this category. This is because of a good harvest, or because of a lack of consumer interest - any time this happens, capitalize on it. Everything is delicious if you cook it properly. Buy seasonally, and learn how to use the things you buy. You’ll eat like a king and pay like a pauper.

-CANNED STUFF - I generally have a personal aversion to all canned veggies and fruits except tomatoes, but that’s just my privilege speaking. If you want to buy them or if fresh produce is hard to come by, avoid getting anything with added salt or sugar. Cross-reference the nutrient info on the can with info from a fresh counterpart to avoid buying filler garbage, and try to find somewhere to live with better food accessibility. Alternatively, save up and make a killing by opening a fruit and vegetable market to remove the need to read this very ling post any further. (This is a joke and I recognize the struggle of those in impoverished communities with awful food accessibility.)

-FROZEN STUFF - frozen fruit and veg is great,
mostly. Maybe dodge the chopped carrots and corn a lot of us ate growing up or find in bad takeout Chinese food, but hey - grab that bag of frozen berries or peas and throw ‘em in anything that warrants it. Technology for frozen produce has improved dramatically in the last few decades, and we should capitalize on that.


——-PROTEINS——-

-IF YOU EAT MEAT, buy the least processed cuts you can. Whole chickens, meat on the bone, and ground meats are your best friends. Go to butcher shops, if you can. Freezing meat is fine, but try to avoid buying pre-made frozen protein options. Get raw product and do the work yourself to save a LOT of cash and get better food out of it.

-MEAT IS A LUXURY, NOT AN ESSENTIAL. I say this because in modern western culture eating meat everyday is seen as normal. This is an oddity when we examine all of human history, and this notion should be abandoned if we’re trying to live more affordably. Meat is grossly overrepresented in most diets, and you should always ask if you could cut your portion of meat down in exchange for more vegetables and grains.

-LEARN HOW TO BREAK DOWN YOUR PROTEINS. A chicken isn’t just 8 portions of meat - it’s also bones and carcass for a stock or soup, fat to be rendered out and used as a cooking oil (thanks, jewish folks!), and skin to be cooked down into delicious little chips. This same list can be used for
pork, beef, and any other mammal you eat. 

-FISH IS IFFY. Like, as an industry. Not many people know their fish, and fish processing companies know that and capitalize on it. I always tell people who like fish to buy fresh and whole, and to learn how to pick good fish. Buying cheap processed fish products is akin to asking to be ripped off, to harm the environment, and to accumulate toxins in your body, all at the same time. To not get completely F-ed over by what is maybe the worst food industry in the world you need to know your fish, know the company you’re buying from, and know who’s doing the fishing. Good luck, and please try not to contribute to the death of our water ecosystems. (A good trick is that if you can afford fish when you’re poor and you don’t live beside a large body of water, you almost certainly DON’T WANT IT.)

-IF YOU DO BUY FISH OR SEAFOOD, all the rules for proteins apply. Fish bones and crustacean shells for stock, fat deposits on the occasional salmonid for whatever you want, and fish skin, if it’s your cup of tea, for a lovely snack. Hell, fish organs and salt make up the base for a fermented fish sauce, if you really want to go the extra mile. Rome survived off of fish sauce and bread for longer than our society has been around. The one big difference between fish and meat is that frozen fish tends to suck relative to fresh in a much bigger way - both in terms of quality and retained nutrients. Put frozen fish in soups or curries, to avoid nutrient drain from the water that inevitably will leak out of your fish.

FOR VEGETARIANS AND VEGANS: You know more about your protein options than I do, and honestly they would require a lot of research I haven’t done to fully discuss. Clearly I have more to learn on the subject, and intend to do so. I only encourage you all to do the same ✌️

——-EVERYTHING ELSE——-

-STAY AWAY FROM THE INSTANT RAMEN. I know it’s cheap. I KNOW you like how easy it is. I don’t give one flying fuck. It’s awful for you, it isn’t cheaper than a bowl of rice with soy sauce, a fried egg, and some frozen peas, and it’ll kill you slowly. Just don’t, and ignore anyone’s advice about how it got them through college. Hell, if anyone’s advice involves doing what they did in college, take it with a grain of salt. There’s good advice sometimes, and a LOT of bad.

-AVOID THE JUNK FOOD AISLES. Chips, sugar cereals, premade salad dressings, sweet juice/pop, and processed foods like KD or tv dinners are not the way to go if you’re looking to get the most out of your dollar at the grocery store. They’re bad for you, they’re expensive relative to the cost of production, and they put a burden on your body that you’ll pay for down the line. Exceptions to this are staple sauces like a good soy sauce and fish sauce, grains and legumes, and canned veggies. 

-CHEESE IS A LUXURY, SO TREAT IT LIKE ONE. If you’re gonna buy it I recommend buying less of it less often, and buying the good stuff when you do. Kraft block cheese only costs as little as it does because it’s the by-product of the real money-maker: whey protein production. If you’re gonna buy cheese, please support a real cheesemaker. The cheese lover in you will be happier for it. 

-ALCOHOL IS ALSO A LUXURY. If you want a drink, I recommend doing it less often and drinking the good stuff. If you like the cheap stuff that’s fine, “good stuff” is all relative anyway. Just drink less and focus on quality over quantity, whatever your preferences are. 

-MAKE YOUR OWN COFFEE, AND BUY A THERMOS. I know Starbucks is delicious. Guess what? You can find a recipe for every drink they make online, and then make it better. Some restaurants literally survive because they can sell coffee at a nearly 2000% markup. Truck stop diners and high-end coffee shops do this. I recommend making cold brew the night before, since you literally just have to strain it in the morning rather than brewing a pot.

-FINALLY, LEARN TO COOK. All of this information is fundamentally more useful if you know how to cook. Not knowing how to cook is a luxury afforded to those with the means to afford living in ignorance of this most basic human skill. You are living outside your means if you live in a well-off country, don’t make a least $60k a year, and can’t cook. 


Best of luck to you all. Stay safe out there.

EDIT: A number of folks pointed out lots of things to me which I wasn’t aware of in regard to beekeeping, so I cut that section out as it was misrepresentative of the industry and failed to highlight key problems in it. Others felt I was being mean to vegans and vegetarians and regardless as to my intentions, I can see evidence that that whole section detracts from this list as a whole and isn’t informative enough to keep. I’ve removed it accordingly. Thanks for the feedback, positive or negative - keep doing good work ✌️

EDIT: Someone made a good point that grocery stores are all laid out different, and not everyone knows the “centre aisles” mantra. So I changed it to “Junk food aisles” for clarity.

EDIT: I somehow mistakenly said South African communities were effected by Quinoa production when in fact it’s primarily South American.

TIFU by drinking a Gallon of milk in one hour to shove it in Reddit’s face,"It’s still in my post history because I am permanently keeping it as a reminder that I’m a fucking idiot whenever my ego gets out of check. 

Okay so this morning I posted on Reddit a conversation me and my friends had in which we all unanimously agreed that drinking a gallon of milk in under an hour is 100% possible and is an incredibly easy challenge. My reasoning was that an entire hour is a lot of time, and that if you just slowly and steadily drink the milk while portioning yourself there’s no reason why anybody can’t do it. One of the lesser challenges was doing a half gallon in an hour and I can say from a certain experience with hot sauce a while ago that I was 100% capable of achieving that so I was absolutely confident I could do two.

I posted it to Reddit, feeling pretty high and mighty of myself on the “unpopular opinions” board and was immediately provided with multiple comments informing me that I was an idiot and had no idea what I was talking about. These comments from inferior humans asked me to record my endeavors and I was without a doubt ready and willing to prove them wrong. So I went to my local 7/11, bought a gallon of 2% and got back to my dorm. 

I will give myself credit through my naive ego, I did prepare for the worst a little bit, I sat with a towel bib in case of dribblage and pre-opened one of the shower stalls because the toilets would not account the possible gallons worth milk that could occur from the bovi-licious odyssey I was about to traverse upon. So I turned on my video camera and filled up 5 approximately 25 ounces cups of milk. 

Looking at these completely full cups infront of me, the milk carton definitely tricks you with its sheer volume and I was realizing the challenge ahead of me, but mama didn’t raise no bitch so I went in.

First cup: Totally easy, I love milk, my father, brother and I will go through a gallon within 2-3 days tops, and all I have to do is do this every 12 minutes and I’m home free and all those losers on Reddit will know how cool I am.

Second cup: I down this one too, easy peasy, though the first signal to my brain that I was very much so satiated with my daily value of calcium was already upon us. Though this was a challenge even the greatest often failed at, I wasn’t going to underestimate this challenge, but rather like a matador I will corral this bull with steadiness and finesse.

Third cup: this one I was able to not consistently down, I got about half way through and I had to breathe for a second. But I have a 12 minute window to down this so I don’t have to rush it. The camera is still recording, I wonder if I have to post this full hour of footage to prove it or if I can just skip to each time I drink. Ha. Imagine the looks on their faces when they see I can drink an entire gallon. How much time till my next cup? IVE GOT 30 SECONDS?! 

Fourth cup: OKAY! I FINISHED THE THIRD CUP IN THE TIME WINDOW! The 12 minute mark hit and I didn’t immediately drink it, I picked it up, inspected it’s beautiful color and temperature, and immediately had to put it back down because a certain noise just befell my ears... did my stomach just... hiccup? Me and humbleness have a very long distance relationship, and as the crazy zodiac girl in my nursing classes has informed me, “you totally DO give off Leo energy”. And while my understanding of stars is lacking I think that translates to at this very moment, I definitely have gotten myself into a bad scenario thanks to my ego”. I begin to drink the fourth cup and my stomach is really starting to slosh around, it’s just stagnant and sitting in there and I can feel it truly filling up. SOMEHOW, BY SHEER MIRACLE OR LUCK, I get cup 4 down within the time window with a few minutes to spare. 

Fifth cup: ALL. I. DID. WAS. BURP. A very small burp, but up with it came a mouth full of milk. I realized my fate was sealed. As I swallowed it back down I knew that the second part of the challenge was actually sitting there and not puking as the body begins to naturally break down the lactose and shit in the milk. I haven’t even touched the fifth cup yet, just decided to bring my knees up to my chest to help with the completely full stomach... then, I, very graciously I should add, sprinted like a mad man to the open shower, kneeled on that gross ass floor and prepared for the inevitable. 10 seconds.. 15... nothing was happening... so I slowly got up and went to head back to my room to hopefully finish the challenge, and THEN I BUMPED THE STALL DOOR RIGHT INTO MY GUT. 

In that moment I saw two things, the white of the milk projectile ejecting from my mouth into the shower floor from my rapidly turning head as to not destroy everything. And the vision of God punishing me for the next probably 40 years because I attempted to achieve the ways of the golden calf. 

It is now 5 hours later, and Reddit has won this time with their stupid facts and basic science that I chose to ignore. I am still making frequent trips to the bathroom with generous supplies of dairy for the toilet from both ends. If you need me I will be listening to “I told you so’s” from the toilet. 

Tl;dr: I try to best Reddit by drinking a whole gallon of milk and now my stomach is churning to the point that I may shit butter

Edit: It has been only two hours and so far I have seen many people read this story, understand my overconfidence within it, and then comment that they bet they could personally do the challenge themselves and will be trying soon, which makes me feel better knowing that I am not ill for this world. Thanks guys!

[Spoilers] Epilogue: After The Wheel,"In the long years of his reign, King Brandon Stark was not loved by the smallfolk nearly so much as the quietude of his rule. Bran himself was a distant and near-silent king, with no taste for great celebrations or inspiring rhetoric. But when the Driftwood Queen demanded the independence of the Iron Islands in 313 AC, Bran granted it almost immediately; the expanded fleet that the Greyjoys had long laboured over had hardly left its harbours before the raven returned from King’s Landing. Dorne’s autonomy grew not with violence, but with carefully negotiated partnership, and though now Ornelia Martell is styled the Princess of Dorne, the Maesters of Oldtown would say that the lands beyond the Red Mountains are more closely entwined – through trade and goodwill – with the Five Kingdoms than ever before. It is said that, though the Seven Kingdoms became Six through the sacrifice of a million lives, the Six became Five without a single drop of spilt blood.

These years of calm saw the turn of seven long summers and seven mild winters. The external threats to Bran’s reign – the Braavosi blockade of 309, sponsored by the Iron Bank and facilitated by many mercenaries; the Second Crossing of the Dothraki Khalasar in 318; the Septons’ Rising of 331 or the coming of the Red Refugees in the decade afterward – seemed less desperate in comparison to the crises endured by King’s Landing in the warlike years before, as if an invisible hand were directing events, by slight nudges, toward the ends of stability and prosperity. Though terrible battles were rumoured in many parts of Essos, their effects were seldom felt in Westeros. One might also have expected some friction to arise from the King’s worship of the Old Gods, but Bran’s habits were so private, and his style of rule so tolerant, that for a time it seemed impossible that internal strife and religious discord could ever have been the hallmark of the Six – and then the Five – Kingdoms.

The absence of vengeful dragons surely helped. There are folk in Volantis who, in exchange for a cup of sweet wine, will tell the tale of their fathers or grandfathers catching sight of a great winged creature that obscured the waning moon in its eastbound flight, high above the city. Some of the Ghiscari traders who can now be so frequently found in Planky Town or Storm's End tell a similar story: that in the cold night after the death of the Dragon Queen, her last child, screaming with anguish, caused many a night-time watcher to return to their decks in great haste. Daenerys was carried far into the east, perhaps as far as the Shadowlands or the unknown forests of Ulthos. What became of her remains is not known. Some say the creature flew until fatigue brought it plummeting into deep, uncharted waters. Others suggest that reports of dragons - fleeting glimpses, disappearing livestock, bone-chilling cries in the lonely places of the world - are not always the product of fancy or hysteria.

Bran outlived every member of his original Small Council, and outlasted – as far as can be known for certain – every other Stark. Of his sister Arya, the Hero of Winterfell, little was ever heard again: she sailed West, beyond the reckoning and knowledge of all, within days of her brother’s coronation, leaving only the rumours that are shared and rendered into stories in every town of Westeros and Essos: of a single, ragged-looking Raven that flew out of a storm over the Western Sea decades later and on to the last high tower of the Red Keep, bearing a message whose contents were seen only by the King and his closest advisors. The tale that is most often told is that Arya reached the land that is West of West, and shared what details she could of the wonders and terrors she found there before meeting her own mysterious fate. What is certainly true is that, slowly and deliberately, Bran has been fortifying the Western coast of the Five Kingdoms throughout the latter part of his reign. 

Sansa Stark, the Queen in the North, maintained strong relations with her brother’s kingdom and toward the end of her life was frequently to be found in the courts of King’s Landing or Dorne, having inherited from her mother a preference for the warmth. After her passing in 371 her bannermen selected Harrold Royce to rule the North.

Of the fate of Jon Snow – the Bastard of Winterfell, the Half-Stark, the Queenslayer, the Resurrected, the Friend of Wolves, twice named Lord Commander of Castle Black – very little is known. The Hand of the King, Tyrion Lannister, visited the North and the Wall in the first decade after Snow's return to the Night’s Watch. Of that visit he records that the Wall was all but unmanned, and that those who stood upon it were facing south, rather than north. The Hand was told that Jon Snow had, years earlier, gone forth with a great company of wildlings and northerners, disappearing into the dark forests of the Lands of Always Winter. Their exploration of those unmapped places are the subject of much conjecture: that Snow had been named the King Beyond the Wall, that he had made contact with the last enclaves of the Children of the Forest, that he was overseeing the settling of great underground cities among the twisting, interconnected roots of the Weirwood trees. It is said that the Greyjoys know something of those northernmost lands, and that Sansa Stark, before her death, knew more, but would not tell. The Lonely King, Bran the Broken, Bran the Bridgemaker, Bran the Wheelbreaker, surely knew more still – but in his quiet places and sanctuaries around King’s Landing, he seldom spoke a word, and to each successive Hand and Archmaester he entrusted fewer of his thoughts.

Finally, in 382 AC, at the start of his eighth winter, King Brandon embarked upon a final journey. He had aged but slowly in all the years of his reign, but age had come upon him nevertheless. His Kingsguard escorted him on the first leg of his journey – a secretive consultation followed by long weeks of contemplation or reading in Oldtown – and then took him as far as the Wall when at last he travelled North. After a night in the almost uninhabited Castle Black, Bran ordered the Kingsguard to return to Winterfell, and so on to the Five Kingdoms, where they were to supervise the selection of a new King of Westeros.

The last of the Starks then travelled North, beyond the wall, quite alone. The Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch reported that distant figures joined the King’s horse just before it disappeared into the treeline. No sight or word of King Bran has been heard in the long years since.

The winters are deeper now, and though King’s Landing is again fair and no great wars have troubled Westeros for many decades, some of the world’s wonder has diminished since the end of the time of Bran the Wheelbreaker.

Is this the hottest wing you have?,"I used to own a wing joint. Nothing fancy, but a good selection of wing flavors and beer. 

Inevitably we would have people come in and order the suicide wings (I like super spicy foods, so these were pretty damn hot). Of those people, about 5-10% would always start the joke/sarcastic conversation ""These aren't that hot. Can't you do better?!?"" Yuk, yuk, yuk. 

One of my best regulars, a dentist who fancied himself a gardner, decided to help us out and planted a ghost pepper bush (at the time the hottest pepper in the world) and he could bring us the bounty of his harvest. And he would intentionally under water the bush so the peppers would be as hot as they could be...

When he would bring us the peppers, I would grind them (seeds and all) into a nice paste which I would combine with our suicide sauce and keep to the side for when our spicy wing coneseurs would show up and complain about the suicide sauce not being hot enough. 

I would only serve them one Death Head wing (seemed a fitting name). I would make them wear gloves to eat it to prevent capsaicin burns on their skin. I would specifically tell them about the heat they were about to get into, trying to dissuade them from eating this culinary monstrosity. 

By the time we got through all this, every single person always now viewed this as an insult to their manhood (never had a woman complain about heat, but would sometimes actually ask if there was another level they could try) and could not be stopped from eating this wing...

So they did...
The fun thing about capsaicin oil is it can often take a few seconds to kick. Usually just enough time for the person to scarf down the wing and start to smuggly tell us how it wasn't that hot...

And then the heat would begin. And once it started it was relentless. 

The wing was free, but the cup of milk after was $20.
I never had a single person ask for a second one.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/ny74j6/is_this_the_hottest_wing_you_have/,19NotMe73,2021-06-12 18:47:09,37423,MaliciousCompliance

We very randomly just came across this tarantula near our house. There was a tarantula wasp circling it on the ground, and I remember reading about this, so we reckon it was in the process of dragging the tarantula paralysed back to a den, to lay its egg inside it.

I’m terrified of spiders, but have become quite attached to the tarantulas we find around our garden and house… We killed the wasp, and brought the tarantula inside in a box. I’m unsure how long it will remain paralysed, and what/ if anything we can do to help it? Also, what kind is this? We had one in our house the other day. They look different from the Peruvian blues we’ve previously found.

Thank you for ANY advice. Oh we are in the Andes of Peru. 3000meter altitude.

*Someone offers their assistance in a discord server:*

>**OOP:** Yes PLEASE! It’s moving it’s front legs very very slightly. I’m hoping it will get better soon. I found an article on Google with a guy taking care of one for 40 days. I don’t know shit about spiders and I’m so scared of them 😂

*Water:*

>**OOP:** We will give it a few drops water each day, and I’m hoping it won’t be too long before it starts moving, but who knows! We’re in it now that’s for sure 😅

**Mini Update in Comments: March 1, 2024 (Next Day)**

Thanks for all the comments on this post. We live in an area where there are *a lot* of hawk wasps. At times we can’t be on the terrace because of it. We had another blue tarantula take cover from 2 wasps a few weeks ago in the corner of our terrace.

We honestly didn’t think about everything in the situation. We kind of just reacted. I am a mama to a VERY animal loving 9 year old, that will jump into a swimming pool to save a bee, and has done so many times.

He asked if we could not save the tarantula without killing the wasp, but I didn’t know how. I was scared to piss off the wasp, and with a baby on my arm, and as someone that’s been bitten by a Bullet Ant before, I was not so willing to take a chance with an insect that has a Schmidt’s scale sting of 4. Just below the ant. And definitely not with my children around.

So we made a choice and now we have the consequences. And a 9 year old that is heavily invested and who will remember this forever. Google says that the tarantula will die regardless as respiration will eventually stop, but I’m hopeful since we’re not the first to try this. I can’t get discord to work for me right now though, so we need all the help we can get.

[Yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/tarantulas/s/7jV0DL0gDb) we found a tarantula that’s been paralysed by a hawk wasp. It was mid transportation to it’s den.

After reading an article online we now know this might last a while, so please help this arachnophobe make it a makeshift home. The kids are heavily invested in the recovery. Right now it is in a cardboard box. Someone also sent me a link to discord where a guy has been through this, but it’s not working for me. Any help deeply appreciated.

We are high up in the mountains of the Andes in Peru (about 3000m/9800ft) and far away (atleast 3 hours) from any kind of shop that would be able to help us, so this is a case of make do with what we have.

I’m comforting myself with the fact that this is the spiders natural habitat, and so temperature stuff should be accounted for in that sense I hope.

Yesterday it seemed to move it’s front legs ever so slightly, but this morning it’s *completely* still. I’d think it dead if I didn’t know better.

Picture of spooder that still needs a name! Any suggestions? Also still very interested in knowing the species if anyone can tell.

And picture of glass bowl with wooden lid that I am thinking will have to make do as far as a terrarium goes. What do we put in it that we can find outside?

**Title:** Paralysed tarantula has a new home

So a few people asked me to keep you updated on out rescued hawk wasp stung paralysed spooder. Thank you for the advice on my other threads. We found a plastic tub in the small town today and have made holes in the lid and the top of the sides of the tub.

We’ve filled it with Earth and plants from outside, and some bark and rocks. He/she is now living their best paralysed life on the shelf. Should I lay it on the dirt itself? Or a piece of paper of some sort? Or is it okay on the rock.

We fed it water today to the best of our ability and saw a teeny tiny movement of one leg whilst that happened. So it’s still alive! Ongoing concern that it might die and we wouldn’t notice cause it would still just not move.

Also, we think it might be some kind of Peruvian blue tarantula, so it’s aptly been named Bluey, which is good for my arachnophobia, as we do love that show and it doesn’t seem so scary.

Anyways, any further tips, thoughts or feedback much appreciated! 🙏🏽

**Title:** 1 week update: Bluey the (hawk wasp) paralysed tarantula

Hi everyone! A little update from Bluey the paralysed tarantula and his humble human servants.

No news from the western front, which in this case might be as good as it gets for a while..

We’ve given him/ her some extra quiet time the past three days, and haven’t given water or anything, since I felt bad after someone said it was really stressful for them to be handled, and I’d been giving him water every day which meant he was being ‘handled’ every day. But I’ve kept an eye on the habitat because I’ve got weird anxiety that some other insect will get into it, and start eating him.

Well today, I thought it good to try to give him some water again, but it doesn’t seem like much is happening. I’m hoping 1-2 droplets finds it way.

Other than that, Bluey is still his own paralysed self and we aren’t seeing any movements at all yet.

Today when inspecting the habitat I saw a little speck of mold from some organic material in the earth from outside, so everything had a cleaning, and he has new soil etc. I think we might need to change everything every 5-7 days just to be sure. This weekend we’re going away, and I’m having mild anxiety thinking of him being unsupervised 😂

Obligatory pictures of Bluey and new soil for Reddit tax.

**Title:** 18 day Update on Bluey the hawk wasp paralysed tarantula

Bluey is hanging in tightly here on day 18. We are slowly but surely seeing a bit more movement of legs when we give water every few days.

Still not sure if Bluey is really drinking any of the water that we are hand dripping with a dropper, but we are positive in regards to recovery, seeing the tiny flexion of a leg or two now when handling 🙏🏽

How much time can we let pass before we have to think about ways to feed Bluey?

A quick update on Bluey! Bluey is still paralysed. Going on day 32. About a week ago I thought we were seeing more movement, but alas we are back to zero. I cannot tell you why though, but I have an inkling it’s moving in the right direction.

We are still only feeding water, and doing it only every 3-4 days to limit handling. I can’t see any change in appearance since we found them, so I take that as a good sign atleast.

But, as time goes by, I am now beginning to more seriously contemplate how we get food in them if we need to. How long can we go without trying to feed? And how do we feed a paralysed tarantula? Please explain it like I’m 5.

Anyways, Bluey is hanging in there! Picture taken through the plastic container as we had no handling today but I wanted to give an update :)

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/tarantulas/comments/1c10851/day_42_update_on_bluey_the_hawkwasp_paralysed/) **6: April 10, 2024 (10 days later)**

**Title:** Day 42 update on Bluey the hawk-wasp paralysed tarantula!

An update on our housing and, hopefully, rehabilitation of Bluey that was stung by a hawk wasp in our garden 42 days ago.

Today we gave Bluey water again and something strange is going on!

When I turned Bluey over to give them water with our dropper, We saw something tiny stuck in its mouth. I quickly removed it as I thought it was some kind of small stone I had accidentally placed Bluey in top of after our last watering, but to our big surprise, it was a tiny, hard, completely dry woodlouse!

Also today we saw more movement of legs than we have accumulative within the last 42 days! 6, I repeat, SIX legs were slowly, slightly moving at once!!!

So, now the question is: did Bluey somehow feed themself in their very limited paralysed state as a woodlouse came too close to their mouth? (And I am shook if this is what happened, because 1: i haven’t seen any insects in the habitat at any point in time. 2: this must then have been the worlds most unlucky woodlouse, as it must have almost wandered directly into blueys mouth, because: 3. Bluey has NOT moved from their rock even a milímeter in the time we’ve had them)…

… OR can tarantulas regurgitate food? Like I’m thoroughly confused as to how that insect got into their mouth. It was sucked DRY.

You can see the tiny woodlouse in the picture right in front of bluey.

Anyways, today may have been the most positive we’ve been in 42 days. Seeing so much twitching and slow movement of legs has got us EXCITED for the progress!

***OOP clarifies:***

I haven’t seen them move the fangs, but we did see a lot of movement yesterday so I can’t say it hasn’t happened. The woodlouse was like, IN it’s mouth, maybe I should have left it.

*How long the venom lasts:*

No one really knows. It depends on the type of wasp. The one Bluey was stung by, is the type with the most severe venom. Some people say they can’t rehabilitate, and will inevitably die- but it’s mostly theoretical as there haven’t been many that have observed the effect. There’s a guy on instagram tgat rehabilitated a tarantula. It took between 35-60 days for the venom to wear off. But theoretically it could be as long as 8-9 months

**Title:** Bluey update (day 49): A very scary not so scary night

So today we came home from a small overnight trip. We’ve been away since yesterday and had asked our cleaner to come by. I’ve told her about Bluey before and to just leave them and not use any chemicals close by.

When we arrived home today I could immediately tell that she had sprayed insecticide since all the flies that come in when we have open doors, we’re gone. My heart sank.

Went upstairs and looked into blueys habitat and found them curled up looking limb, \[limp\] half on the rock/ half down on the ground. Usually Bluey is sat firmly on the rock at the edge with legs spread out in a natural stance. Looked like the death curl I’ve seen in this sub multiple times. Asked my husband what to do, and since it’s late we decided to wait to tell the kids till tomorrow.

I quietly cried after tucking our toddler in for bed, trying to figure out how to host a tarantula funeral and how to tell the kids, and then carried the habitat downstairs.

In the kitchen I opened the habitat to put Bluey back on the rock so the position wouldn’t look so scary tomorrow when breaking the news.

To my surprise, Bluey was not limb. Not limb at all.

I put them down on the dirt in the habitat and immediately there was movement. To say that I SOBBED would be an understatement.

Since yesterday, Bluey has pooped on their rock, and tried to WALK. Whilst trying to climb down the Little Rock they usually lay on, Bluey must have fell on top of their own legs (looking like a death curl), and didn’t have the capacity or strength to pick themself up again.

There is SO MUCH more reaction coming from Bluey now than ever during the last two months. I realised that Bluey flinched/ moved when they felt my breath. I CRIED.

Anyways, I’m attaching a short film of the moment we saw bluey flinch when he/she felt my breath.

This spooder has to pull through. It just has to. Because I cannot deal with it if it doesn’t. Tonight was too much for my system.

I never ever ever ever in my life thought you could get this attached to a spider. And even less so, that *I* would get this attached to a spider. Nevertheless here we are, and Bluey just needs to go ahead and recover now so I can live in mental peace again.

*\[editor's note- there is a video of Bluey on this post\]*

**Title:** Bluey Update: the wasp paralysed tarantula day 68

Another watering day for Bluey. We are officially on day 68 of paralysis.

Today my eldest held Bluey during the ordeal, as I didn’t have any more big cotton pads left that we usually use. We aren’t seeing any movement around the habitat, but as you can see there is a lot more movement in legs than ever before.

Todays watering sponsored by wooden chopsticks as we’ve misplaced our dropper.

We are still hopeful that Bluey will pull through at some point, and be ready to get back into the wild.

If someone has a guess on the sex of Bluey, it’s much appreciated at this point!

*\[editor's note- another video on this post! Bluey is twitching their legs and folding them in and out.\]*

*Bluey is theorized to be female in the comments, but her species continues to be unknown:*

>**OOP:** NOT Bluey. So now that we have established that Bluey is a female, in case she recovers, would it be okay to release her into the same territory near a small den on our terrace where I’m pretty sure this one lives? Assuming this is a male. He’s been in our house twice and in our washing room, roaming about, and I’ve relocated him to the rocks with the ‘den’ and he immediately crawls into the same hole. I don’t know how much space tarantulas need, and if it would be better to release Bluey far away, in case she recovers at some point.

**Title:** Bluey the hawk wasp paralysed tarantula day 104

A few days ago we passed day 100 of caretaking Bluey, who was stung, probably multiple times, by a hawk wasp right before we found her outside our garden.

The past 1-2 months her shaking has subsided (which can be seen on my last video) and her movement when we give her water seem more coherent and slow.

She is not yet moving around her habitat, and I got the feeling that she can not yet hold her own body weight or maybe her body is still paralysed even though her legs can now move. So she’s only moving her legs when she’s on her back so far have no water, and not when she’s ‘right side up’.

So today I tried lightly lifting her body weight for her with a chopstick, and sure enough, she then started trying to walk, very slowly, but I’ll take what I can get. So I think we are moving into a next phase of quite literally rehabilitating her by encouraging movement with some help 😅.

If she doesn’t recover enough in the next 3 months time to be released back into the wild, then we face a new problem of us leaving Peru for an extended period and what then to do with her.

So if anyone knows of any tarantula keepers in the Cusco area of Peru (we are happy to transport her there or anywhere in the vicinity), then that might be a solution if she isn’t her best self yet at that point. Please feel free to reach out!

But anyways, all in all, Bluey is still hanging in there!

*\[editor's note- another video of Bluey\]*

***Comments:***

Commenter: Yay Bluey!! I wonder if you can get her one of those small toy skateboards for her to rest her body on so she can work on using her legs without holding the weight of her body?

>**OOP:** Omg. We are 1000% doing this! My son has a hotwheels skateboard!

*Feeding her:*

>We haven’t been feeding her yet as her abdomen still looks a decent size and someone said that feeding might hurry up a molt, which she wouldn’t survive. She isn’t moving her pincers much yet. I see very slight moving when giving her water. Every few days we will take her out and place her on her back and put drops of water directly into her mouth which she kind of sucks in.

*OOP's fear of spiders:*

>We’ll I’ve always been extremely scared of spiders. Like, refusing to sleep in a room if there was ANY spider there. I never ever ever ever thought I would be able to stay in the same room as a tarantula. I remember a Americas next top model episode from like 20 years ago where the models had tarantulas crawling on them and it was traumatic!  
Now, I don’t feel scared of tarantulas anymore. I am able to handle wild ones with my hands if I find one that needs relocating. And it’s sort of rubbed off on other spiders. I can’t hold others than tarantulas and jumping spiders, but I’m not deadly afraid of them anymore either and am okay with them living in my space.

*OOP adds:*

A funny added comment to this post:

After a few comments about some tarantula YouTubers in Peru atm, I looked at their socials, and they’ve posted multiple photos of blueys species saying it’s unknown, and they may get to name it because they discovered it 😂

Makes better sense why I haven’t had luck identifying her with pictures online!

**Title:** Update day 113: Bluey the (sk8ter) hawk wasp paralysed tarantula.

Houston, we have forward movement, I repeat, we have forward movement! One small step for tarantulas, one giant step for Bluey!

It seems the hot wheels skateboard (where is our sponsorship?) we decided to try out to help encourage Bluey to start walking (after I realised last week she was having difficulty holding her body weight and coordinating her legs whilst right side up) has done the trick!

I got out my camera to film for you lovely people, but Bluey decided she wanted to show us her own trick of CRAWLING down the skateboard. She then continued to very slowly scoot/ move herself forward on the table afterwards, essentially walking, just really slowly.

This is the first time we have seen this kind of movement from her, and I am beyond amazed! I am truly truly truly feeling optimistic that she will make a full recovery.

Yay Bluey the sk8tergiiirl!

Also unsure if there’s sound on video, but in case there is, excuse toddler noises in the background.

*\[editor's note- in the attached video, Bluey is perched on the skateboard. She is moving her legs!\]*

**Title:** Community call for action: help me find Bluey a home (for the future).

Okay, so I feel like we are going two steps forward and one step back. 14 days ago Bluey was finally starting to snail her way forward when let loose on the living room table. Now it seems our paralysis *Queen* has decided that walking is for peasants, and has just decided not to do it. She CAN move, and will move if you blow on her, but she won’t walk. It’s giving *attitude* honestly.

Anyways, as I’ve mentioned briefly before, we will be leaving Peru in a few months, and the prospect of Bluey deciding that the life of special needs tarantula is better than wild tarantula is *stressing me*. If she does not fully rehabilitate before we leave we will have no choice but to put her down.

So, I am reaching out to you, dear redditors and Bluey cheer squad, to please help me find a solution. We would be able to transport her very many places in Peru if it’s possible to find a tarantula enthusiast that would be willing to take on this special needs queen. I really do believe she will recover and become as pleasant a pet as any tarantula ever was, but she may not be able to do it within the timeframe we have. Then there the slight chance that she may recover but will be wonky for the rest of her life, which would only make her suitable for a ‘pet’ life, and not being released into the wild again.

I’d even be willing to transport her to the United States, if anyone can help me figure out how to get through that process, and if there was a home for her there. We would be able to take her with us to Florida.

I know Bluey is semi paralysed still, but she really is a lovely little creature and I suspect a bit of a diva after being pampered for 5 months. I’m pretty sure she could both do a defensive stance and shoot her hairs if she wanted to, but she seems very content with all handling, flipping, skateboarding and whatever else she’s been subjected to the last 5 months in our care.

We cannot in any shape way or form keep taking care of her after we leave. We will be in the road without a Homebase.

ETA: Seems like I only need to post on Reddit and call her a *lazy queen with attitude*. Now she took a stroll across the table without anyone noticing.

**Title:** Update day 162: Bluey the hawk wasp paralysed tarantula

Sorry for going so long without an update, life has been overwhelming lately, but, Today Bluey has graduated from her tiny enclosure to a bigger one. The past few weeks I’ve noticed she has started to move around her habitat, but when she reached the edges she’d stop altogether, so today we moved her in the hopes that it will motivate more movement.

She is still recovering. But moving more. More coherently but still slow. She isn’t dragging as much anymore though, so we are still seeing progress.

We are still feeding her water directly into her mouth every few days, but I’ve also started leaving a little waterbowl for her in her enclosure.

We still need to put in some more vegetation, which I will get from the mountain today, but we’ve tried to replicate the outside as much as possible with what’s happening in wintertime atm. We’ve also tried to do the substrate in 3 layers so it’s the same as outside.

I am still hoping she could be ready for the wild before we leave, but I’m looking for someone local to take over care in case she isn’t. It seems that all tarantulas are in some sort of hibernation atm as we haven’t seen any in the wild since like April or may. The tarantula wasps have been gone in the same period. Basically since the fall/winter hit.

I’m thinking they must be coming out again around October/ November some time.

Anyways, hoping to get a movie of her soon walking so you can all be kept up to date :)!

**Title:** Update day 182: Bluey the hawk wasp paralysed tarantula

So I tried to post earlier, but it doesn’t seem to have gone through 😩

It’s been a while since I updated you all so thought I’d make a proper update. Bluey moved into her new and bigger habitat some weeks ago. She’s been laying very quiet again, but seems to have begun exploring the last few days. Which begs a new question to you all:

How much do you expect your normal non-paralysed tarantulas to move around each day? I’m feeling unsure if Bluey is actually behaving like a normal tarantula at this point.

She can definitely walk, and has started regaining some quicker movements as you can see when she flinches in the video annoyed by my chopstick. She has learned to live with me. I think she believes me an acquired taste.

I’ve taken to herding her around a bit to help her regain some strength and mobility- not that I ever thought I’d be able to add tarantula strength coach to my resume.

Maybe she’s ready for us to start to try and feed her? She has started crawling up and down the rocks which is definitely a positive and her movements look better than ever.

On another positive note, we’ve decided to come back here to the Andes in December and will only be gone for 6 weeks. If shes not released before that, I’m hoping it won’t be too difficult to find a temporary carer,- she is very low maintenance as far as pet goes.

**Title:** Update day 191: Bluey the hawk wasp paralysed tarantula

Good morning!

A little update and some reflections from us. Bluey seems to be making rapid progress now. I’m unsure if I’m seeing a lot of poop in her enclosure. Like small white spots that I haven’t noticed before.

Bluey is moving a lot at night. Every morning she is wedged up against a new side of her tank. I think she’s hungry. We’ve tried giving her flies but she has zero interest.

Also, you can’t see it in the picture, BUT SHE HAS STARTED WEBBING HER ENCLOSURE!!! Like, all over the bottom of the tank, spread from in between the rocks, there is webbing. I don’t know if they’d use this in the wild to trap food, but I am actually almost crying seeing this progress and knowing her spinners work (what are they called?).

Anyways, we will try capturing a cricket and giving it to her, but honestly I am starting to wonder if this little spooder would be better off at this point to be brought up the mountain and re-released in a secluded spot without humans (I’m scared she’d not be scared of humans and would come to close and be stomped). If we are getting close to an actual release, should we find a rocky place? A hole? How do we find a habitat with best conditions for survival?

Photo of her position this morning.

**Title:** Bluey update day 193: WE HAVE A MOLT!!!!!!!!

Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the new and improved Bluey!!

We have a successful molt (as far as i Can Tell).

Bluey has been laying quiet the last 24 hours and was not a fan of me trying to move her last night. This morning we woke up to weird creases in her abdomen (see prior post), and we felt it was probably molt time. Less than 4 hours later we HAVE A MOLT!

Look at her! Very demure, very mindful. We are thinking she will be ready for a release next week before we travel. We have thought of a great spot for her. 15 minutes away, there’s a part of the mountains here in the Andes that turn into a protected national reserve. We’ll make her a home there and release her to make babies now that spring is hitting.

We will ofcourse make sure that she is 100% before we do anything :)!

**Title:** Day 200: The re-release of Bluey, the hawk wasp paralysed tarantula.

Today, is the day. Coincidentally day 200 since we found Bluey, and the day before we start our travels for the coming months.

Bluey has been more active since molting and has reacted to us more like a normal tarantula I think. After observing her after her molt, it’s clear that 1 of her back legs is a little wonky, but she is still moving fast and like a normal tarantula, so I think it will fix itself with her next molt. We have made her a bugsmoothie as suggested before releasing and given her her last drink of water.

Today we drove 30 minutes with her to a protected piece of nature to set her free. After she molted it became clear that she is in fact a Hapalotremus hananqheswa species. A dwarf species that are earth dwellers and absolutely only native to this little piece of the Andes in Peru. I’ve been reading up on their habitat and burrows to try and help her out a bit.

We found a great spot and dug her a hole halfway under a larger boulder, put in her favourite “resting” rocks from her ‘rehabilitation habitat-burrow’ in there for her, let her crawl in and covered most of the exit with a stable rock (the one she’s had in her habitat since we found her), and covered that with moss etc, so that it was well hidden and the entrance was the size they are used to in nature.

We dug out a little hole close to the burrow, for a small porcelain bowl, camouflaged it and put rocks in before pouring in water. It will catch rainwater for her going forward. She is also not too far from a natural river (you can hear it in the background).

It’s been an emotional day for us. Especially the kids. It feels so right to let her back into nature and at the same time I’m already thinking of the 10.000 things that could happen to her tonight. But alas, she is free again, and I hope she lives a long and healthy life, free of hawk wasps, and makes lots of babies 🌀

Thank you to everyone who has read along the last 8 months. It’s been overwhelming with the support Bluey (and we) have received, and we thank you endlessly for all your cheers and sharing of knowledge. I am SO RELIEVED that this story is ending happily.

India’s rise in football has begun and here’s how you can add fuel to the momentum on this historic journey.,"India doing well in football has been a quiet dream for millions in this country. But has always remained a dream. 

From being surprised to know that India even has a football team, to dissing the Indian team’s poor performances, to whining about why cricket takes all the limelight, 
the current Indian team despite poor infrastructure, pathetic administration, no media attention, bad attendances etc have now started performing very well climbing up steadily the FIFA rankings of 174 to 148 and now at around 99 or 100. 

We need to sustain this momentum in not just form of the team but also the recent spike in interest and buzz about football and show that there is huge commercial potential and sponsorship viability so that companies and govt bodies start investing massively into Indian football. It is very much possible.

Here are some pointers to ensure we keep up this momentum and see India as a force to be reckoned with in football-

1. *Let go of the cricket vs football pointless argument*- Cricket is a superb sport. It rose to prominence in India after great performances  on the international stage. Cricket does not have to fall for football to rise. India is a huge country with enough population and diversities to field strong teams in many sports. Look at Australia who is great at cricket, rugby, football, tennis, olympics and every other sport. 

2. Talk about Indian football team and its matches on your social media stories and tweets. Don’t be ashamed or think it is beneath you. If you’re an influencer, promote India matches and show how mainstream it is. 

3. Engage with Indian football team content on social media. Follow the pages. The instagram page @IndianFootball is lit and worth following. Many other pages and Youtubers too worth following. Hit like, engage etc to show the numbers. 

4. Watch team India play in stadiums. Sponsors love fully filled grounds and notice it. India’s gameplay and style is much more improved now from the entertainment point of view. The current coach has infused a spirit too that is good to see. No, we are nowhere near Rank1-50 teams but the journey is long and the belief has to be strong. 

5. Watch team India play on TV/OTT and increase viewership numbers. Brands will love to sponsor something that is not as crowded as cricket 

6. There is nothing wrong in being a fan of a European club or supporting powerhouse nations like Argentina, Brazil, Portugal, Spain etc. The quality of football is top notch. I too followed, supported etc for many years and still do (club). But if you’re one who disses our own national team just to look cool and sophisticated , know that none of those clubs or other nations would care if millions like you get wiped out. 

7. Be a part of positive change and be vocal on social media. Ditch being cynical and start asking the right questions to the right authorities. Unlike BCCI which is like a private entity, the others are run by tax payer monies and babus who will get away with lame administration and corruption if fans are submissive and look the other way. Don’t like something? Be a part of the solution. 

8. Understand the models like that of Japan and J-League and how in football grass root level change takes decades to reflect. Our U-17 and U-20 kids are doing great and there is great hope. 

9. Know that football has 200+ nations who take it seriously and it is extremely tough to be in the top 50 if not even the top 100. 

10. Know that the theory of Indians being physically inferior is total crap. Even so countries like Japan and S.Korea do amazingly well. 

11. Buy a India football jersey. The current one has kick ass colours and designs. Btw the likes Nike and Adidas refused to pay sponsorship money for our kits long ago so we ditched them too until a time that they do. They need to see a huge market. Give them one!

12. Follow the ISL (Indian Super League). Gone are the days when India had a dead football league. The ISL is exciting, good quality, well followed and well covered event. 

13. Know about the Indian players. Not just Chhetri. But who is the Goal keeper? Who are the defenders? Who is the next upcoming striker? Discuss the starting XI. 

14.Talk to the kids and the next generation that India playing in the FIFA World Cup is a dream for millions in the country and it maybe them who will end up being heroes for this country. If you have kids or nephews/Nieces- influence them to dream. 

15. Follow the subreddit called IndianFootball. 

16. Criticise, critique, bash the Indian team, slam the tactics by the coaches but…but watch them play and discuss all of it. The good, bad and ugly. 

17. Support local clubs. Your city, town or village. Attend those games.

"[Disney Pins] Much Ado About a Database, Or Who Knew Shiny Pieces of Metal Had This Much Drama?","To begin with, I am only a very casual pin collector and was not in the hobby when all of this went down. I’ve been able to piece this story together from reading way back in several forums that were very active at the time, but if anyone else knows more details (or sees something I’ve gotten wrong) please speak up. First, some backstory about Disney pin collecting and collectors:

Hardcore Disney pin collectors are a relatively small and insular community. Most non-traders tend to think of the Disney pins as enamel pins of characters that one can easily find on a pre-packed lanyard and purchase at one of the many gift shops that dot Disney parks along with the occasional set you can find at Wal-Mart or Target. As a general rule, the pins in this story are not those pins.

To start with, there are three categories of Disney pins:

* “Rack” or open edition pins are produced without regard for edition number and could theoretically be available forever if Disney finds the pin profitable. These are the majority of pins that one can find on any spinning rack at a Disney park or property, along with most of the pins that proliferate at the Disney Store’s website and at other retailers.
* “Limited Release” pins are generally only available at a select location (sometimes only Disney World OR Disneyland), and are generally smaller in terms of edition size, but edition size is often not made public.  Theoretically these pins could be as open-ended in edition size as a rack pin, or they could be incredibly limited. There is at least one infamous Limited Release pin ([Rapunzel from the Reveal/Conceal Girls series](https://www.pintradingdb.com/pin/9)) that is considered one of the lowest-edition and hardest-to-find pins out there.
* “Limited Edition” pins are exactly what they say—a select number are produced, and they generally sell out fairly quickly to both collectors and resellers. While originally many LE pins were available online for Disney fans to purchase from anywhere in the country, these days they are almost all exclusively released at or around the Disney parks.

It’s not uncommon for older rack pins of popular characters to inflate in price on eBay, but it’s a guarantee that LR and LE pins will immediately double, triple, or more in price once they are sold out and eBay becomes the sole place to get your pin fix.

Except, of course, if you trade.

Pin trading became an official Disney “thing” back in 1999, and originally was centered solely in the Disney parks. Today it also takes place online amongst people who don’t live anywhere near a park. Rack pins tend not to trade well with the pin-trading elite, which means that a trader needs LE and LR pins—the lower the edition size and more popular the movie/character the better—as “traders” (i.e. pins they don’t really care about except as currency) to trade for their “grails” or most-wanted pins.

And lest anyone mistake this for an inexpensive hobby, some of these hard-to-find LE and LR pins sell for thousands on eBay. That Reveal/Conceal Rapunzel pin I mentioned a moment ago? There’s one up on eBay as I type this for $8,000.

So once upon a time, two Disney pin fans got the idea to create a database of pins. It would be crowd-sourced, which meant that people could take pictures of their actual pins—not just stock images owned by Disney—and people could use it to both keep track of what was “out there” in the pin-trading world. It was also envisioned as a resource to catalog traders’ own collections and to arrange trades with other pin fans around the world.

Pin Pics was born!

Since Disney doesn’t keep an official public list of all of their pin releases, and because there are hundreds (if not thousands) of new Disney pins released annually, some of which are never available to the general public and are only sold or awarded to Disney employees, it’s easy to see why a database like this would quickly gain popularity. The owners were pin collectors themselves, they welcomed anyone and everyone to add information to the database, and best of all the pin entries could be easily used to track a pin’s popularity; people who wanted to trade for the pin could mark it on their “Wants” list, and people who owned one and were open to trading it could add it to their “Trades.” The ratio between trades/wants became an easy way for collectors to evaluate a pin’s “worth” outside of its original MSRP and whatever someone had most recently sold it for on eBay.

One of the other truly valuable things about PinPics was its use as a “scrapper spotter.” [Scrapper](https://www.themeparkinsider.com/flume/201506/4596/) is a general-use term in the pin-trading community to refer to A: a true production overrun that may also have flaws that led it to being “scrapped” in the factory, B: a bootleg pin made using the original pin molds but not authorized by Disney, or C: a counterfeit that looks approximately like the real pin, but may also have significant differences such as paint color, irregular stamping on the back side of the pin, strange margins, etc… Basically, scrapper = fake pin.  Disney has an unofficial policy to not really care much about scrappers (why is a hotly debated topic amongst pin collectors—from what I have gathered it’s likely a combination of the cost of trying to shut down counterfeit operations in China as well as a desire not to leave a bad impression on tourists who unknowingly buy grab bags of cheap “park tradeable” pins on eBay to trade on vacation at one of Disney’s parks). Cost-wise it’s obviously better for Disney to keep the vacation-only pin traders happy and spending money on park tickets, food, and other merchandise than it is to make them feel bad for having a fake pin, especially when a real version of the same isn’t even a drop in Disney’s vast bucket. But for many collectors, pin trading is the only point of going to the parks, and scrappers aren’t considered valuable or tradeable if you’re a true hobbyist. Scrap versions of many rack, limited release, and limited edition pins all exist.

Scrappers ballooned in the mid-2000s, and PinPics was seen as a good way to track pins that had known or suspected scraper copies in circulation, as well as to verify what the “real” pin was supposed to look like. I cannot stress enough how much the Disney pin community relied on PinPics. Tens of thousands of images were uploaded onto it over the years, virtually all of them pins that its members owned or had owned themselves. The database was not-for-profit, free to access, free to use for trading via a messaging system, free to utilize as a catalog of your own collection, and ultimately free for scrapper identification.

PinPics had its own discussion forum called PinTalk. Another forum called Disney Pin Forum (DPF) came into existence around the same time. From what I have been able to gather they weren’t really competing forums—PinPics was mostly about its database, and DPF had no similar product, it was just a place for people to talk about pins. Both filled a hole left when an older site called Dizpins went offline. Many members participated in both forums under the same usernames, and DPF frequently referred new collectors to PinPics. Most of my links here are from Disney Pin Forum because PinTalk’s archives start in 2013 when the forum moved to TapaTalk. Even the Wayback Machine wasn’t helpful in locating earlier records. Many posts from the current version of the PinTalk forum have also been subsequently deleted, particularly those that related to the drama I’m about to detail. When possible, I’ve included PinTalk links, but there are some pretty large swaths of posts that have clearly been deleted.

At the outset, PinPics explicitly allowed eBay sellers, some of whom were the same people who had uploaded all of those pictures onto PinPics in the first place, to use its images in their listings. This was notably in the early days of eBay when fewer people owned high-resolution digital cameras, and before eBay required sellers to post actual pictures of the items they were selling.

Back in 2012 all of this came crashing down around everyone’s ears.

In a nutshell, the owners of PinPics had tired of the hobby, and as such were no longer interested in maintaining the database. All of those images, all of the traffic, and all of the hotlinking via eBay likely cost quite a lot of money. So [the owners sold the database to a trio of fairly new pin collectors that went by the collective moniker of LANSAM](https://www.disneypinforum.com/threads/pinpics-under-new-managment.11315/).

As new traders (and there were rumors that at least one member of the trio wasn’t a pin collector at all, and was only interested in the potential of making money off PinPics) [LANSAM were viewed with a considerable amount of skepticism](https://www.disneypinforum.com/threads/pinpics-under-new-managment.11315/page-2) from the larger pin trading community from the beginning.

To start with, LANSAM very quickly made it clear that they were interested in turning PinPics profitable. Now, the finances of the original PinPics owners were never transparent—periodically there would be fundraising drives to pay for server costs, but the exact cost of running the site was never disclosed—however LANSAM opened their relationship with the pin-trading community by teasing that they were going to upgrade the OG PinPics system to a new, better, more efficient one that would also offer some additional benefits to those who paid annual subscription fees. What those benefits were remained murky at first, but many pin traders were alarmed that content they had provided for the benefit of the hobby and for their own collections could be monetized. Worse, they were worried that they could be locked out of the images and descriptions they had provided if they didn’t pay ongoing fees to LANSAM.

Shit. Hit. The. Fan.

While many members of the larger community urged calm and noted that LANSAM weren’t likely monsters, that they had been vetted by the original, trusted owners of PinPics and had been found to be worthy buyers of the database, and that the subscriber benefits were supposedly going to be new features that the current PinPics did not offer, a very vocal group continued to run around shouting that the Disney pin sky was falling.

[LANSAM offered to host both a Q&A chat](https://www.disneypinforum.com/threads/q-a-sessions-with-lansam-and-pinpics.12278/) as well as to accept questions via private message that would be answered FAQ-style on the forum as a way to quell the furor. According to people who participated, [the chat did not go well](https://www.disneypinforum.com/threads/q-a-sessions-with-lansam-and-pinpics.12278/page-5). Too many users, too little time given to answering difficult questions about the future of PinPics, and a growing awareness that LANSAM had few concrete ideas about how they would accomplish some of their stated and implied goals for the site were all highlighted in a thread about the chat on DPF. A few of the more skeptically-minded users worried that the FAQ would turn into just a selection of questions that LANSAM wanted to answer, and that since all questions had to be submitted via PM the larger userbase would have no way to know which questions LANSAM was declining to respond to. Nevertheless, the chat happened and the FAQ  were posted.

Until they weren’t.

Days after both went live, [they were unceremoniously removed from the PinPics forum](https://www.disneypinforum.com/threads/q-a-sessions-with-lansam-and-pinpics.12278/page-7). No rationale was given for their removal, but the negative response to both from users who had previously encouraged others to keep an open mind was fairly obviously behind it.

At about the same time, LANSAM changed its user agreement to announce that [PinPics would no longer allow their images to be used on eBay listings](https://www.disneypinforum.com/threads/pinpics-proposes-ebay-photo-use-ban.12415/), and that they were going to watermark every image that had already been uploaded onto the site as well as those users would upload in the future. Now, keep in mind that use in eBay listings had been explicitly allowed up until this point. Many pin collectors were also pin sellers, and (see $8,000 Rapunzel Reveal/Conceal) eBay pin sales can be big business. Few people on the forums would admit to being sellers as well as traders, but some did freely acknowledge that they had eBay storefronts and were upset that images they had uploaded of pins in their own collections were suddenly PinPics’ to watermark and restrict.

[Internet armchair lawyering is never pretty](https://www.disneypinforum.com/threads/pinpics-proposes-ebay-photo-use-ban.12415/page-3), and plenty ensued on this topic. Lots of yelling and shouting, but ultimately very few people were either able or willing to do the work it would take to get their images (which were not apparently tagged with the username of the person who uploaded them) taken down.

Things largely died down between the larger collector community and LANSAM for a few months after this, except for an ongoing beef between a Disney Pin Forum user named TiggerNut and LANSAM. TiggerNut was one of the users most vocally upset about the watermarking/eBay issue, and was quite open about the fact that she had a large eBay store and relied on PinPics images, thousands of which she claimed to have uploaded herself, to sell her merchandise. [She continued to yell and shout regularly on DPF](https://www.disneypinforum.com/threads/pinpics-why-newbies-shouldnat-run-ita.19568/#post-268943) about how much she distrusted LANSAM, but the forum’s users seemed largely tired of the conflict and ready to move on, especially if LANSAM could deliver on a better version of PinPics. [She was eventually blocked from PinPics, as were several others](https://www.disneypinforum.com/threads/lansam-pinpics-banning-more-users-watch-out.14966/). TiggerNut remained convinced until the end that all of those who had been banned were being blamed for poor behavior because they were friends with her, though [others threw doubt on this theory](https://www.disneypinforum.com/threads/lansam-pinpics-banning-more-users-watch-out.14966/page-2).

At some point, TiggerNut encountered LANSAM at a pin trading event, and was very upset that it appeared that they were selling high-end pins. Some recent Googling had [led TiggerNut to believe](https://www.disneypinforum.com/threads/q-a-sessions-with-lansam-and-pinpics.12278/page-4) that one of the members of LANSAM was the relative of a suspected scrapper dealer who had sold faked high-end pins. He also had a felony conviction on his record for passing bad checks. In a since-deleted DPF post, [she posted images of LANSAM at a table during the pin event, displaying pins, and heavily implied that she thought they were A: planning to use the site to set up pin sales in the future, and B: selling scrappers](https://www.disneypinforum.com/threads/pinpics-proposes-ebay-photo-use-ban.12415/page-6).

Now, as you can imagine given the concern over scrappers, reputation is a very important part of pin trading and selling. PinPics and Disney Pin Forum both had a system whereby users could rate one another, similar to the way a buyer can rate an eBay seller (though PinPics’ later went offline and never really came back). Any negative or even neutral feedback—especially regarding knowingly selling scrappers—could tank a trader’s reputation, even if they had hundreds of positive feedback comments and only one or two negative. DPF was very cautious about the potential for libel claims against the site, and disallowed lists of eBay sellers who allegedly sold fakes at the time (a list is now prominently featured on the forum), [and TiggerNut was roundly discouraged](https://www.disneypinforum.com/threads/q-a-sessions-with-lansam-and-pinpics.12278/page-4) from A: making claims against LANSAM she could not back up, and B: making accusations against someone for crimes an alleged relative may have committed.

The next phase in LANSAM’s move to monetize PinPics came with the promised PinPics 2.0 site update. For months people asked what the update would look like, would this, that, or the other feature be available, when they were going to get even a sneak peek at the new design, etc…  Finally the new site premiered, and while first impressions were mostly positive the [overwhelming sentiment turned more sour](https://www.disneypinforum.com/threads/delete-post-plz.41478/) as people began [poking more extensively through the site](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/pintalk/changes-to-the-site-t1078.html) and [realized that some of the features](https://www.disneypinforum.com/threads/delete-post-plz.41478/) they had enjoyed previously were not available.  There was also the problem that [the site wasn’t actually in its final form yet](https://www.disneypinforum.com/threads/delete-post-plz.41478/page-2), and likely hadn’t been ready to debut at all. The fact that PinPics kept its old site still running for months after the supposed changeover did not help matters any; some longtime users simply refused to shift to the new site because using the old site was easier and more comfortable.

Disney Pin Forum and PinPics had not been friendly for some time at this point, with quite a lot of criticism of the new PinPics owners and site happening on DPF, but DPF users clearly still drove a considerable amount of traffic to PinPics on a regular basis, and many of them continued to be regular posters on the PinPics forum. For one thing, PinPics continued to facilitate trades, but more importantly it was where almost all users still kept track of their collections and wants. Need an image of a pin you desperately want but don’t have? PinPics has it—just copy or hotlink to it and you can put it in your DPF signature for other traders to see. The more views on that signature you get, the greater the chances are that you’ll run into someone on the forum who has what you want and will trade it to you for something in your (also linked) PinPics trade list.

In 2013, [PinPics informed the owners of DPF that all links to Pin Pics must be disabled](https://www.disneypinforum.com/threads/delete-post-plz.41478/page-7). Not just hotlinked images, which would be understandable from a cost perspective, but straight links between pages. Overnight, all of the links went dead. [This decision was reversed](https://www.disneypinforum.com/threads/delete-post-plz.41478/page-4), but [then it wasn’t](https://www.disneypinforum.com/threads/delete-post-plz.41478/page-6), and neither site seemed to fess up to being the ones to break the links permanently.

Because neither DPF nor PinPics had informed users about the takedown, [at first people assumed that the broken links were temporary](https://www.disneypinforum.com/threads/pinpics-links.41541/#post-624923). When an announcement was made that it had been deliberate and would be permanent, people began to lose their minds. I am going to be unabashedly editorial here and say that this decision is one of the dumbest things I’ve ever read on the internet. Hotlinking images costs server money without driving traffic to a hosting site, but straight links between the forums isn’t the same thing. Moreover, Disney Pin Forum brought traffic to PinPics (which at this point was selling pins and accepting subscriptions) through those links. It is just so much shooting oneself in the foot to shut down all links because you’re getting some pushback about changes from your own users via a third party. [When tempers cooled over a year later talks about allowing links resumed](https://www.disneypinforum.com/threads/i-am-done-with-disney-pins.56309/page-3), but the damage was permanently done and most links to PinPics within the DPF archives still don’t work.

The next major concern for many regarding LANSAM and PinPics came when the newest PinPics business venture was announced. Unlike many other collectables, Disney pins had never embraced (or had an independent body willing to engage in) rating pins.  Mint vs. near-mint? There wasn’t a real system in place. Seeing a hole in the market, PinPics began offering a pin-grading service. For a fee, a collector could send their high-end pin to PinPics, have it evaluated, and then get it encapsulated with a grading sticker attached to the box verifying its condition. Given how much money certain hard-to-find pins can be worth on the secondary market, this isn’t an unreasonable service, nor is it outside the realm of what many other hobbies (such as baseball card collecting) already do.

The only problem was that LANSAM’s biggest weakness in the community from the beginning was its collective inexperience with Disney pins. [Many reasonable collectors](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/pintalk/from-our-other-site-on-pin-grading-good-or-bad-t53.html) asked for evidence that the person doing the rating had extensive experience with pins in the first place, much less with the very low-edition pins (see again, Reveal/Conceal Rapunzel) that most collectors who’d been in the hobby for years had never seen in person. With so many designs, how could a rater know for sure that a slightly blunted edge on a pin was a defect, not a standard feature on every pin made in that design? What about scrappers? Would the rater be enough of a pin expert to spot well-made fakes? Would he/she be able to tell the difference between an authentic pin with manufacturing defects from a scrapped fake?  [No clear answers were available, only assurances that the grading service was going to be good for the community](https://www.disneypinforum.com/threads/my-sunday.37133/#post-546063).

The grading service launched, and like so many things in this story, some parts went perfectly well and would have quelled controversy had they been announced in a timely manner, and some did not. [Tomart](https://www.hobbydb.com/marketplaces/hdb/subjects/tomart-publications-publisher) was in charge of the grading, which calmed fears about expertise. The graded pins, though, were a different story once they started getting shipped back to their owners. For one thing, the seals that were supposed to assure an owner/buyer/seller exactly what they were trading or selling? [Not the most unique or tamper-resistant looking sticker around](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=400904463392163&set=a.373296249486318). [Some were worse.](https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=373295882819688&set=pcb.373296242819652) The service never seemed to take off, and was quietly discontinued at some point in late 2014 or early 2015.

In late 2013 [the first rumblings](https://www.disneypinforum.com/threads/pin-database-alternative-what-do-you-think.41550/) of a new pin database that would compete with PinPics began. People quickly pointed out that matching PinPics’ catalog would be challenging due to how long it had been around, how many older pins had been added by now-defunct collectors, and how extensively PinPics’ system of numbering pins for identification purposes had penetrated into the collecting community as a whole. This is still true, by the way, a casual search on eBay for “PinPics” nets hundreds of hits as many sellers list the identification number created by PinPics in the title of their listing. Still, there was interest in an alternative database if it offered different features than the current iteration of PinPics while also featuring a deep catalog of pins. [Disney Pin Place was born](https://www.disneypinforum.com/threads/pin-database-alternative-what-do-you-think.41550/page-7)! Less than two months later, it died. As best I can piece together, the site’s architect was scraping data from PinPics, including photos, to build the database quickly. PinPics quickly issued a [DCMA takedown notice](https://www.disneypinforum.com/threads/bandwith-exceeded-at-dpp.43448/page-2). The [2019 read on the situation](https://www.disneypinforum.com/threads/disney-pin-place-id.70427/) comes down squarely in favor of the takedown, but at the time people were quite upset about it.

Remember back when the sale of PinPics to LANSAM was brand new and TiggerNut was ranting that she was convinced that they were going to start selling pins? [Guess what they did](https://www.disneypinforum.com/threads/pinpics-exclusive-pins.41802/)? This venture involved  a distribution agreement with ACME/Hot Art, a company that was licensed to manufacture high-end official Disney pins. [It was a big freakin’ deal](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/pintalk/new-pinpics-le-disney-pins-on-sale-sat-11-23-t118.html), and some of these were big freakin’ pins. [How it worked was that people could pre-order these limited edition pins (costing between $40-$200, and marketed as not just pins, but works of art), pay up front, and then would receive their pins when the manufacturer shipped them from China](https://www.disneypinforum.com/threads/pinopolis-acme-hotart-pin-updates-basically-messages-from-them.64350/page-4). In addition to selling pins outright, there was also a game called [Pinopolis](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/pintalk/acme-pinopolis-pins-t3462.html)—also the name of the PinPics pin-selling company--that is frankly far too confusing for me to try to explain (and I would explain it poorly), but if you’re really interested their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pinopolispins/) has posts as recent as March of this year. Only people who placed pre-orders were initially supposed to be able to acquire these pins, but unsold inventory was sometimes later made available to the general public for not much more than pre-ordering customers paid.

Back in 2018, the Pinopolis/ACME agreement came apart. First, very expensive pins were taking months—6-8 or more—to arrive after pre-orders. Payments made through PayPal have a limited refund shelf life of 180 days. Beyond that, people who had paid hundreds ([or thousand](https://www.disneypinforum.com/threads/pinopolis-acme-hotart-pin-updates-basically-messages-from-them.64350/page-10)s) of dollars for these pins were effectively left without recourse to get their money back, even if Pinopolis never delivered their pins. Second, no one really seemed to know what was going on with the pins, [including the people who worked for LANSAM and Pinopolis](https://www.disneypinforum.com/threads/pinopolis-acme-hotart-pin-updates-basically-messages-from-them.64350/page-9). [At one point there was even a testy standoff between two PinPics/Pinopolis reps](https://www.disneypinforum.com/threads/pinopolis-acme-hotart-pin-updates-basically-messages-from-them.64350/page-6) on Disney Pin Forum about who was allowed to answer which questions. Finally, ACME lost the Disney license, leaving Pinopolis holding the bag on pre-orders that might never be manufactured. Interestingly, many of the 2018 designs have been auctioned off over Facebook Live in the last 9-12 months, so at some point Hot Art/ACME did deliver the goods, though Pinopolis stopped trying to market them on the already-burned forums of both their own PinPics site and Disney Pin Forum.

So where does that leave PinPics today? Well, [it’s not pretty, kids](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/pintalk/annoying-ads-on-pinpics-com-t4605.html). The site became increasingly glitchy and unreliable as the post-sale years passed, and notably went down multiple times [just prior to major pin trading events](https://www.disneypinforum.com/threads/is-pinpics-down.65469/page-3) in 2017 and 2018, which is precisely when many traders needed to use it as a trades/wants record. It was all but unreadable for a period in 2019 when more page space was eaten up by ads than content. I first tried to look at PinPics while this was going on, and it was even worse than the screenshot in that last link shows. Per their own forums, at least as far back as 2018 the database itself was [starting to crumble](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/pintalk/what-have-you-submitted-that-is-not-posted-yet-t4018-s140.html) under the weight of old, buggy code. In spite of accepting [sponsorship donations (with associated ACME pin bonuses](http://pinpics.com/PCWM/faqs.html)) for years, the site struggled to support its servers.

At present, no one appears to be [maintaining the database](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/pintalk/are-new-pins-being-added-to-database-t4909.html) or [uploading new pins](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/pintalk/pinpics-contact-t4934.html#p54753) that have been submitted by users over the last few months. Lenny, part of the LANSAM group, [posted to their forums back in October](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/pintalk/about-a-pesky-rumor-regarding-pinpics-t4809.html) that the database is not for sale, and that they are working on rolling out an even newer update, but it’s been crickets since then. As much of pin trading has moved to Facebook and Instagram it’s unclear just how big a change the slow demise of PinPics is having on the larger Disney pin collector community, but for its core of dedicated longtime users [it’s clearly making an impact](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/pintalk/is-pinpics-fading-t4712.html). [A new pin database](https://www.pintradingdb.com/) has also emerged, one that is generating its content new without using the photos or descriptions that were originally crowdsourced and then copyrighted by PinPics. To date that database has a little over 30,000 pins recorded; PinPics’ database holds nearly 120,000. No matter what happens to the databases in the future, losing PinPics as an active resource almost certainly means losing records of many pins that collectors would like to preserve.",https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/gd06k3/disney_pins_much_ado_about_a_database_or_who_knew/,CoolClearMorning,2020-05-04 04:03:30,1092,HobbyDrama

[Cricket] when a small yellow strip shook Australian cricket,"##Key terms:

All you need to know about cricket for the incident is this: in cricket, a bowler has to bowl (throw) a ball to a batsman, who has to hit it away to score points (runs). Using a certain grip, the bowler can make the ball move in the air (swing) to make it more difficult to play. It will conventionally swing [in the direction the seam of the ball points](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeathrattlePorn/comments/1269fd4/bhuvneshwar_kumar_to_mohammad_hafeez/). BUT, as the ball gets older, one half of the ball can get very roughed up and the ball starts to [swing in the opposite direction](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeathrattlePorn/comments/zzwtr3/zahir_khan_vs_mitchell_johnson/), which is very confusing for the batsman to deal with. When the ball starts doing this, it’s known as [reverse swing](https://imgur.com/a/93ym7rQ). This process can be sped up by wearing one side of the ball down. Using an external substance to wear down the ball is not allowed and **illegal in cricket.** You *cannot* artificially change the state of the ball, i.e. ball tampering.

##An even start to the series

So, Australia arrived in South Africa for a 4 match series in March 2018. Good hype going into it as these are two good sides with some quality players. We’re looking forward to some hard fought matches. Australia win the first game convincingly and, going through the highlights, we can see some clear examples of reverse swing helping Australia out. Nobody suspects anything though: ‘it’s probably just helpful conditions naturally wearing the ball down’, everyone thought. South Africa bounce back in the second match, thanks in part to brilliant batting from AB de Villiers. 1-1

[“This series will be one to remember""](https://twitter.com/abdevilliers17/status/970527354090065920?s=46&t=zY2eXHwCMjF-B524yXU6yw) \- ABD was more right than he could've known

There has already been some controversy with over-aggressive behaviour at this point in the series. Kagiso Rabada, South Africa’s young fast bowler, has been in the news for being over the top when he gets batters out, and [received a ban for 2 matches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SM-XMaLcxTw), which he was able to overturn.  David Warner, the Australia vice captain, appeared to [be having a go at a South African player](https://youtu.be/09kGJZZLlEg), Quinton de Kock. Shout out to Faf du Plessis, South African captain, for the absolute alpha energy of walking in wearing only a towel and breaking up the fight. Apparently de Kock was frustrated by Warner insulting his family members, and made [a derogatory comment about Warner’s wife](https://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/australia/reports-candice-slur-triggered-david-warners-midtunnel-rampage/news-story/c1f345a23f58ea5bd4fb8c6acac8be3a), pissing him off. Clearly some hostility from both sides in this series.

##Caught in 4K

Into the third game now, South Africa look in a good spot to be able to take the series lead 2-1. Australia aren’t out of it yet, but they will have to play really well to win the game from here. Then, the camera crew pick something up. They focus on Cameron Bancroft. [What’s that in your pocket, Cameron?](https://imgur.com/a/qotD90v). The incredulous “aww maate, Jesus!” in the background pretty much says it all. It’s how we all felt seeing that clip for the first time. A suspicious yellow substance is visible in his hands, clear for everyone to see on the big screen. The umpires come up and have a chat, but nothing happens immediately. Bancroft shows them a black sunglasses cover and play continues. The fans [discuss the incident online](https://reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/86stgl/what_did_bancroft_just_shove_down_his_pants/), the commentators discuss on air: it looks an awful lot like Australia are up to no good. But nobody wants to make public accusations before anything has been confirmed. Australia cancel all media interviews and delay the press conference, probably so they can carefully consider their response. But what could they say to clear this up? The video evidence looks pretty damning.

Michael Clarke, former Australia captain: [“Please tell me this is a bad dream”](https://twitter.com/MClarke23/status/977609413610545152?lang=en)

##A shambles of a press conference

[Bancroft said](https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/cameron-bancroft-steven-smith-admit-to-ball-tampering-1141516) “I saw an opportunity to use some tape, get some granules from the rough patches on the wickets and change the condition, it didn't work, the umpires didn't change the ball. I was sighted on the screen and that resulted in me shoving it down my trousers” A strange decision to bring some conspicuous sticky tape in your pocket, when there are much [more effective, documented ways](https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/seven-ball-tampering-confessions-from-the-past-1141992) of going about it. Fans immediately suspect that the substance is [actually sandpaper.](https://reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/86x1yv/_/dw8gtze/?context=1)  Maybe the Aussies are trying to make it seem better by lying about the method. But there isn’t any evidence, at least not yet. The captain Steve Smith, interestingly, stressed that the coaches weren’t involved and it was purely “the leadership group” who planned this. At the same time, footage had surfaced of the coach Darren Lehmann, seemingly [talking into a walkie-talkie covered with his hand](https://imgur.com/a/sj8QY7J). Hmmm. Was he in on it, contrary to the captain’s statement? What Steve Smith also seemed to suggest is that this is the first time they planned anything like this, as they [only decided on it during the lunch break](https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/desperation-drove-australia-to-cheat-steven-smith-1141521). Again, people aren’t convinced of this: their bowling was fine the last couple of games and in their previous series against England, what necessitated such a sudden change of strategy? Finally, Steve Smith confirmed that he will *not* step down as captain: “It won’t happen ever again under my leadership”. Essentially, nobody fully trusts anything said at this press conference. Everyone agrees that Smith [has horribly misread how bad the situation is. ](https://reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/8733yg/_/dw9ud3x/?context=1).

##A sad day to be Australian

It is said that the captain of the cricket team has the second most important job in Australia. So for something like this to happen? Unthinkable. Due to the time difference between South Africa and Australia, this is all going down while most Australians are asleep. So when they wake up to this news the following morning, they are not happy.

>If CA [Cricket Australia] does not sack #SteveSmith and his ‘Leadership Group’ immediately they will do a great disservice to both the Sport and the Nation



>Absolutely embarrassing by the Aussies. Smith should stand down as our captain. Sad day to be an Aussie today.



>	Fly them home in economy. Revoke all privileges. Extraordinarily angry at these blokes.



>[The worst thing any of us have seen on a cricket field](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/86x1yv/comment/dw8h7tf/?context=1)

The Australian government then publicly requests Cricket Australia (CA) to remove Steve Smith as captain. The Prime Minister himself, Malcolm Turnbull, even commented on the incident: “a shocking disappointment”. Oh shit.  Steve Smith and David Warner are swiftly removed from their roles. Meanwhile the international governing body of cricket, [the ICC, hands out punishments](https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/steven-smith-banned-for-one-test-bancroft-given-three-demerit-points-1141593): 3 demerit points for Cameron Bancroft, and Steve Smith is banned for 1 match. Many think a[“one match ban does not do it justice”,](https://twitter.com/GrahamC41/status/978001612697370625?s=20) that they need to be taught a lesson.

The sponsors were also worried now. They [demanded an explanation from CA](https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/a-shameful-moment-for-australian-sport-cricket-sponsors-hit-out-20180326-p4z6a8.html) and for them to take actions to protect the reputation of the sport. Magellan would later [cancel their sponsorship worth AU$20 million](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-29/asics-terminates-deals-with-david-warner-and-cameron-bancroft/9600470). 

South Africa crush Australia in the third match, with the soon to retire Morne Morkel putting in a performance. But the attention has shifted away a bit from the match now. What’s going to happen with Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft?

##CA cracks down

CA would investigate and decide that the three players were in breach of the Code of Conduct (“bringing the game into disrepute”). It was also confirmed that it *wasn’t* tape, but *sandpaper*  which had been used to alter the ball. So the tape was a lie. And all that jazz about the coach, Lehmann, being involved? The investigation found that he used the radio to ask, essentially, [“what the f\*\*\* is going on?""](https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/daniel-brettig-the-six-words-that-put-darren-lehmann-in-the-clear-1141889). He was cleared. In the end, Warner was found to be the instigator, Smith did nothing to stop it, and Bancroft carried it out. Warner and Smith both received 12 month suspensions, Bancroft got 9. A possibly devastating blow to their careers, with no opportunity to play international or domestic level cricket for a whole year, it was also made clear that these players would [not be considered for any leadership positions anytime soon](https://web.archive.org/web/20190504091206/https://www.cricketaustralia.com.au/media/media-releases/cricket-australia-statement-update/2018-03-28).

The next day, Smith gives [a tearful press conference](https://youtu.be/HQBytgYVn0o) apologising for his mistakes. Bancroft [does the same](https://youtu.be/kfyaryBWWws), and Warner [followed suit a few days later](https://youtu.be/Dv2uCOtlWYs), because he wanted to “take a deep breath and spend time with his family” before making any statements.  [Darren Lehman then steps down as coach](https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/steven-smith-s-tears-force-darren-lehmann-to-step-down-as-australia-coach-1141969), mentioning Smith and Bancroft’s public apologies, but also asserting a major part is wanting to spend more time with his family. 

##Polite Inquiries

People continued to question whether this was genuinely the first incident of the team planning to tamper with the ball. English player Stuart Broad openly challenged the notion this really was the first time: [“it's surprising why they'd change a method that's been working”](https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/stuart-broad-pours-scorn-on-australian-double-standards-1141615), and this was a sentiment many shared. Mitchell Starc’s key bowling in the first match had been reliant on reverse swing, and there was now a shadow of doubt over everything: the Australians may have been unfairly changing the condition of the ball much longer than anyone knew. Footage surfaced of Bancroft [shoving sugar in his pocket](https://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/australia/does-he-have-form-cameron-bancroft-caught-allegedly-pocketing-sugar-during-ashes/news-story/8e3607e7676550b5b4867e60dde2b1ac) during a match vs England. It might be related, might not, but the loss of trust in Australian cricket certainly made us more inclined to believe the worst.

Some people ask [“what’s the big deal?”](https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/why-is-australia-so-outraged-at-steven-smith-s-team-1141734). We’ve had ball tampering before: Shahid Afridi decided to [literally bite the ball](https://youtu.be/IjIDhTDq0fU) and his only punishment was a ban for a couple of matches . Hell, even the South African captain du Plessis has been [pulled up on ball tampering charges before](https://www.cricket.com.au/news/faf-du-plessis-lolly-mint-ball-tampering-icc-punishment-adelaide-test-australia/2016-11-22).  Prominent former cricketers were split on the matter. Some thought that CA’s punishment was [too harsh, spurred by public opinion.](https://www.news.com.au/sport/cricket/some-in-cricket-finally-prepared-to-fight-for-smith-bancroft-and-warner/news-story/a87898f526ef9de74378b9c8d477bdfa)

Others thought it sent a good message that this is unacceptable and will not be tolerated. Ball tampering happens, sure, but this one is different. Premeditated cheating and pressuring a rookie to help you out and ruin his career? That’s not on. That's unAustralian. Australian cricket has often had a culture of playing hard and fair, aggression without cheating, [à la Viral Kilo](https://www.reddit.com/r/CricketCopyPastas/comments/a6394p/viral_kilo/). But it now seemed to have reached a breaking point: the Aussies had now blatantly cheated.

It’s also been theorised that more of the team knew than has been let on. Though the bowlers denied any prior knowledge, it is a little strange that they didn’t notice a change in the condition of the ball. You’d think the bowlers would pick up on a ball becoming more worn down than expected. Some former cricketers have suggested that [there’s no way only 3 people knew about the plan](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-28/the-cricket-world-reacts-to-australians-getting-sent-home/9595664): it doesn't make sense that others were left out in these discussions. In a team structure, players always check with the rest before doing anything with the ball. And Bancroft alluded to it in [a 2021 interview](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/may/14/cameron-bancroft-on-the-australia-cricket-ball-tampering-scandal-i-lost-control-of-my-values):

>So some of the bowlers did know?  
>	
>Bancroft’s hesitation is even longer. “Uh … yeah, look, I think, yeah, I think it’s pretty probably self-explanatory.”

A ranking of the test teams but it's based solely on the quality of their sweaters,"Not Classified:

**-Afghanistan**

Try as I might I’ve seen neither hide nor hair of Afghanistan’s test jumper. I’m not sure they even have one. If anyone knows please enlighten me.

&#x200B;

**-Bangladesh**

Verdict: Believe it or not, the gentleman in [this image](https://imgur.com/a/t4rVb0B) is technically wearing a jumper. A glorified extra layer of shirt, it is an abomination. Do better Bangladesh, do better.

*0/10*

How to improve: [It all started out so well](https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2021/11/bangladesh-test-debut.jpg). Everyone sometimes can do with going back to their roots. Stop it. Get some help. Get a cable-knit.

&#x200B;

**-Zimbabwe**

Verdict: [Here](https://imgur.com/a/C85y9eK) we see Milton Shumba depart after charging down the pitch, being bowled for 7, and hastening an innings defeat for his team. That pretty much sums up the ‘jumper’ he’s wearing too.

In a way this effort is a microcosm of Zimbabwean test cricket. Seldom seen, not pretty to behold, and I just want it to get better.

*0/10*

How to improve:

Just like the nation itself, the history of Zimbabwean sweaters is turbulent. I have a soft spot for the [aggressive black and red](https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_w_960,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/242200/242283.jpg) chonky bois of the [late 90s](https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_w_960,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/40600/40635.jpg). But for classic style, the [double piping in deep green version](https://www.alamy.com/cricket-zimbabwe-practice-the-riverside-4603-heath-streak-and-douglas-hondo-zimbabwe-mandatory-credit-action-images-lee-smith-image404259006.html) is unbeatable. Especially since it stretches all the way back to Zimbabwe’s [pre-test era](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4ffc9c3124cf5597ad1f2ef6758059d3).

&#x200B;

**-Sri Lanka**

Oh my dear Sri Lanka. How hast thou [fallen so far](https://imgur.com/a/HHtUaSm). Once a nation of great quality in the [bowling and clothing department](https://media.gettyimages.com/id/585025634/photo/only-test-match-england-v-sri-lanka.jpg?s=2048x2048&w=gi&k=20&c=5jblBOQdVd6M4UADFGmehwhJ67AuW1JUlrsZb-O2aDk=). Now they find themselves like Bangladesh in a [sorry state of affairs](https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_w_1280,q_80/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/355800/355830.jpg).

How to improve:

In 1988 Sri Lanka came to Lord’s looking [like this](https://media.gettyimages.com/id/136351836/photo/sri-lanka-cricket-team.jpg?s=2048x2048&w=gi&k=20&c=jKxDYzWOuTuRc2dXPYMxHmL5fi5WP74PpN5_LtpuEck=). The central emblem. The simple double colour bars. The cream tone. Can’t be beat. Get on it SLC.

&#x200B;

**-England**

Verdict: England come off the back of a long period of [dreadful entries](https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article7105421.ece/ALTERNATES/s1227b/kpout.jpg), but their [recent effort](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/06/09/20/29418806-0-image-a-6_1591730531972.jpg) was nice. Then last summer a new kit supplier came and [ruined everything](https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_w_960,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/342100/342170.jpg). Not a proper cable knit, [horrible bright white](https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_w_960,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/341900/341982.jpg), and a weird blue accent around the neck and hem. Castore, I shall be sure to never give you my custom.

*4/10*

How to improve: Make it a proper cable-knit, and make it the right colour. It’s also always seemed a shame that England don’t add a little flair to their jumpers with piping. The Yellow, Red and Black of the [MCC touring jumpers](https://e0.365dm.com/21/03/768x432/skysports-joey-benjamin-cricket_5298907.jpg?20210309180749) from back in the day could and definitely should make a return. Perhaps on the next Ashes tour we can borrow some of [South Australia’s exquisite efforts?](https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/daedc5c8c33ff85067a69121d072d60b)

&#x200B;

**-West Indies**

The West Indies’ current effort is [rather strange](https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_w_960,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/349400/349420.jpg). The piping in particular is narrow, and the shade of green within it is too light. Piping around the shoulders on the pullover version is also a [frankly bizarre decision](https://resources.pulse.icc-cricket.com/ICC/photo/2022/11/29/ebd875d1-cc8c-4ff1-aec1-b1ad5f6fc1d6/Tagenarine-Chanderpaul.png) that does not look at all right. The full sweater version [does look far better](https://www.cricket.com.au/~/media/News/2020/07/03WindiesTestSweaters.ashx?la=en&hash=E4D1AC50769DB75052089AF4F3BFEB3F14B0EE1D), though. The colour and cables are perfectly nice.

*6/10*

How to improve: Many West Indies fans would give anything to have the likes of Curtly Ambrose and Brian Lara back. The same extends to the [sort of jumpers they used to wear](https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/sport-cricket-first-test-match-headingley-leeds-8th11th-june-1995-picture-id79024754?s=2048x2048).

&#x200B;

**-New Zealand**

There’s a lot to like about [New Zealand’s sweater](https://c.ndtvimg.com/2020-12/h4t6cdjo_new-zealand-test-afp-_625x300_14_December_20.jpg). It’s a [proper cable knit](https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_w_1200/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/355000/355043.jpg), it has no big ugly sponsor logos, and nice piping.

However, there’s a certain panache a test cricket uniform should have this sweater is missing.

*7/10*

How to improve: [Re-introducing a third black bar](https://static.toiimg.com/photo/2697912.cms?imgsize=22312) would make all the difference. Somewhere in those few centimetres of black fabric lies the joie de vivre that the current Kiwi effort lacks.

&#x200B;

**-South Africa**

Verdict: SA like many others fell victim to a period of [utter horrors](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Graemesmith.jpg) but their current effort is a [quaint little number](https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2021/12/quinton-de-kock-ap-1600-16409328964x3.jpg). Plus points must go to the [pleasingly central Proteas emblem and lack of sponsorship](https://cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/ZQYTXMZVLH3FMAJ3RNNPOA3RLM.jpg), as well as nice cream colour and robust looking cables. However, the incredibly slight piping in bright shades inexorably make the wearer look like a freshly wrapped subway sandwich. Remove them and you’d get something close to [this](https://www.sacricketmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Gerhardus-Liebenberg.jpg) perfectly acceptable past effort. Still, overall I rather like it.

*7/10*

How to improve: Combine the elements of the current and [other recent](https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/nintchdbpict000335276228.jpg?w=670) sweaters to [get this](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/33/8c/5c/338c5c30325b32c32efd0ecdd0c2d404.jpg). Simple.

&#x200B;

**-India**

India rocked up to the first ever WTC final wearing their [first decent jumper](https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-84429292,width-1200,height-900,resizemode-4/.jpg) for years, and happily [seem to have kept it](https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-85822392,width-1200,height-900,resizemode-4/.jpg). It does a lot of things right, but it perhaps a tad messy what [with all the sponsorship](https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/P2GQOBGSDVMNJJAN5NJS3S3GOM.jpg). However it’s aging nicely, yellowing to look [really rather good](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6bd154fd3d44ca0cbda9f529fa7213e27ca2da9/0_39_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=1200&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&s=8df4d19f91bb96efc4621534e6d11b5c).

*8/10*

How to improve: back in the day the navy piping was [accompanied by sky blue and yellow too](https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/indian-batsman-saurav-ganguly-celebrates-his-century-during-the-3rd-picture-id110569318?s=2048x2048), and it made for one of the [best looking sweaters](https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/indias-sachin-tendulkar-salutes-the-crowd-after-scoring-a-century-on-picture-id51531257?s=2048x2048) there’s been. Add those to elevate the current design. Don’t recognise [this young batsman](https://p.imgci.com/db/PICTURES/CMS/94800/94829.jpg), but he and his teammates look the business.

&#x200B;

**-Australia**

It pains me to say it as an Englishman, but Australia’s jumper game has been consistently [brilliant](https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_w_960,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/349700/349726.jpg). Good colour, nice wool and cables, a crest in the centre, and good piping. An [excellent accompaniment](https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_w_960,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/350500/350543.jpg) to the classic and iconic baggy green. [Top work sandpaper cunts](https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/350600/350686.jpg).

*9/10*

How to improve: Perhaps the removal of the sponsorship logo, but it’s certainly not a big thing.

&#x200B;

\-**Pakistan**

[A top tier entry](https://imgur.com/a/vTbMtW3). Basically the same comments I have to say about Australia’s effort, except the overall finish of Pakistan’s [comes away slightly nicer](https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2022/12/pakistan-vs-england-1st-test-live-score-16699461544x3.jpg) for reasons that I can’t quite put my finger on.

*9/10*

How to improve: Improvements have already been made in recent years – most hilariously after \[\]( [Wasim Akram railed against](https://sport360.com/article/cricket/cricket_pakistan/281385/pakistan-board-to-investigate-test-jumper-mystery-in-dublin) the inexplicable omission of Pakistan’s iconic green and yellow piping. Again, like Australia, less sponsors would be nice, but commercial realities must be considered.

&#x200B;

\-**Ireland**

Verdict: [Sublime](https://i2-prod.irishmirror.ie/sport/article12518416.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200c/inpho_01371331.jpg). The off white colour is perfect. The cables are the right size (no nonsense chunky), and the simple deep green of the piping and cricket Ireland logo [look elegant and convey the identity of the emerald isle perfectly](https://resources.pulse.icc-cricket.com/ICC/photo/2018/08/13/b39cb87d-5745-48e9-890b-aef34d68cc8f/Ireland.jpg). The new boys have turned up and handed it to the old guard emphatically. [This is what it looks like](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c672e5742f70bf5d756e1a2b998c4a8a4adad6d1/0_112_3608_2165/master/3608.jpg?width=1200&height=1200&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&s=285ec287bcf57308cf133b4103985ae0) when you appreciate the history and dignity of test cricket. Everyone else should take note. Pity we don’t get to see it in action more often.

Matthew Renshaw goes into graphic detail about Pune Test toilet break incident,"“It sort of came on really quickly,” Renshaw said. 

“I let one rip out there in the middle, we were about 15 minutes away from lunch

“And then about five minutes later I am standing there a bit more uncomfortable (and think) ‘is this another fart or is this something a bit more serious?’ And then it sort of started coming on very quickly and I asked ‘how long till lunch?’ and he (Kettleborough) was ‘like 15 minutes.’

“I was trying to think 15 minutes, that’s about four overs and all of a sudden I really needed to go to the toilet and I sort of asked him ‘how long till lunch?’ and he said ‘13 minutes why are you asking me again?’”

“The 12th’s come on and I am like ‘I need to go to the toilet,” he said.

“I am going to shit myself on the field or just get to a toilet, so I've asked the umpire if I could retire hurt, go to the toilet and come back at some point later, because I didn’t know what was going on.

“If I was going to have to retire out I’d have to stay there and have a lot more nicknames than just the guy that ran off the field

“He said I could retire hurt, so I have just bolted and Smithy (Steve Smith) is on his way out to bat and is already confused about why I am running and he is like ‘no come back with me’.

“So I am holding this in and have walked back to the umpire and confirmed with Smithy about what is going on.

“I go into the dressing room and from the dressing room to the toilet it has gone onto tiles and I have forgotten I have spikes on — I am ripping my pads off, have gone onto all fours and just got to the toilet.”

For that effort Renshaw copped a lot of flak from many including former Australia skipper Allan Border, who felt the opener should have toughed it out.

Surprisingly now, having played his most recent Test in March 2018, against South Africa, Renshaw agrees.

“I think part of me is still really annoyed at myself that I didn’t take a shit in my pants on the field.

“If I shit myself on the international cricket stage I feel like there could have been more sponsorship opportunities.”

"Why is it DaBaby can kill someone, catch multiple gun charges, assault people, but homophobic comments got him canceled?",I’m not defending DaBaby’s comments by any means. He was wrong. But why is it he can or other rappers rap about shooting other black men and it’s crickets? You can call woman  offensive comments and it’s quiet? DaBaby had sponsorships and made songs about violence and caught charges after charges. And no one dropped him. I just think it’s hypocritical. It’s alright if you rap about killing black men but don’t dare say anything homophobic. I think it kinda shows you what’s acceptable in society.

A message of thanks from the Icelandic Cricket Association,"At the start of our 2018 summer season, r/Cricket raised approximately $3000 to sponsor Iceland Cricket for two years. The understanding was that none of this money would be used to subsidise expenses that would otherwise have been borne by the adult players themselves. 

Here is what your funding achieved:

* A new kit for all Iceland players, bearing the specially-designed r/Cricket logo and a “Grow the Game” motif designed by r/Cricket. Replica jerseys were delivered around the world. 
* The hire of a professional ECB-qualified cricket coach who created a Junior Coaching Qualification course and delivered it to nine coaches. 
* Our nine qualified junior coaches then devised a junior coaching programme, taught in Icelandic, to be delivered free to children all around Iceland.
* The coaching programme was first delivered when our coaches were invited by the   
 Sporting Association of Iceland to give a demonstration of cricket at their expo.
* Schools in three Icelandic towns (Hafnarfjörður, Vík and Hveragerði) engaged our coaches to deliver the coaching programme, for free, to a total of 130 children.
* We then appointed an Assistant Coach (Junior) from our junior coaching team, and he devised and delivered an ‘in-house’ junior coaching programme at our indoor facility.
* Sponsorship of a new six-a-side tournament, held on a single day in midsummer 2018 and 2019, called the r/Cricket Arctic Sixes, featuring five teams in 2018 and four in 2019.
* Sponsorship of our annual indoor competition, held from January to April in 2019 and 2020, which was renamed from the Domestic Cup to the r/Cricket Volcanic Ashes.

Before r/Cricket got involved, we had 312 Twitter followers. We had not played international cricket, we had no junior cricket at all, and we had no sponsorship income from overseas. 

As the two-year sponsorship period comes to an end today, we have 19372 Twitter followers. We have played five international matches, we have brought cricket to over 150 children in Iceland, and we have generated massive interest in Icelandic cricket overseas.

We’re kind of at a crossroads now. People look at us less as the plucky cricketing underdog of Europe these days, because we’re no longer the smallest, weakest European cricketing nation. We’re maybe third or fourth from the bottom, now. But we feel like we’ve gone out of fashion! So we hope that someone, some day, will come forward and consider us worthy of further support. 

We made you a video to say thank you (see below).

Best wishes to you all

Covid-19 update Wednesday 6th May,"**\*tap tap…\*** Is this thing on?

Good afternoon from the UK.  It’s Wednesday 6th May.  Sorry about yesterday; my company is coming into peak and I’m having to be creative with my supply chain to avoid the extremely high airfreight prices that I’m being quoted; it ended up being a 18 hour day yesterday.

In case you didn’t yet get the memo that a brutal recession is under way (many say it will be the worst in decades), here’s a canary in the coal mine example; rents are starting to drop sharply in Australian cities with some parts of Sydney seeing drops of as much as 15% ([link](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/29/renters-bail-out-and-sales-plummet-as-coronavirus-hits-property-market)).  The same thing is happening in US cities [says the USA Today](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2020/05/04/coronavirus-rents-falling-recovery-near/111640312/), London is also getting affected [says the Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/uk/london-house-prices-could-hit-hard-coronavirus-demand-country/).

Professional sport leagues are getting affected too.  An [article I found in The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/05/british-sport-devastating-700m-black-hole-covid-19-pandemic) says that the English Football League, the Rugby Football Union and the England and Wales Cricket Board are looking at a combined loss of £700m next year ($865m US / €801m).  At the other end of the scale, six unnamed British Olympic and Paralympic sport teams are facing a threat to their solvency within the next three months because they are unable to host events and membership fees and sponsorship have dried up.  The chairman of the English Football League, Rick Parry, painted a similarly bleak picture when he spoke to MPs, telling them the 71 lower league clubs were facing a £200m black hole by September.  Parry said it was impossible to predict how many clubs could go under but was adamant English football would have to undergo huge changes, including a salary cap for players, to sustain itself in the years ahead.  “In the Championship wages are 106% of turnover,” he said. “That is ridiculous and it is definitely not sustainable now or in the future. One benefit of going through this pain is that we will be shocked into a more sustainable model.”  [ESPN has picked up the theme](https://www.espn.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/29110487/sudden-vanishing-sports-due-coronavirus-cost-least-12-billion-analysis-says) from an American perspective; it says that the sudden disappearance of sports will erase at least $12 billion in revenue and hundreds of thousands of jobs, an economic catastrophe that will more than double if the college football and NFL schedules are wiped out this fall by the coronavirus pandemic, an analysis conducted for ESPN shows.  The meltdown is a fraction of the crisis spreading across the country, but it is nonetheless historic, touching every sector of the $100 billion United States sports industry, it says.

# Supply chain news in depth

&#x200B;

**Seven US states have teamed up to buy $5B of medical equipment to fight coronavirus -** Multiple sources [including supplychaindive.com](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/7-states-form-regional-supply-chain-to-buy-5b-in-medical-equipment-to-figh/577298/) are reporting that tensions have swirled between President Donald Trump and embattled states that have called on the federal government to take the lead with the national COVID-19 response.  The states have asked the administration to centralize procurement through the Federal Emergency Management Agency and get it to take ownership of sourcing and distribution.  Trump has instead “taken a backseat approach”, says supplychaindive, putting the onus on states as governors report losing equipment negotiations to FEMA which can pay higher prices.  Add in competition from private companies as well and some equipment is soaring in value (for example the price tag of a single ventilator has snowballed from $12,000 to $65,000, according to the comptroller of Illinois).  The result: Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island are aiming to use their combined purchasing power to drive down prices for the in-demand supplies for their combined 53.6 million residents. The group will also coordinate planning on gradually lifting social distancing requirements as the number of confirmed U.S. deaths from the novel coronavirus passed 67,000 on Sunday.

(Cont’d) The new regional supply chain is an attempt to tamp down on those skyrocketing prices as demand is unlikely to let up anytime soon, with some public health experts forecasting a return of the coronavirus in the fall.  ""When you put all those hospitals together, all that public health capacity together — which will make us more competitive in the international marketplace — I believe it will save taxpayers money,"" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a press conference Sunday.  ""I also believe it will help us actually get the equipment because we have trouble still getting the equipment and just buying the equipment because these vendors on the other side they're are dealing with countries, they're dealing with the federal government —why should they do business with one state when they can do business with an entire country?""  The partnership will be especially beneficial to the smaller states involved in the partnership, but all of the states involved should benefit from the increased purchasing power.  ""We're much stronger together, I wouldn't mind having some of that New York purchasing power, thanks for sharing that with Connecticut going forward,""Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont said during the press conference.  In a related move, New York state is now requiring hospitals ot have a 90-day supply of PPE and other key medical supplies at a ""rate of use during the worst of this crisis"" to ensure enough masks and equipment in event of a resurgence, Governor Andrew Cuomo said.

**The coffee supply chain industry is getting affected by Covid-19 too -**  Perfectdailygrind.com has an article [here](https://perfectdailygrind.com/2020/04/covid-19-what-coffee-farmers-want-you-to-know/) explaining that with a lot of people on lockdown, many coffee shops, restaurants and other coffee dispensing locations are closed which in turn means that the roasters supplying them are having to significantly slow down their buying.   Karl Wienhold, Director of the Colombian Farmers’ Collective and Exporter Cedro Alto, reveals that some roasters don’t want to be stuck with stale stock if sales are down; if they over-purchase coffee now, it could result in them getting stuck with old crops - it can be hard to sell green coffee that’s been in storage even for only 4-5 months. It means that many are reducing purchase commitments to decrease their risk and plan to buy more should they need it later.  The problem is rolling back up the supply chain; if the roasters reduce their purchasing activity the importers who’d usually supply these roasters could be stuck with stock they can’t sell so they in turn will reduce purchasing. This will put their coffee exporters under financial pressure, as importers and roasters will be reducing or delaying their purchasing commitments or purchasing and reserving less coffee altogether.  For smaller exporters, this can be a huge blow. Without prompt payments and adequate cash flow, financing even one container can be too expensive, regardless of whether they’re exporting to an importer or roaster. When exporters can’t purchase their usual amounts of coffee or are left in a financial lurch, the producers they work with will be affected. If many producers can’t sell their crops to those who’d usually buy them, they’ll no longer have a market for their coffee.

(Cont’d) Many producers and traders are dealing with their coffees being stuck at the country’s port, unable to move due to closed borders and other restrictions being imposed regarding trade between countries. Additional delays could lead to the coffee ageing, and as Rafael mentions, if a ship or container is detained at port, it will incur penalties, with the incoterms determining who’s responsible for paying these penalties.  Green coffee importer Ally Coffee’s COO Ricardo Pereira revealed that they’re currently focusing on helping producers who have coffee that’s processed, dry milled, and ready to be shipped get their coffee out of origin as soon as possible.  It’s something that all parties involved need to consider, as it will impact exporters, importers, shipping companies, and those who work on these ships. Rafael mentions that “Both importers and exporters have to do their due diligence and investigate… route options for their containers. Shipping companies have to be a lot more careful about their workers; there are several ships that have been detained due to the crew testing positive for the virus.”

(Cont’d) Some producers are finding that they aren’t able to sell their coffee, as their usual buyers are delaying payments or cancelling commitments. Daniel explains that this could mean that “the farmer will have to sell their coffee to a co-operative for a lower market price. The reduction in demand that is expected for the second and third quarters will also have an effect on the quantity of coffee being purchased at specialty coffee prices.”

According to Karl Wienhold, Director of the Colombian Farmers’ Collective and Exporter Cedro Alto, some micro lot quality coffee might need to be sold at regional prices if there’s no demand for it, and that the premiums usually paid for high-end specialty coffee could suffer. This may mean lower prices and less demand for natural and honey processed coffees as well as low-yielding varieties. A struggle to sell these lots while they’re fresh and worthy of a price premium might result in lower prices later on – when and if the coffee gets sold.  Another side effect of roasters reducing their costs is that some might cut back on their social responsibility and sustainability projects involving producers and their farms. With no clear end in sight for COVID-19, this could only resume next year.

It’s a lengthy article and also touches on foreign exchange rate exposure risks, difficulty in crossing borders for migrant workers, that some coffee farms may be forced into taking on very expensive loans and it discusses payments being delayed resulting in cash flow issues for the recipient.  The producers and pickers are taking the worst of it right now, says the article, but everyone needs to play their part in helping the coffee supply chain come out of this with as little damage as possible.

* Cummins struggles with supply chain visibility - Supplychaindive [has an article ](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/cummins-visibility-mexico-supply-chain-concerns/577173/)on the difficulties the engine and power generation manufacturer has faced during the pandemic outbreak.  Its CEO Tom Linebarger clarified that it had its Chinese factories back up and running in full by the end of Q1 (*which I think was no mean feat*) but details are hard to come by on what suppliers are shutting down, why suppliers are shutting down and what suppliers are doing to keep their workers safe during a pandemic.  ""We have a broad and big supply base and we don't know all the things about it I wish I knew,"" Cummins COO Tony Satterthwaite said.  Cummins has been able to find alternative suppliers and sources, which it has been doing since production in China shut down at the end of January, Satterthwaite said, adding that he's been told multiple times ""we're a week out from running out \[of inventory\] and then all of a sudden a week later, we found some way to fix the problem.""  (*Personally I think that’s a startling admission of failure and yet another reminder of why you should map your supply chain - not just your tier one providers but tier two and preferably tier three suppliers too.  They clearly need to invest more in their supply chain capabilities and get a better grip on the risk exposure they face and consider what steps to mitigate it.  This company is admitting its flying by the seat of its pants on a wing and a prayer though this crisis and I’d love to know how much extra it’s having to spend to keep its supply chains up and running...)*

* Xi fears Japan-led manufacturing exodus from China - The Nikkei Asian review [has an interesting article](https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/China-up-close/Xi-fears-Japan-led-manufacturing-exodus-from-China) on Chinese fears that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has proposed building an economy that is less dependent on one country, China, so that the nation can better avoid supply chain disruptions.  That’s worried China; Japan is their third largest customer after the US and Hong Kong.  Of particular concern is the recent financial stimulus announced by Prime Minister Abe on April 7th to incentivise companies to relocate out of China - the equivalent of $2.2bn USD.  They don’t even have to relocate back home to Japan; Abe’s happy for them to spread out around ASEAN countries ([*link to what ASEAN is for the unfamiliar*](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-asean)*).*   For Abe, simply having a China + 1 approach isn’t good enough any more but the issue for China is that Trump also wants countries to pull out of China, preferably to the US, failing that to a friendly nation ([reports Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-china/trump-administration-pushing-to-rip-global-supply-chains-from-china-officials-idUSKBN22G0BZ)).  If the U.S. and Japan, the world's biggest and third-biggest economies respectively, move away from China, it will have a huge impact on the world's second-biggest economy.

* Long Island’s NewsDay magazine has a [report](https://www.newsday.com/news/health/coronavirus/coronavirus-illegal-drug-prices-1.44310209) that illegal drug prices have soared in New York and Long Island due to supply chain disruptions having impacts on illegal manufacturing too.  Marijuana has doubled from $800 to $1,600 from March 2019 to March 2020 per pound, the price of cocaine has gone from a low of $28,000 a kilogram to as much as $34,000, heroin has risen from approximately $50,000 to $56,000 per kilogram; and the price of methamphetamine has gone from $12,000 to $15,000 per kilogram.  Those figures are from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, which according to Newsday has a long-held policy of making street buys to monitor illegal drug prices.

* A program created by Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner has airlifted millions of gloves, masks and other coveted coronavirus supplies into the U.S. from overseas -- but it isn’t clear who’s getting them and at what price, or how much private-sector partners are earning through the arrangement [says Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-01/trump-hails-kushner-s-airlift-but-details-of-sales-are-secret).  Kushner’s “Project Airbridge” provides transportation via FedEx Corp. and others for supplies that medical distributors, including McKesson Corp. and Cardinal Health Inc., buy from overseas manufacturers, mainly in China. Once a supplier’s goods arrive in the U.S., the companies must sell half the order in government-designated hotspots. They sell the rest as they see fit.  The U.S. government provides the air transportation for free, to speed the arrival of the products. The six distributors keep the profits, if any.  FEMA says the effort has slashed shipping time to two days, from the 30 to 40 days that a conventional sea shipment would normally take (*that’s because air freight is faster than sea freight).*  The White House declined to provide any information on prices charged by the distributors, nor did it offer any accounting of the products brought into the U.S. or their final destination -- even for the half of the products designated for areas the government considers hotspots.

* John Deere (maker of agricultural machinery) has announced it will temporarily suspend production at its Davenport Works and Dubuque Works facilities for two weeks. The temporary suspension, which will begin May 11, is due to supply chain disruptions and weakened demand for construction and forestry equipment amid the coronavirus pandemic. Production is expected to resume May 26.   “Temporary production shutdowns such as this occur regularly on an annual basis at our facilities,” says Jen Hartmann, director, strategic public relations at Deere & Company. “This is a common measure to adjust for supply and demand adjustments as referenced above.”  Earlier this week, 159 employees at the Dubuque Works facility were informed they would be laid off indefinitely beginning June 1. These layoffs are in addition to the 105 employees who were notified in February they would be laid off effective April 6, which has since been moved to May 4.

* Talking of food, remember the potato mountain problems that the Dutch, Belgians, Canadians have - all those potatoes and no restaurants open that can fry them?  Add the American farmers to that list, [reports the LA Times](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-05-03/what-do-you-do-with-a-billion-taters-and-the-folks-who-grow-them); they’ve got 453 thousand tonnes (*you read that right, 453,000 tonnes*). The coronavirus pandemic has left Washington’s farmers with at least a billion pounds of potatoes they can’t sell, a new crop growing without any buyers and millions of dollars in debt they have no way to pay.  The state’s fertile Columbia Basin produces nearly a quarter of the potatoes grown in the United States, 10 billion pounds in 2019. The vast majority — 90% — were turned into frozen French fries and shipped to restaurants, some in the United States but mostly to Asia.  “We’re afraid there’s still going to be potatoes in storage when we go to dig up this year’s crop in September,” (farmer) Wollman said. “These are good potatoes. We don’t want to throw them away. It’s just, what do you do with them?”  As it turns out, getting rid of a billion pounds of spuds isn’t easy — or cheap. It usually takes Washington farmers a year to sell that quantity to grocery stores.  “Now we’re trying to move it in a couple months,” Chris Voigt, executive director of the Washington State Potato Commission said.  That means each of the 2 million citizens expected to use the state’s food banks this year would have to take 500 pounds.  And moving all those potatoes would require filling at least 20,000 tractor-trailers — and paying for fuel.

(Cont’d) The Washington potato farmers hope the U.S. Department of Agriculture will step in and buy their billion-pound glut, then donate the potatoes to food banks or even cattle ranchers as supplemental livestock feed.  Local congresswoman Kim Schrier (*Democrat)* said she couldn’t answer whether that was likely.  “I think we have to expand that question to whether the USDA will buy up all the tomatoes or apples or carrots farmers can’t sell around the country, because they’re all hurting,” she said.  “Just in Washington state, we grow other things too, like apples and cherries. We’re afraid a third of our farms could go out of business. It’s a heartbreaking situation.“  The article goes into detail about a 33 year old farmer who is about to default on a $500,000 loan through no fault of his own and is at risk of losing his family farm and also discusses decisions that some farmers are making to try and reduce the size of the financial calamity facing them.

China Southern’s freighters are flying 15.5 hours a day, a rate enviable even for passenger aircraft. Freighters at Air China, China Airlines and Korean Air have also surpassed their annual record. Airlines with cargo aircraft have a rare source of revenue and cash flow as passenger flights dwindle and refunds outstrip new bookings. Air cargo sustained some Asian airlines during SARS, and may do so again during this coronavirus downturn.  Forbes explains that belly cargo (carried in the bottom of passenger airlines) makes up at least half of the world’s air cargo. Korean Air carries over 60% of its cargo in the bellies of passenger flights, while for Singapore Airlines it is 75%.  Stopping passenger flights during the coronavirus outbreak has removed this cargo capacity.  China alone has lost the equivalent of 50 daily 747 flights.  The utilization gains airlines are achieving this month add up. The extra 45 minutes of flying for a China Southern freighter theoretically allows the airline another Guangzhou-Frankfurt roundtrip every 2.5 days. With its improvements, Korean Air can fly an extra Seoul-Singapore roundtrip every day. Air China can make 12 Shanghai-Los Angeles returns in a month with its same fleet.

The West Indies is a collection of island nations that play together in one team. How would you guys feel about a combined European team?,"I hope you will indulge me by allowing something a little left field to be put up for discussion here. I was just thinking about from where our next test playing nations could come from and if there was anywhere that might be able to step up in the near-medium term future and really challenge some of the exisiting powers of the game. Obviously nations like Ireland and Afghanistan have recently taken the step up with full test status; and while having some decent results are long term projects.

I'm aware that there are vast differences in the size of somewhere like Europe which has 400-500m people vs the West Indies with a population of 5+ million; but I feel the model of the West Indies where various nations come together as one could also work in Europe. Some places in Europe such as The Netherlands have already built a niche but healthy grassroot cricket culture; and while it's super fun to watch them compete in the ocassional world cup, I can't help but feel that they are in a similar place atm to where they were when I was watching Tim de Leede, Baz Zuiderant and Joroen Smits run around for them in the 2003 WC in South Africa! For these non-former-british-colony parts of the world where cricket is not traditionally played I feel we need to think a little alternatively to grow the game and allow access to the top echelons of the international game. A couple of things I think which could help this idea along:


- **There has already been various forms of ""European Cricket Championship"" played regularly since 1996.** This shows that despite the lack of professional pathways, sponsorship, facilities or huge amounts of ICC support that these nations have been able to collaborate and through the hard work of volunteers and amatuer players create these international tournaments fueled by their love of the sport. These competitions are already divided into tiers with promotion and relegation; and with a little tinkering could become a decent first class system in the future, with fully professional first class status games happening in the top division; and amatuer cricket (but still a fantastic opportunity for players/identification of talent and a pathway to the top based on merit or performance) in the lower tiers. I think this provides a nice opportunity for players to first represent their countries at First Class level (& hopefully one day the Olympics) and then Europe as a whole hopefully not just at World Cups but as part of regular cricket calender and eventually test cricket. The EU also already shares some centralised laws, open borders, freedom of movement etc. which might help with some of the beauracracy that such an ambitious project may face.


- **It would speed up the professionalism of the sport in the region.** The lack of facilities in many of these countries is both the biggest challenge and biggest opportunity. In the current go-it-alone model I feel like cricket will forever be limited to the most basic, compromised facilities and remain an extremely niche sport played by ex-pats in the park or informal competitions. A little central direction and funding could see each of the cricket associations create their own training facilities, turf ovals and then hopefully a dedicated small cricket stadium to host matches. 


- **The distances are small and travel options are easy and affordable.** If you've ever lived or travelled in Europe you would know that despite it's overepresentation of size on most world maps, Europe is the size of a postage stamp in comparison to other cricket nations. A flight from Madrid to Berlin is faster than flying Melbourne to Perth or Delhi to Kochi; and you could easily take a bus or train from Amsterdam to major cities in Belgium, France, Germany, Denmark and Sweden in anything from a couple of hours to half a day.


- **It would take advantage of recent migration trends from cricketing nations.** Over the past decase there has been a swell in migrants call Europe home especially from South Asia (& to a lesser extent Australia, England etc.) who bring great cricket IQ and passion for the game that without better organised formally structured leagues from grassroots to representing your country largely gets lost upon arrival. Why shouldn't these migrants or their children aim to play in world cups or test matches at Lords or the MCG? Lets face it, this is going to be more likely in a European team than for Germany. I actually played a couple of random games in Hungary when I live there in 2010 and while the passion for the game wasn't lacking, we were playing on a rolled out mat on a football field (to call it a sporting wicket would be a great understatement!). Many of the players did come from India, Pakistan, Australia and England but there were more and more curious Hungarians joining the league which was awesome to see. 


- **There would be plenty of existing players in current first class systems around the world who would qualify through ancestry and help cover any lack in depth in ""homegrown"" talent.** Obviously the dream is to have a team full of homegrown talent who have come through the pathways; however you could no doubt put together a really competitive side already from uncapped professionals with a European parent or grandparent if you combed through the first class systems of Australia, NZ, South Africa and England. In the case of First Class or even First Grade cricketers from Australia, NZ or South Africa the alternate seasons means they could play in both their ""home"" nations and play their off seasons in the Europe.


So there is my case for a combined European international team, what are your thoughts? Think it has some merit or is it the stupidest idea ever? Personally I find that cricket is a sport that can get stuck in its traditions; and other sports have found more succesful strategies in growing their sports outside of their traditional homelands, maybe it's time for cricket to think outside the box a little bit more (beyond T20/T10 leagues). How cool would it be to one day see a Danish, French partnership opening the batting, ably stewarded by their Dutch captain; with a couple of big quicks from Germany and Belgium aided by a wiley Italian spinner? Wouldn't it be great to follow your team on a test tour through Amsterdam, Berlin, Copenhagen and Rome? Maybe one day!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/m2l4dq/the_west_indies_is_a_collection_of_island_nations/,dashauskat,2021-03-11 13:01:07,397,Cricket
I've been working on a Cricket Manager game for the last 7 years,"[Wicket Cricket Manager](https://playwicketcricket.com/) has been my passion project since 2016 and I figured it was time to finally share it with this community :-) The game is available on both the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playt20manager&referrer=utm_source%3Dreddit%26utm_medium%3Daa) (it has been for a while!) and for pre-order on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/wicket-cricket-manager/id1608850803).

This is a cricket management game, similar to Football Manager, where you take charge of every aspect of your cricket club - from finances to signing players and sponsorships, to upgrading your stadium and training facilities. The game starts you off in the lowest division of your preferred league with the goal of winning matches and getting promoted to the top division. Along the way, you'll get detailed statistics, a chance to reminisce about retired club legends, and take part in regular daily and weekend tournaments etc.

Anyhow, I'm always looking for ways to make the game better and have a list of ideas on the [roadmap](https://playwicketcricket.com/roadmap). I'd love any feedback if you're willing to try it out!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/10b6e4d/ive_been_working_on_a_cricket_manager_game_for/,playwicketcricket,2023-01-14 02:40:11,396,Cricket

++**Four years previously.**++

Everybody loved a home side win, except for the tourists. Amir didn’t feel like a tourist, but Pakistani people supported the Pakistani cricket team, even if - like him - they had been born in Birmingham, had never left England, spoke English more fluently than their supposed “native” language, with an accent that was as British as tea and wet weather.

“Amir!”

His best friend Muhammad and the rest of his friends had started heading in a different direction while Amir was zoned out. “You coming?” he asked.

Amir knew what the answer would be, but he had to ask anyway. It was how things worked. “Where?”

“For a drink! Come on bruv, we may as well have SOME fun tonight.”

Amir shook his head. “You know that’s *haram*.” he said. It was their one constant conflict that Muhammad was only a Muslim when it was convenient. The rest of the time, he was just another nineteen-year-old, high on life and not interested in the consequences.

“We’re all sinners, bruv.” Muhammad told him, amicably.

Amir turned away “I’ll see you tomorrow.” he called over his shoulder.

At least there were no catcalls or anything. They respected his faith that much, even if they didn’t respect it enough to practice it properly themselves. He just wished that his best friend wouldn’t use “we’re all sinners” as an excuse. It may have been true, but that didn’t mean he had to exploit it. That just didn’t feel like Islam.

He didn’t preach though. He was no *Imam*, he didn’t know how to be. All he had was his job delivering takeaway food, a council flat, and his religion. It was enough, most days.

He knew from experience that the bus stops near the Edgbaston cricket ground would always be heaving after a one-day game. He didn’t mind the walk: it was mid-July, and even the famously inclement British weather had decided to produce a warm night. So, anonymous and alone with his thoughts, he weaved through streets of Friday-night partiers, just another brown face in a crowd that ran the full gamut of human shades, hunched and with his fingers fidgeting with the edge of his pockets.

He was so shrouded in melancholy that he didn’t even see the person he walked into, but they felt solid as a rock. Knowing full well that a Pakistani face in this day and age could get into serious trouble with a surly drunk, he stepped back a pace, and got halfway through his “sorry mate” when he realised that the other man wasn’t moving. In fact, he still had his back turned.

Nobody else was moving either. *Nothing* else was moving. Traffic stood as still as scenery in the street. The pavement was solid-packed with warm, clothed, human statues, penning him in - he couldn’t even shove them aside to weave through the crowd. He stared at a young woman - she was in the middle of flicking her hair aside to answer her phone, and it stood out impossibly parallel to the ground. Even the light had a strange quality - he swore it took his shadow a brief instant to react when he moved.

And then that shadow became much better-defined as the night-time street orange was flooded out by whiteness. He looked up, and it filled his vision.

One man looked around in confusion, rubbed his back, and returned to his conversation. The streets didn’t even notice that Amir Bahmani was gone.

Kirk was a rich being - a Councillor of the Domain earned a handy sum of money from their position, not to mention the royalties from his biographical accounts, political sponsorships and some shrewd investments. Nevertheless, between buying his ultra-fast ship and then having it fast-tracked through a refit drydock at a corporate freeport where the owners were happy to sign an anonymity contract for an appropriate fee… well. His accounts were looking rather less healthy than they had done in some time.

They would, however, bounce back. He was a client of one of the best investment brokers in the business, after all. And the refits had been worth it. The little life-support blister with its bed, ablutions cubicle and control console had been dismounted from the hull, and behind it had been installed a somewhat larger and more luxurious living suite. Below that, a workshop loaded with the latest in nanofactories and CAD/CAM tools, a dense and comprehensive automated laboratory that could double as a sickbay.

And behind that, the enormous generator and the sealed unit that was the Corti blackbox drive. Mass made no difference to a Corti drive - any ship, any size, any tonnage, the only thing that mattered was how much energy you could force down that little box’s throat, and the behemothic bulk of the fusion reactor that made up by far the largest part of the ship’s size and mass was rated to power city districts. 

There was one last addition: an excursion chamber, equipped with all the gear he could need to remain safe on practically any planet up to and including a Class 12. And it was necessary - the first destination on his list was a Class 10, an unclaimed world (after all, who in their right minds would want to claim a death world?) with the uninspiring designation “Main Yellow 2.55467-1.00209-0.1413-57.88811-3 Terrestrial Temperate 10” - literally nothing more than the type and location of the planet and of the star it orbited.

He slept most of the journey out. The downside he was discovering to his ship was that, having as it did a stupefying turn of speed, the trip times were barely long enough for him to complete the in-flight checklist and get some rest. By the time his alarm woke him he was already within the last hundred or so interstellar units of final approach. There had barely been time for his neural implants to convert the slow-access digital data on his destination into working organic memory.

But, they had. He knew everything that it was practical and useful for him *to* know about that world, barring any gaps in the data, which was how he handled its unique upper-atmospheric turbulence with practiced ease despite having never previously landed without guidance from the ground.

It helped that his target co-ordinates were experiencing a clear day, and as hoped he found a thermal contact within only a short distance of the information that had been in Vakno’s file. Best to land a little way from it, he thought.

He did so. Landing a ship that was effectively a couple of small rooms tacked onto a highly oblate spheroid was a challenge in its own right under MY210573TT10’s gravity, which was nearly 20% higher than the galactic standard norm. Not as high as Earth’s, but enough to be uncomfortable once he stepped outside of the ship’s generated gravity field. Once landed, he performed those few post-flight checks that any good pilot concerned themselves with, and then retreated to the excursion room. 

It took only moments to select the appropriate harness and don it. The device had its own onboard gravity generator that would mitigate the local field, and the rest was a biofiltration force field that should keep anything nasty from coming into contact with him. 

Time to meet the first human he had seen in the flesh for three years.

Jim Clark - The best driver Formula 1 has ever seen (/r/formula1 Off Season History Project),"So, before we start, I have a confession to make. When I started following Formula 1 in 1982, at the ripe age of 5, my dad gave me a magazine he had bought when he discovered that mum was pregnant again. He already had a daughter (aka my older sister) and he was sure it would be a boy. So he bought an F1 magazine previewing the 1976 season (I would be born in September - New Year’s Eve was great for my mum and dad apparently...). 

When I started watching the races with him, he gave me the magazine. I immediately treated it as if it was Gutenberg's Bible. I would flip the pages carefully, marvelling at this incredibly long track map from Germany (isn’t it amazing that even to a 5-year-old, the Nürburgring immediately stood out?), I would look at the pictures of the drivers and my dad would read me the text. And there were two stories that always stood out (I'm sure dad made sure to tell them with extra enthusiasm, but I never asked him and now it's impossible to): the profiles of Juan Manuel Fangio and Jim Clark. I would look at their pictures, Fangio in his Mercedes, helmet and goggles on, taking a left-hand turn, and [Clark](https://imgur.com/Ns8LK2M), in his racing suit, no helmet, his forehead frowned, looking to his left intensely, I would ask dad to read it again, I memorised the whole magazine until he bought me the 1984 season review book (and then I memorised that). [I’m sorry I’m linking to different pictures, but there’s no way I’m risking my 1976 magazine in a scanner, it’s too precious, and phone pictures of it look terrible]

But Fangio and Clark remained. I tried so hard to find out more about them, although it wasn't easy (no internet, obviously). Even as I cheered for [Nelson Piquet](https://imgur.com/QMDX1je) during the [1983 season](https://imgur.com/VQabd1d) like a mad young boy, I couldn't forget those two. And I cannot, to this day, choose which is better. Some days, I think it's Fangio, some days, I'd say it's Clark (just a hint, today is a Clark day). 

For a boy that never had any idols, never had any heroes (I'm annoying), those two were the closest thing I ever had. And that's why it's such a pleasure to write about them, because they are the reason why I love motor racing, they are the reason why I think there is nothing more beautiful than a motor race, they are the reason why I try to instil the same love on my kids (and on any kid that I'm left with, really; my nephew is becoming a car nut already, to my sister’s dismay). I'm going to Scotland next year and of course I'm visiting Duns and I've already told the wife that I'm going to cry like a retard when I enter his museum. There will be no way to hold back all that emotion.

So excuse me if I made Fangio's life seem heroic and otherworldly, because I'm about to do the same with Jim Clark, the quiet farmer boy from Scotland who was the most naturally gifted driver we have ever seen.

Let's dive in.

* * *

Born in Kilmany, Scotland in 1936, Clark was raised on a farm near Duns, close to the border with England along with 4 sisters. After a few years, he was sent to the Loretto School in Edinburgh to finish his education, his main sporting interests being cricket and hockey. 

When he was 16, however, his uncle and grandfather both passed away and he was forced to return home. Now, Clark had no dreams of being a racing driver at this point. He knew that it was expected of him, having only sisters, to take over the family business and raise sheep (the family had 2 sheep farms, about 12.000 acres in total).

One day, going to a Young Farmers meeting (Young Farmers is an organisation in Scotland that serves as a social centre for each region, hosting all sorts of activities for the local youth – their ethos is to offer personal development for young people, but I imagine it’s more of an “it’s the only place you can meet girls around” type thing), Clark overtook another car on his way there. The driver of the overtaken car, Ian Scott-Watson, thought Clark was an idiot for driving as if he was a racing driver and, upon arriving at the Young Farmers meeting, sought out the driver to tell him off. They became best friends in little time and Scott-Watson would be the man responsible for changing Clark’s life completely...

Scott-Watson was doing local racing events in a Sunbeam-Talbot and invited his new best friend to join him. Clark accepted and started tagging along as a mechanic. One time, after Scott-Watson finished his practice for the race the next day, Clark went out to see what driving on a track felt like. And in 5 laps, he was 3 seconds faster than Scott-Watson, who couldn’t believe what he was witnessing. When he got out of the car, Clark asked his friend (who maintains that he was dead serious when he said it) why everyone was going so slowly. His friend, who still could not believe what he had just seen, explained to Clark that the others were not going slow, he was just going so bloody fast... It really did seem that Clark’s ability to drive was simply something he was born with, a natural talent.

**Racing driver**

The next day, June 16, 1956, Clark started his first ever race. But it wasn’t a smooth transition. Scott-Watson remembers that it took all the effort by him and other friends who were there to convince Clark to take part, as would be the case a few more times, for he was ever reluctant to believe his own talent.

In 2 years, he was driving for a local team, racing Jaguars and Porsches in national events. In 1958, he won 18 races...

On Boxing Day, that same year, he would meet the man who would take him to Formula 1. There was a GT race at Brands Hatch and Clark would finish the race in second place to a driver named Colin Chapman. During the next decade, those two names would dominate Formula 1 in a manner never seen before (and not seen since until a certain German went to drive for the Maranello squad).

In 1959, Clark joined John Whitmore in [Lotus Elite Mk. 14](https://imgur.com/JJKZfvz) at Le Mans, finishing 10th overall. The winner that day was the Aston Martin driven by Roy Salvadori and Carroll Shelby. Graham Hill, who would be Clark’s teammate later, did not finish the race, driving a Lotus, while Colin Chapman withdrew before the race started, having to simply watch. And watch he did... When Clark won the Bo’ness Hill Climb soon thereafter, Chapman was sufficiently impressed to give Clark a ride in his Formula Junior team.

**1960**

Early in 1960, as winter was ending, Clark’s father talked to his son and told him that either his racing hobby would pay for itself or he would have to give it up. Little did he know what was in store for his only son.

Soon after his father ultimatum, Clark took the Lotus Formula Junior around Goodwood (a stand-alone event and Lord Goodwood’s estate) and won the race, beating Lotus driver John Surtees in the process. That was enough for Chapman. 

As Surtees left the Lotus Formula 1 team to go compete in the Isle of Man TT, Chapman took Clark to the Dutch GP at Zandvoort as the team’s third driver, behind Innes Ireland (who was also beaten by Clark in the 1959 24 Heures du Mans) and Alan Stacey. Ireland would finish second, behind the Cooper-Climax of Jack Brabham, Stacey would retire on lap 57 and Clark on lap 42 (both retirements caused by transmission failures).

The following weekend, as Surtees was still not back, Clark again took the start at the 1960 Belgian Grand Prix, the worst weekend in Formula 1 history until San Marino in 1994. For the 1960 race, Formula 1 still used the long Spa track, 14.12 kms of dangerous high-speed racing, with the fearsome Masta kink still in place. It would prove disastrous.

In practice, Stirling Moss suffered an accident that would take months to recover. Mike Taylor also crashed in practice, suffering injuries that would end his racing career. Once the race started, however, things would get worse. Chris Bristow crashed at Malmedy, hit an embankment, was thrown from the car into barbed wire, being decapitated by it. Alan Stacey, Clark’s teammate, was then hit in the face by a bird at the Masta Kink, crashing going full throttle and dying instantly. Clark, in an interview in 1964, would say about the Belgian GP: “I was scared stiff for the whole race, I was afraid to let the car slide and drift, a terrible race.” Even if he was, he still finished fifth, scoring his first points in Formula 1. For the rest of his career, Clark would hate going to Spa, but it didn’t stop him from winning the Belgian GP four times.

With Stacey’s death, Clark went on to drive the rest of the 1960 season, finishing fifth again at the French GP and scoring his first podium at the Portuguese GP. His mechanic for those early Lotus years, Cedric Seltzer, remembers that, upon meeting Clark, he thought that there was no way that this was a racing driver, since he was so quiet, so shy. But his opinion changed completely once Clark was in the car, Seltzer saying that the transformation was incredible, it was as if he was a different person.

One of Clark’s sisters, Betty, upon going to see her brother racing in Formula 1 for the first time at Brands Hatch (Clark would finish P16), was appalled at the danger and couldn’t bear to tell her mother, once she was back, what she had seen. Mrs. Clark, once she saw with her own eyes, started to simply wish for the races to be over, so she could breathe again. But they knew that there was no way they could pry Jim away from this world now.

Clark still had time to go to Le Mans again, this time finishing third along with Roy Salvadori, driving an Aston Martin.

**1961**

In 1961, Lotus and all the other F1 teams would be powerless against Ferrari. It was the first year of the 1.5 litre formula and the Maranello team proved unbeatable, with Phil Hill taking the drivers title and Ferrari the constructors. But Clark still managed to set the fastest lap at Zandvoort and two podiums (Dutch and French GP). 

During the Italian GP, however, things would again turn grim. Wolfgang von Tripps, who came in as the only real opponent to his teammate Phil Hill in the driver's championship, was battling with Clark down the back straight when, approaching the Parabolica, he overtook Clark, hit the brakes and pulled into the racing line, their wheels touching. Clark was sent into the barriers, retiring immediately. Von Tripps, however, would crash into a crowded spectator stand and be thrown from the car, killing 15 people and the German driver. Italian police immediately blamed Clark for the accident, which would cause a lot of troubles for Clark for a few years to come.

Surtees, who was following Clark and von Tripps has always sustained it was a racing incident, albeit with horrendous consequences. But it left Clark in a terrible mental state. Lotus personnel were all worried about him since they could see how shaken the accident left him.

Clark retreated to Scotland and spent the winter there, being hounded by the media (which seriously displeased the reclusive Scot). He was terribly afraid he wouldn’t be able to go back to Monza without the police wanting to arrest him.

**1962**

As the 1962 season started, Lotus debuted their new car, the [Lotus 25](https://imgur.com/CWGyayU). It would revolutionise the sport. The car had a chassis that was three times stronger than the 24, but lighter by 50% (Brabham had purchased 24s to race that year and were not pleased...). The drivers would race almost lying down, improving aero efficiency tremendously. Powering the 25 would be a Climax V8. After the Italian domination of 1961, this season would be a British party (with Porsche scoring their sole GP victory with Dan Gurney at Rouen as the only non-British win).

The 25 would be a revolution in design but a disaster in reliability. Clark would retire from 4 of the 9 races that year, most of them from the lead, including at the last race, in South Africa, where remarkably he could still have won the championship. Clark would end the year in second place, behind Graham Hill (BRM), scoring 6 pole positions, 5 fastest laps and 3 race wins (including his first ever, at Spa ironically).

But the season started at Zandvoort, where Clark had trouble from the start, eventually finishing P9. First race niggles on the 25 prevented it from showing its true pace. Before they could travel to Monaco, where the 25 would show its qualities, Clark and Lotus took a trip across the Atlantic to compete in the Indy 500 (covered brilliantly by /u/waluigithewalrus [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/7gk1vh/formula_1s_relation_with_the_indianapolis_500_in/).

The local talent was impressed by the Scot. Parnelli Jones said, “he seemed to be a natural”. Andy Granatelli said (a few years later) “he was an incredible racing driver, he showed up the way that day. (...) He was perfection when it came to being a gentleman, never lost his cool with anything”. 

And Clark would need to not lose his cool, since he should have won the race if the organisers had made good on their promise to DQ any driver that was leaking oil. Parnelli, the race winner, earned the nickname “Parnoily” that day, for he drove the later part of the race with a cracked oil system.

Back in Europe, Clark took the 25 to Monaco and promptly got pole, did the fastest lap and retired with a clutch problem. It would be a recurring theme in the 62 season...

But at Spa, no one could deny Clark. Hill got pole, but Clark did the fastest lap (almost 2 seconds faster than Hill’s pole time) and would not be denied in his least favourite track, winning with over 40 seconds to spare to Hill. It was victory at last for Clark and the Lotus 25, the first of 4 in a row at the Belgian track.

Clark, after winning his first race, changed absolutely nothing. He continued to be as reclusive as ever, media-shy to the extreme, and preferring to be left alone. The events in Italy had actually made it worse, for he was terrified of having the subject brought up again and again during the season, trying his best to say the least amount possible at every weekend.

In the French GP, Clark snatched pole, lead at the start and was forced to retire with suspension damage, Gurney taking the win. Back in British soil, Clark got pole, fastest lap, and won the race (not the last time he would do so). It was a triumphant victory for Lotus, with Clark leading all 75 laps at Aintree.

The Lotus 25 was not a good match for the Nürburgring, though, and Clark could only manage P4 that day, Hill taking another win. It would be much more at home at Monza (where the race was now held on the shorter track, the longer version with the banked turns being dropped after the previous year’s tragedy), but the 25 unreliability was again at work, and Clark retired with gearbox troubles. But, to his relief, no one tried to arrest him (he was hauled for questioning again, which greatly irritated Clark, as he obviously didn’t have a better recollection of the accident one year later).

Next up, the USA GP at Watkins Glen. For the third year in a row, Ferrari didn’t send a car over to the USA race, leaving Phil Hill without a ride for his home GP yet again and the British to dominate unopposed. But Lotus did send their cars and Clark made good use of it. Again he dominated. Pole position, fastest lap, lead 93 of 100 laps, race win. He lost the lead while lapping backmarkers, but promptly lowered the lap record to below his pole time, overtook Hill, and never again lost the lead, lapping the whole field other than Hill, who finished second, with Clark actually easing off after 70 laps (after setting another lap record before being told to slow down), as the team was afraid they would not see the checkered flag if he kept going on that pace.

So as the F1 circus travelled to South Africa, Hill and Clark were in a fierce battle for the driver's championship and the last race would decide it. Clark was 9 points behind, but a race win would give him the title (the scoring methods were weird), so he promptly put the 25 on pole, determined to win the race. At the start, he got away clean from Hill and was comfortably in the lead until lap 62 (out of 82), when an oil leak forced him to retire. Hill was left to take the win and the title.

Later, being interview on British TV, he was asked about Clark, to which he answered: “He’s a very tough opponent. He can drive quickly and he can race, which are not the same thing.” Then the host asks him, as the interview is being aired live, if he would like to say something to Clark. Hill, answering with no hesitation, looks at the camera and says “I hope you go back to farming.”

**1963**

As 1963 started, Lotus was sure that nothing would stand in their way this year. The 25 had been thoroughly tested and its reliability improved. Clark was as good as ever and after retiring at Monaco with a gearbox failure, he went on to win the next four races. Again at Spa, then Zandvoort, Reims, and Silverstone. Surtees won at the Nürburgring before Clark won at Monza, Mexico, and South Africa again (Hill won at Watkins Glen). 

His seven wins set a record that would only be equalled by Alain Prost in 1984 driving the McLaren MP4/2 and beaten only in 1988 with Ayrton Senna and the McLaren MP4/4. But considering 1963 had only 10 races and both 1984 and 1988 had 16, Clark’s 70% win ratio is much better than either McLaren driver.

Clark also got 7 pole positions and set the fastest lap in 6 of the races. It was a simply dominant year for Lotus and Clark. His fastest laps were usually track records, he won at Spa with almost 5 minutes to second place Bruce McLaren (under torrential rain, no less), lapped the entire field at Zandvoort, lapped everyone other than second and third places at Silverstone, it was a superlative year.

He also became the first driver to win the championship with three races to go, being crowned at Monza (where he lapped everyone but Richie Ginther’s BRM), before ending the year by lapping everyone other than Gurney at the South African GP, finishing with 54 points to Hill’s 29. If the scoring system had not only counted the 6 best results, Clark would finish with 73 points (Hill’s total would not change), so he would have more than doubled the second place finisher’s total. A truly incredible demolition of the field. 

Back in Scotland, Clark was welcomed home to much fanfare, with seemingly the whole Scottish Borderlands showing up to cheer on their champion. His old pal Scott-Watson filmed the whole celebration and it is plain to see that, back in his home, surrounded by his people, Clark was jubilant. Smiling, playing, laughing with everyone. 

But it was a very different picture within Clark. His championship celebration at Monza had been interrupted by the Italian police (more questioning) and he was very upset at the British media for the way the reported on it, focusing more on the problems than on the triumphs. An interview from that time shows Clark very agitated when the subject turns to the press treatment of him, going so far as to swear many times. 

For someone that was celebrated by everyone as a very cool-headed and tranquil person, it was very much out of character to hear him like that... John Whitmore, by now a friend of Clark, recalls that Clark would never show emotion, but in those days they started to come out, in the form of outbursts at the press.

A winter in Scotland, however, allowed the press to forget and Clark to relax, travelling to London constantly to stay abreast of the developments at Lotus. He would stay with the Whitmores in their London home, along with another Scottish driver who was starting to get noticed, Jackie Stewart. The Whitmore’s home became known as the Scottish Embassy and while Whitmore and Stewart were there with their wives, Clark was living a very entertaining lifestyle (Helen Stewart once asking Clark if the girl he was with was the same one from the previous week – it wasn’t...).

During this period, Clark met Sally Stokes and they began a relationship that would last until the early days of 1968. An interesting coincidence is that their first date was going to the premiere of Cleopatra, with Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, who would later steal James Hunt’s wife from him. 

During this time, Clark began to show his chronic indecision when outside the car. Stewart recalls that they missed many movies by simply not being able to decide which one to see until it was too late. It became a running joke that Clark could never be allowed to be the one to decide anything.

**1964**

Lotus intended to continue to press the competition in the new season, as the 25 was still unmatched by anything the opposition threw at them. 

But the season would not go to their plans. Ferrari brought a new and improved challenger and had Surtees and Lorenzo Baldini as their drivers (Phil Hill, along with not being given a car to race in his home GP in 63, was also fired by the team...). Surtees, the former motorcycle champion, would prove a worthy challenger to Lotus’ domination and after Clark had three retirements in the last 5 races, win the title, becoming the first (and only to this day) driver to win the top class of racing on both 2 and 4 wheels.

Clark did win the British GP (and at Zandvoort and Spa), but it was a miserable year otherwise. He started from pole 5 times, he set the fastest lap 4 times, but also retired from the lead three times and, in the end, he couldn’t compete with Surtees’ reliable Ferrari.

Again he went to Indy and again he was the class of the field. And again his car broke down and he went home with nothing but the admiration and respect of his competitors to show for his efforts.

**1965**

But 1965 would see [Clark finally triumph](https://imgur.com/F1WQTp7) on the Brickyard. And what a triumph it was. The first foreigner to win the Indy 500 since 1916, winning the largest prize ever for a motorsport event (a Mustang, one year supply of meat – delivery to Scotland not included –, two TVs and, to his dismay, photoshoots with supermodels, the cover of Time magazine, and TV interviews). Clark hated everything about that, his shyness becoming worse and worse.

During one week after the 500, he covered 6.500 kms in 7 days, crisscrossing the USA on one PR obligation after another. But it was all deserved since no one had ever seen someone from outside the country completely obliterate the competition (he won with 2 laps over second place).

He wanted to go back to Scotland and rest, but the Formula 1 season was underway (he missed the Monaco GP for Indy) and he was determined to win the title again. For the season, Scotland would have another one of its sons joining the ranks, as Stewart was to start racing for BRM (he would finish the year third in points, winning the Italian GP).

But Clark was untouchable again. Even though he finished the Italian GP P10 (he was leading but a fuel pump issue ended his day) and retired from the last two races, USA and Mexico (first win by Honda in F1, by the way, with Ritchie Ginther driving), so his year ended on a low note, he had won every race until then, Monaco excluded obviously, and the title was never in doubt.

South Africa, Spa, the French GP at Charade (which is an awesome track, for those that don’t know it, like a French Nürburgring, obviously completely unusable now due to safety concerns), Silverstone (fourth British GP in a row), Zandvoort (third in a row), Nürburgring, they were all his to play with. Of the 9 races he took part in, he sat in pole in 6 of them, set the fastest lap in 5, led in all of them except Mexico. It was simply a stunning display by Clark and Lotus. Clark became the only person in history to win the Indy 500 and the Formula 1 title in the same year, a feat never replicated. He had even taken his old Lotus 25 (they had upgraded to the [33](https://imgur.com/2wVh74w) that year) to France, for one last win with it.

There was simply no one who could stand in the way of [Clark and Chapman’s cars](https://imgur.com/XHajb4O). Their relationship was almost paternal now, with Chapman serving as translator of Clark’s observations to the team, improving the cars constantly. The team knew that Clark was almost as important as Chapman and treated both with reverence. The atmosphere at Lotus was said to have been brilliant during this period, with all the hard work being welcomed by the team, for they knew that the work would be rewarded with Clark extracting everything the car had to give.

Stewart, having shared the podium with Clark three times, commented at the end of the year that they were now known as Batman and Robin, “but everyone knew who Batman was”. However, even if he was Robin to Clark’s Batman (and they were getting even tighter, with Hill joining the fraternity, which began being called The 3 Musketeers), Stewart and the rest of the paddock could not understand how he was so much faster than everyone else was, even drivers in the same machinery. Legends abound, obviously, and each person had one idea for the reason. 

Stewart has always maintained that Clark was simply smoother than everyone else, driving with a finesse that made it seem as if he was caressing the car, instead of driving it to the limit, never fighting the car. Withmore, on the other hand, felt that his sensitivity was the key, because Clark could feel things that even other racing drivers simply could not. 

Seltzer, his mechanic at the start, had many theories about how he could be fast in an F1 car, in a Ford Cortina (in which he took every turn on 3 wheels, using it to win the British Touring Car Championship in 1963), in sportscars, it never mattered, he was always fast. He also once said that what impressed him the most was that everyone analysed what he did, but no one could ever figure out why this Scot could be such a good driver. In his book about his time in Formula 1, Seltzer said, about Clark’s treatment of the car: “There have been many stories about the tyres on Jim Clark's car lasting four races. This is true, but also the brake pads lasted three times longer than those any other driver. Derek Wild used to say that you could put all the gearboxes on the bench in front of him in random order and he could tell which gearbox came out of Jim's car as it showed less signs of wear.”

He simply was that good. Clark, in his usual simplicity, had a definite answer (that never satisfied anyone): ““I don’t drive faster, I just concentrate harder and that makes me go faster”. For him, it really was simple like that. He sat in the car, focused all his attention to driving it fast and the car responded to his wishes, going fast (more often than not faster than anyone else could).

Even if no one could explain why it happened, the reality was the Clark was again the World Champion and once he returned to Scotland, the reception was again glorious. Everyone seemed to want to show their appreciation for his accomplishments. Just five years earlier, his father had told him to either make it pay or quit his hobby. Now, because of his hobby, Jim Clark and his family went to Buckingham Palace to meet the Queen and he was earning very good money.

**1966**

For the new season, regulations had been changed so that engines would now be 3 litres, instead of 1.5, and it was with anticipation that the teams turned up for the first race of the season at Monaco. This was not only the first race for the McLaren team, but also when the Monaco scenes for *Grand Prix* were shot (if you have not watched it, please do so at your earliest convenience, it’s a great movie). The film’s director, John Frankenheimer, asked McLaren to not race in the traditional New Zealand colours, but in white and green, so that the car could be used as the Yamura car for the movie. It’s a good thing Frankenheimer was a good director, because Bruce lasted only 9 laps in the race.

Clark seemed to be in fine form, putting the car on pole, but once the race started, things quickly unravelled. He was overtaken at the start by Surtees and had to battle for sports until his suspension gave out while dicing with Hill. The other Musketeer, Stewart, won the race for BRM.

Next up, the Belgian GP at mighty Spa (again, parts of *Grand Prix* were shot during this race – seriously, the movie is incredibly good, go watch it). Phil Hill drove the first lap with a camera on the nose of the car.

The race started under a tremendous storm and the obvious happened: chaos. Seven drivers crashed in the first lap, including Hill and Bondurant at the Masta Kink, where Stewart would also crash and become trapped under his car, with fuel leaking from it and forming a pool around him, until the other two borrowed a toolkit from a local nearby and freed him, after 25 minutes of terror for the trapped Scot. There was so much water on the track and Clark’s engine flooded and he was also forced to retire. Incredibly, Phil Hill was able to complete the first lap in his camera car, avoiding the carnage around him.

From this day on, Stewart became a consummate advocate for safety, a crusade that he held firm to (even if he got a lot of flak for it throughout) and had an extremely important impact on the developments of the next few years in that regard.

As the teams travelled to France, Clark’s luck was not only not improving, but getting worse with every race. This time, he would be hit in the face by a bird during practice and not even start the race. Jack Brabham, driving for his own team, won the first of four straight races. Although Clark would eventually score a P4 and a P3 (Brands Hatch and Zandvoort), the year was lost as he retired at the Nürburgring (John Taylor and Jackie Ickx had an accident in the first lap, in which Taylor was badly burned, eventually dying from his wounds), at Monza, and in Mexico, managing one win at Watkins Glen as the sole highlight of the season. 

If Clark and Chapman’s relationship were to be any closer, Clark would have probably left Lotus, since the ended the year absolutely distraught (and he always signed one-year deals only, so he was always able to choose where to go next ¬– even if he never chose anything other than Lotus). 

**Paris**

During the 1966 season, Clark was convinced by his accountants (probably the only people, other than the ones that paid him, who knew how much he was earning) that, if he remained a taxpayer in British soil, he would pay too much and that he should choose another place to move to and become what was known as a tax exile. The downside to this plan? He wouldn’t be able to step in British territory for a full year.

He was uncertain about how this would make him feel, but he chose Paris as his exile home. Along with the two other Musketeers and their families, Clark was beginning to enjoy life outside motor racing and outside Scotland. The big family of Clark (and Sally), the Stewarts, and the Hills (who already had a boy called Damon by this time) would travel together, spending all their free time with one another. They had gone to Australia in the beginning of 1965 and 1966 so that Clark could compete in the Tasman Series (he won it with a [Lotus 32B](https://imgur.com/u8OoWSG) and would do so again in 1967 and 1968) and as 1967 began, they did the same thing. Along with their families, they all enjoyed the summer in the Southern Hemisphere, having copious amounts of fun, enjoying being together without any pressure.

The exile, however, was not going to be easy on Clark and because Sally still had her life in Britain, their relationship was the first casualty of that period. Everyone agreed that it was a shame, as Surtees once pointed out “she was the love of his life”, but Sally, in an interview a few years later, would comment that it was probably for the best, considering how things eventually turned out…

**1967**

As Clark enjoyed his single life in Paris, Lotus was hard at work preparing a new car for 1967. Graham Hill was now Clark’s teammate and since the Scot couldn’t go to Britain to test the car, Hill was left in charge of the task. He was pleased with the handling, but had misgivings about the engine, but all the doubts would be erased as soon as it was put into a race. 

This was to be Chapman’s finest work, drawing inspiration from his own designs and from the Lancia D50 from 1954, the first car to use the engine as a stressed chassis component (Chapman had tried it on the 43 already). It would to be the first car to have wings (in 1968), the first car to use the legendary Cosworth DFV (by far the most successful engine ever, for which Chapman had secured an exclusive deal for the year), the first car to have sponsorship on it (becoming the Gold Leaf Lotus), and it would win 2 drivers and 2 constructors championships before it was retired.

The new [Lotus 49](https://imgur.com/bwiOeP1) was a transformational machine, but Clark would see it for the first time when they both arrived at Zandvoort for the Dutch GP, the third race of the season (he had retired from the previous two, using a 43 for South Africa and a 33 for Monaco, the race that claimed Bandini’s life).

Hill put the car on pole, while Clark could only manage P8. But the 49 would fly in Clark’s hands. Hill lasted for only 11 laps with spark plug problems, but by lap 15 Clark was leading, a position he would hold until the end, setting a new track record on his way. All of this, in a car he had never seen before first practice.

Clark got pole at Spa and led at the start, but had spark plug issues on lap 12 and finished P6 after losing time in the pits for repairs (Hill retired again with the same issues as Clark). Both cars retired at the Bugatti Circuit at Le Mans, this time the differential taking both drivers out.

It was starting to feel like 1966 would repeat itself.

Although fortunes would change at Silverstone and Clark would take pole and the win, easily outpacing the field in front of the home crowd, he would again suffer at the Nürburgring, retiring from the lead with a broken suspension, then suffer spark plug issues at Mosport (Canadian GP, another great track) and retire from the lead after starting from pole and setting the fastest lap.

By this time, Denny Hulme had 43 points and Clark was in fourth place with only 19. It did seem like the year was cursed. And Clark started worrying about what could happen to him if he had a car failure while going hard, confessing to Stewart that things were not going so well at Lotus and that his relationship with Chapman was starting to suffer due to his growing concerns over the car’s design.

**1967 Italian GP** 

Next up, the Italian GP (the first race where starting lights were used) and what could be considered Clark’s most famous drive without winning the race. Starting from pole, Clark led until lap 12, when a puncture made him enter the pits for what would be a troubled pitstop. Once he rejoined the race, Clark was a lap down in sixteenth place. From that point on, the fans witnessed magic.

Clark tore through the field, going faster and faster until he equalled his pole position time of 1:28.5 in the race. He regained the lap he lost, caught up to the leaders and took the lead of the race, ahead of Brabham and Surtees until, on the last lap, the Lotus 49 ran out of fuel, allowing Surtees and Brabham past, Clark coasting home on no fuel to finish third.

Although Surtees had won the race for Honda (the final win for Surtees and the last for the Honda team until Jenson Button’s Hungaroring victory), the Italians only wanted Clark. He was celebrated for his spirited drive, his mastery of the Lotus 49, it was a joyous day in the place that had caused him so much heartache.

Although Clark would win the two next races, at Watkins Glen and in Mexico, it would not be enough to overtake Hulme, who would take the drivers title for Brabham. Combining the entries for both Clark and Hill (and four more for third drivers), the 49 started 22 races, reaching the finish line 8 times (6 on the hands of Clark, which further underscores how gently Clark treated the car compared to everyone else). It would be a transformational car, but the first year was extremely painful…

The pain was lessened by the joys of Paris, however, as Clark discovered the benefits of being a rich man in a city with a very intense nightlife. When Stewart went to visit him, he was baffled by the transformation in Clark, how had become a much more relaxed, at ease person, now more willing to enjoy himself.

**1968**

1968 would be a year of changes in Formula 1. As Lotus lost their exclusivity for the DFV, it became the most sought after engine in the field. Mclaren built a car with it. Ken Tyrrell entered his own team, powered by Cosworth, designed by aeronautic company Matra, and driven by Jackie Stewart. 

In May, Lotus would show up to race with a car in Gold Leaf colours, kicking off the unlimited sponsorship era in F1. Wings started appearing on the cars (Lotus again being the first one). McLaren won their first race at Spa, only the third time a driver had won a race with a car his own team had manufactured (Dan Gurney was the other one). Gurney used a full-face helmet for the first time, after using it at the Indy 500 that year (in some years FIA would make it mandatory).

But the year started as it had ended: with Lotus and Clark victorious. The South African Grand Prix was held on New Year’s Day and the team was in top form. Clark and Hill started from the first two positions and that is how the ended the race, with Clark scoring his 25th win, surpassing Fangio to become the record holder (until 1973, when Stewart would pass him on his way to setting the new record at 27).

After South Africa, there was to be a long break until the Spanish Grand Prix, which would take place in May. So many F1 drivers went to Australia to compete in the Tasman Series, with Clark winning the title for the third time.

During this period, it became clear to the 3 Musketeers and their families that Clark was trying to win his third title and retire. He talked to the other two drivers that he was starting to worry about what he would do once he stopped racing, since he knew he could not do it forever, even if he really did enjoy racing, and he would have to stop at some point, go back to Scotland and raise a family. He also confided in Stewart, who by then was a very known advocate for safety in racing, that he did think of the dangers sometimes, especially if there were trees around a track.

An answer to negativity,"Hello my fellow redditors. I've been thinking for a few weeks now about what exactly has been happening in regards to the SC2 community, and decided to post my own thoughts on the matter, in particular the growing negativity. We've all seen the ""The world is ending"" posters. Some of these are of course harmless trolls, but I feel that they're getting more and more frequent, and more and more people are starting to think that SC2 is in grave trouble. So, without further a-do, i'll jump right into it.

1. Starcraft 2 viewership is not shrinking:

http://tortedelini.wordpress.com/2013/09/02/a-real-decline-or-the-filtered-growth-of-starcraft-ii/ is my source for this statement. We can clearly see on the graph (around half way down the page) that, indeed, since the release of HotS, viewership dropped slightly. This is easily explained as something other than ""SC2 is dying!!"". After a new game/expansion comes out, the hype factor plays a huge role, in all domains. Prior to the HotS release, viewer numbers dropped. This again can easily be explained, by the hype factor. Everyone one was awaiting desperately HotS to come out, and lots of people stopped watching WoL, because in a matter of weeks/days, the matches would be irrelevant. What's more, we have seen pretty good to excellent numbers for recent tournaments. Take the WCS season 2 finals. All streams combined, (English, Chinese, Korean are the main ones, though our fellow SC2 players watching the streams in France, Germany, Russia helped the numbers quite a bit as well) the finals were at 200k. That is insane when you look at the player base of SC2. People regularily quote LoL viewership numbers as proof that SC2 is out of the running as an e-Sport, and cannot hope to survive. But Riot can quote somewhere along the lines of 40 million seperate accounts, whereas SC2 is no where near that. Of course individual streams will have far more viewers, if you have a larger viewer base. Now, this leads on to my next topic, which is actual player base (which directly effects viewer base).

2. Starcraft 2 is unforgiving:

This is a fact that I think we can all agree on. In individual games, a mistake can cost you the game. And overall, unless you play regularily, you'll be getting worse compared to the main mass of players, your relative skill will therefore drop. Now, I'm not saying that LoL/DotA2 are easy games. However, they are more casual friendly. I wish to expand on that point, but I will give an anecdotal (and therefore statistically irrelevant) example: I had a friend who used to pretty much only play SC2. He was a mid gold Zerg. When DotA2 was released, he began to phase out SC2, and increased the amount of DotA2 played. Nowadays, he doesn't have HotS, and has clocked an insane amount of hours on DotA2. What was is reason for making the switch? (And I quote)""SC2 was to stressful. I felt I had to be in top shape to play 1v1s. Whereas DotA2, I can just log on, even if I'm tired, hung over, ill, and just knock out a load of games, and it doesn't really matter"". What does that say about SC2 as a game? It means that, to a lot of people, this game is not appealing. It's hard to just log on, whatever, whenever, and have a good time, because it stretches your decision making/multitasking/reaction times to their max, whether at Bronze league or in GM. This is where the team aspect of LoL/DotA2 comes in. As cited in the answers to Teflon's article, Khaldor said that whatever goes wrong can be blamed on someone else. 

This fact appeals to a human's psychy. When you lose at LoL/DotA2 it was because the jungler wasn't doing his job, or the carry was useless, etc... If you lose at SC2, well... it's your own damn fault. You didn't see that drop. You didn't scout his proxy. You didn't split properly. This means it's your actions, and only yours, that are directly reponsible for your feelings of frustration after a loss, whereas in LoL/DotA2, there are scapegoats. (On an unrelated note, this is also why balance whine threads are so common, people want to find someway to explain their loses which isn't their fault, therefore confirming that, in their head, they are still the better player).

Of course a more forgiving game will attract more players. It's basic psychology. If one task, if failed, is less frustrating than another, most people will prefer that task. The thing that means that there are still SC2 players is because either we like the dueling aspect, or some people love to learn from their mistakes, others prefer the individual responsiblity. The reasons are your own. If a game has a larger player pool, then of course it has more people log in, and therefore more people who can see that Tournament X is going on, and therefore more people (in absolute numbers, not necessarily relative to overall player base) will be on the streams. It's basic math. But isn't SC2 being squeezed out of e-Sports?

3. There is sufficient space for vastly different games to live in a same e-space:

From a more historically point of vue, remember back to the years where Broodwar was the main e-Sport, undeniable champion of viewer numbers. Was Broodwar the only e-Sport? Of course not, Counter-strike, Quake, the fighter games, then later on WC3 and WoW. Did Broodwar die out? No. Did any of the other games get ""squeezed"" out of the e-Sport scene? No.

Another example is professional sports. For instance, did you know that the most watched league in the world is associated to.... Cricket? Yep, because of India. Is there a risk that, because, on a weekly basis, cricket gets more views (I am disregarding short term special tournaments, such as the World Cup, Super Bowl, etc... These numbers (of which I can't find the source currently) are over a league), that football, or basketball, or handball, or rowing will be ""squeezed"" out of the sports scene? Of course not. They are different sports, that appeal to different crowds. Some people love watching football AND basketball, and have to make choices. This last point is particularily pertinent to the SC2 scene in regards to LoL/DotA2.

SC2 is sufficiently different from LoL/DotA2 that they can all exist in a same space. Different people will watch different things, and that's it.

4. ""Sponsorship is going primarily to LoL/DotA2, and less to SC2"":

Yes, that is a fact. No way to get around that. But that is totally normal. What is sponsorship? It's a company that gives you money, and in return you get eyes on their products, their name. The more eyes, the easier it is to get sponsorship deals. It's totally normal then that games like LoL/DotA2 are getting a bigger slice of the sponsorship pie than SC2. It wouldn't make sense from a business point of vue if it was the other way around. In fact, it would most probably lead to another bubble (and yes SC2 as already had a bubble, remember when we had NASL, IPL, MLGs, Dreamhacks, GSL, Homestory cups, and endless other small tournaments going on simultaneously? It was unsustainable).

5. ""More and more players are retiring. This is proof that the game is shrinking"":

Again, can't deny that recently, we've seen a number of retirements, mainly in Korea and NA. Look at the past week. Light, Flying, Bisu, s2, JangBi from Korea. Surely this means that the game is shrinking? Not at all. In fact, retirements are a sign that the scene is doing well. Other players are stepping up, and pushing these slightly older players into retirement, which means that in Korea at least the next generation of InNovations, Jaedongs and Bisus are going to get their chance. Renewing the scene is a good thing. What's more, these are players who either haven't been doing as well recently, or that have been struggling to make the switch the SC2. The obvious exception is JangBi, who retired for his own personal reasons.

And what about the NA scene? Surely that's in trouble? There is no doubt that out of the three scenes, NA is struggling the most. There is a certain lack of mid-skill tournaments where up and comers can make a name for themselves. However, there are all the academies in the NA (Root, Fnatic, etc..) helping players. What's more, (and this is a personal point of view) I personally believe that the NA scene was over saturated with pro-players like a year and a half ago. It of course does suck when we see that so-and-so couldn't make it as a pro, but that happens in real sports as well. How many thousands of talented unknowns don't make it in football or basketball? And these are sports where the follow up system is far more developped, with headhunters, academies, etc..",https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/1mmx8j/an_answer_to_negativity/,Cybugger,2013-09-18 16:46:30,283,starcraft
Rohit and Kohli are done. They're only hanging around because of the money that keeps rolling because of the brands that they are.,"Rohit and Kohli seem mentally done with cricket. Rohit just wanted to win an ICC trophy. 

He wanted the ODI World Cup real bad but he bottled it, and then he managed to dig deep and find motivation to win the T20 World Cup in West Indies.

After the T20 World Cup win, he got such a huge orgasmic release that he has still not come out of the refractory post orgasm phase.

He seems to have let go of whatever little fitness routine he had left and looks even more bloated than before.

He is mentally still playing with the T20 / ODI opener approach even in tests.

After being around for 15 years if you cannot make even this much adjustment, then what's even the point of you being captain and in the XI.

Add to this, real bad captaincy — misreading the pitch, bad field placements, ultra defensive approach, etc.

Kohli was done with Indian cricket after he was shunted out of captaincy.

He managed to make a bit of a comeback with some sparkling innings here and there (eg. vs Pak in 2022 T20 World Cup)

He managed to get back to his beastly self in 2023 ODI World Cup and gave it his all, but after losing that he seems to have run out of steam and motivation.

He has also shifted base to London which means while playing in India, Kohli's body needs to undergo a similar sort of acclimatisation as when English players come to India.

No wonder he's playing spin the same way Englishmen play spin in India — in a clueless manner.

The only reason they seem to be hanging around is because of the hundreds of crores that roll into their bank accounts each year because of the brand value created over 15 years of playing cricket.

After the T20 World Cup win they must have further increased their sponsorship fees and now they're just around to milk that cow for the next 1-2 years or until BCCI decide to pull the unlimited rope given to them.

Kohli and Rohit's peak and their best days are well and truly behind them. The sooner they pass on the baton and leave — the better it will be for their career, their legacy and for Indian cricket.

SRH won by 67 runs

**Bhuvneshwar Kumar:**  ""(Rate that bowling performance) When defending those many runs, you either go for plenty or you get wickets. We accepted that we'll go for plenty of runs when defending those many runs, but the plan was to keep executing. (Own form) Feeling good. Not among the wickets but the way I want to execute it is happening. Just a matter of time. (Natarajan's season) Amazing. We know how good he is at yorkers. He keeps working hard, silent guy, goes unnoticed a lot. We know how important he is for Sunrisers. (SRH's batting in 2024 - impressive?) For so many years, this is the first time where our batting is clicking so much. As a bowling unit, happy to take the back seat. They are ruining us (smiles), when we defend 180 or so, it'll feel like less. (They play same way in nets?) Yes, same, especially Head and Abhishek, playing same way. Batters sometimes play opposite in the nets, but they play the same way. (How will the IPL be won - will it be bowling?) Bowling is something .... somebody says batting wins your sponsorship, but bowling wins you championship. The way we are bowling right now looks bad on the scorecard but it is pretty good for us.""

15 things I HATE about Film Festivals,"The last three years have been a wild ride. I’ve been fortunate enough to be apart of three short films and a feature, and I’ve had more than my fair share of success at film festivals. Part of that success came from how prepared we were and which steps we took to give each film its best shot. This meant homework; lots of it. I’m constantly reading articles, blogs, and listening to panels chalk full of festival programmers. They love giving tips, tricks, and advice on how to get your movie into festivals. That is, until they start going down the “don’t do” list. It seems every festival programmer has a laundry list of pet peeves that filmmakers should avoid. After reading [dozens of these articles] (http://filmfestivalsecrets.com/tips-tricks-advice-bible/), and after talking face-to-face with programmers from every walk of life, something hit me. The Movie-to-Film-Festival relationship should be a two way street. There’s tons of material out there about what festival programmers hate to see, but what about the other way around? I’ve been to a ton of festivals; some major ones, some small ones, and everything in-between. All in all I’ve seen some trends that could use a little fixin’. 

So here it is – 15 things I hate about festivals, by an Anonymous Redditor 

**NO COMMUNICATION** – It’s ironic; festivals always say, “Communication is key” I hear this time and again! If you listen to podcasts, read blogs, and watch panels, programmers always tout how much they love it when filmmakers communicate with them. Mind you, this doesn’t mean tug on their sleeve every other day and ask if they’ve seen your movie yet. But sharing the occasional bit of press, or if your lead actor got a role in a show is always a good thing. They want to hear how excited you are to screen at their festival! But if you keep them in the loop don’t expect to hear a peep back. Some festivals might respond to your emails with a “Great! We’ll pass it along!”(They never pass it along by the way) however most festivals go dark. If you play the festival circuit long enough you’ll find that reaching out to most festivals is as engaging as talking with a brick wall. I’ve even asked vital questions that don’t get a response…ever. These aren’t dumb questions either, they may have to do with screening information or premiere status that is curiously vacant from their festival website. Oh and don’t expect any updates from festivals either. You see, most programmers don’t understand that communication is a two way street. While they expect you to update them with trailers and press they don’t feel obligated to give you the most basic information about the programming process. Remember when I said don’t tug on their sleeve every other day and ask about your movie? Yeah, don’t do that, but if 6 months goes by and you haven’t heard anything at all from a festival, I think it’s fully within our rights as filmmakers to ask for an update. Programmers claim they want to hear from you, but they’ll never clue you into what’s going on behind the curtain.   

**NO REJECTION LETTER** – This one really gets my blood boiling. There are a million reasons a film might be rejected by a festival, but there is ZERO excuse for not notifying a filmmaker of their rejection. I can’t count the times I’ve anxiously waited for a notification date to arrive… then crickets. A day later, still nothing. A week? Nope. If I spent my cold hard cash paying your entry fee and you don’t want to program my film, fine, but the very least you can do is send a rejection letter ON THE DAY YOU SAY YOU WILL! Not 3 weeks after, or in some cases never, but on the actual notification date. Festival directors and programmers will dredge every possible reason from “check your spam” to “we’re overwhelmed” to excuse their lack of communication. Don’t buy into it. Truth be told if you’ve been accepted to a festival 90% of the time they will tell you before the notification date. If a notification date passes by and you haven’t heard anything from the festival, that means they are lazy, unorganized, incompetent, or the winning combination of all three. If you don’t have the common courtesy to tell me I’m not in your festival, I will NEVER submit again.   

**NOT WATCHING YOUR FILM** – You know that sinking feeling you get when you’re reading over a rejection letter (if they sent one) and you think, “did they even watch my movie?” You might not be too far off the mark. Here’s a couple of dirty secrets. Programmers are lazy. They don’t want to watch your movie. They say they do, but they don’t. They really don’t. Would you want to watch thousands of films piling up on your desk? If you said “yes” please seek mental help, but if you’re sane and said “no” then you my friend could be a festival programmer. A festival will usually watch a small portion of your film, for shorts usually 5 minutes, and features usually 15-20. In that time they will either give the film a recommendation to go onto the next round or throw it in the rejection pile. Now ask yourself this; if you were watching a clearly amateur movie how long would you need to make that determination? 90 minutes? No. 60? Nope. 10? Still no. Most people can see if a movie is going to be good or not in the first 30 seconds. That’s all you have. 30 seconds. Everything past 30 seconds is gravy. With programmers sifting through hundreds of films its no wonder they don’t give every 25 minute “short” it’s full due. If you can’t impress them in a few seconds then why would they suffer…I mean, sit, through your film. Hey! It sounds like I’m on the programmer’s side! Well… I sort of am. I sympathize at least. When it comes to movies some are better than others and it doesn’t take the full run time to see it. All of that said, we the filmmakers put our trust into festivals. They say they consider everything so they had better sit down and consider it. We paid a submission fee so they had better sit down and watch the whole film. If they aren’t going to that’s okay, give me my money back. Not going to give my money back? Then don’t lie about watching the films and “carefully considering each submission” [because you aren’t] (https://nofilmschool.com/2017/05/film-festivals-submissions-actually-watch-your-movie). With new tools like Vimeo that track views, and new analytics programs, it’s getting easier to catch programmers in the act…or lack thereof. So Programmers, watch our movies. We paid your outrageous fee now it’s time for you to keep your end of the deal. 

**THE BOY’S CLUB** – Remember when independent film festivals were about independent films? Yeah, me neither. The sad truth is the majority of film festivals are a boy’s club. If you want to play, you need to know someone at the festival. For the bulk of filmmakers this means you don’t have a shot of getting in. It’s scary how hijacked all the significant festivals have become. Where once undiscovered talent was given a stage to flourish now has become the weekend getaway of the Hollywood elite. That’s an honest-to-God assessment of film festivals. The amount of celebrities and corporate sponsorships has exploded, and if you don’t have a friend holding open the door to the party, you’ll be left out in the cold. Programmers always say “We judge each film on its merits and don’t play favorites.” Guess what? That’s a bold faced lie – and one most filmmakers are getting sick of hearing. This used to be only problematic for the larger festivals but as the years have drug on the boy’s club mentality has infected even the mid-tier and local festivals. It’s gotten so bad some festivals are actually advertising how many non-alumni are screening. Years ago that would have been a red flag, but today its business as usual. The reality is if you don’t know a programmer, festival director, screener, or anyone else at the festival, you’re pushed to the back of the line. I’ll be the first to admit knowing people at festivals has gotten me in the door – but does that make it right? Maybe, maybe not, but in a landscape of increasing saturation and more difficulty than ever standing out from the crowd, the last things filmmakers should have to consider is, “do I have a buddy or a long lost cousin that runs the festival?” Imagine if heart surgeons only got a shot because their friend recommended them, and not because they were actually good at their job. Compound this problem with waivers and invitations soaking up [half the available slots] (http://therumpus.net/2016/05/the-great-film-festival-swindle/) and it seems less and less likely that you’ll get your movie into a festival.

**NAMES** – It’s no secret film festivals want to sell tickets. They are, after all, a business. And the best way to do that? Have name talent attached to the movies they’re screening! So why is this a problem? It means the 99% of us that don’t have names attached to our movies have to work that much harder to be considered by a festival. How many times have you seen a short film or indie feature with some name talent and thought “Oh my God, this is painfully mediocre.” Well… it happens. A lot. And the heartbreaking part is when you consider that lackluster drama/romcom/horror with that one b-lister most likely shoved a better movie out of the way. I’m not saying that every film with name talent is bad, or that every film without is good (My feature has some names, and I like to think it’s alright) But it’s funny how programmers always talk about “giving each film equal attention” but rarely reject a movie with recognizable names in favor of one without. 

**“WE ARE LOOKING FOR THE BEST MOVIES!”** – No you’re not…. Oh, I need to go into detail. Okay. This is one of the BIGGEST LIES festivals tell filmmakers. While it’s true they want to screen good movies, festivals are always thinking [about their bottom line.] (https://stephenfollows.com/the-economics-of-film-festivals/) That means ticket sales. Herein lies the problem; the “best” films don’t always sell the most tickets. It’s the same fallacy you see on every movie forum on the internet. Audiences are tired of seeing reboots, remakes, and franchise films; they’re eager for fresh ideas and great cinema… then the box office numbers come in. Super hero movie gets 1 billion, original movie with great cast/execution/concept only makes back a few bucks. Programmers know this, and should amend their mantra to say “We are looking for the best movies that will ALSO sell the most tickets.” Now what this means varies from person to person, but generally they want films that appeal to a wider audience, and that have a bigger cast and crew. Why the big cast and crew? More cast and crew = more friends and family = more ticket sales. I don’t hold it against them. They need to make money too. After all most festivals will swallow the cost of an empty theater now and again to screen something truly great. However, during internal meetings and discussions the topic of ticket sales is brought up more than once. If two movies are up against each other programmers will, 9 times out of 10, select the one they think will pack the theater. This usually means going with a film that has a better-known cast, a genre most people like, more social media presence, or better production value. Speaking of which…

**PRODUCTION VALUE** – Festivals will always lean toward movies that have a higher production value. This doesn’t always mean, “better looking cinematography” but it is a combination of size of cast, locations in the movie, and general look of the film. This is one of the few areas where a STELLAR STORY trumps the scale of the film, however, generally festivals will trend toward a movie with more “stuff” in it. Is your film a contained drama with a couple of characters and a simple plot?  You’re going to get passed over. No matter how good the acting is or how well written it is, if another movie has bigger effects or a more exotic location, you’ll be bumped. I’m not saying that production value guarantees you’ll get into a festival but it sure helps. All things being equal programmers feel the bigger a movie they screen, the more value their own festival has. As I said this is one of the rare points on this list that an excellent story will win out over a flashy movie – but don’t leave it up to chance. 

**“WE WANT UNIQUE STORIES/IDEAS/VOICES/FILMS!”** – I honestly believe programmers honestly believe this. While most things programmers say are outright lies or shallow half-truths, I think this is a case of intention vs. action. In my heart of hearts when I hear a programmer say they want unique voices and original ideas I want to believe them. However, in practice it’s rarely the case. Why? Programmers are people. And people are creatures of habit. Don’t believe me? That’s okay, and it’s debatable. But I challenge you to look up any given 20 festivals in the U.S. and watch the trailers of the official selections the past 3 years. Most have the same tone/style/theme. And this tone/style/theme repeats year after year with very little variation. While programmers may WANT new ideas and points of view, they often stick to the old familiar. As I said – programmers are people. People like what they like. 

**BITTER AND JADED PROGRAMMERS** – I’ve been to a number of mixers at various levels of festivals; big festivals, local festivals, you name it. And my favorite part is talking with the programmers. Not right away, but once the party has been going on for a while and they’ve had a few drinks, because the honesty comes POURING out. And while most the stories I hear are funny or insightful, a growing trend is the angry, cynical programmer. The guy that hates EVERYTHING. The guy who is impossible to impress. They guy who you wonder, “why are you even here?” Maybe he liked movies one time, but that day has long since passed. I guess it makes sense. After all a programmer’s job is to pick films apart – much like a critic. And programmers have to sit though hundreds of hours of films, many with technical problems or similar themes and stories. I can see how it’s exhausting. But if you carry bitterness toward movies with you, especially in a room full of filmmakers, you have no business being a programmer. If you are a programmer and you’re reading this, your first instinct is probably, “well I’m not bitter and jaded.” Maybe. Maybe you are fair and balanced. I’ll leave the introspection up to you. But is there anyone on your programming team that IS cynical? If so… why are you trusting the future of our films with that guy? [General crabbiness] (https://psychcentral.com/blog/the-trust-gap-why-people-are-so-cynical/) is a growing trend and these types of people are becoming more and more common. Filmmakers, be aware that programmers are becoming more and more irritable. When a programming team gets hit with 3,000 submissions they aren’t looking for “good” movies in the first couple or rounds, they are looking for a reason to toss your film into the rejection pile. If you survive the culling then maybe, maybe, MAYBE, they’ll give your movie a fair shot… maybe.  

**DIVERSITY FOR THE SAKE OF DIVERSITY** – I feel like I’m about to open a can of worms with this one so let me preface with a few things.

* Minority focused festivals – I have no problem with these. An African American focused film festival no more discriminates against a White filmmaker than does a comedy film festival discriminate against a horror film. If a festival has a specific type/genre/theme, that’s a-ok.

* Minority focused programs – Same as above, but on a smaller scale. If a film festival has a program for LGBT or Women or Jewish films or whatever, it’s not discrimination – it’s the theme. Theme away.

* Grants for minorities – I feel like a broken record, but the same as above applies here.

* Programs, Workshops, Mentorships etc. for minorities – I think you get my drift. Important, vital in some circumstances, and often necessary in shepherding a new generation of filmmakers into the industry. I’m not just “okay” with these; I understand how critical they are for many people. 

 
When a festival programs a movie because they want the festival to be more “diverse” they’re slitting the throat of one filmmaker for their own ego. Let’s cut to it; “diverse” in Hollywood speak means “no white men”. We’ll argue semantics later. If two equally good films are in the running for one slot, and one film gets programmed over the other for the sole reason of “diversity” the festival is doing a disservice to themselves and the filmmakers. If a film has better story, or better characters, or is just generally a better film and happens to be “diverse” then I’m all for screening it! Let me say that one more time to really drive the message home. If a film has better story, or better characters, or is just generally a better film and happens to be “diverse” then I’m all for screening it. But if a film gets programmed simply to hit some imaginary quota of underrepresented filmmakers, you aren’t pushing the agenda of diversity; you’re patting yourself on the back for being “aware”. To put it another way – the object of equality is to push those “without” up, not pull those “with” down. I for one have never understood why people care about a director’s gender or skin color – shouldn’t the film speak for itself? If your first reaction reading this is, “but we need more diversity!” Go back to the top of this section and start reading again. I’m not against building diversity. I’m against the growing trend of festivals that now consider the gender, race, age, and sexual orientation of the filmmaker when they have no business doing so. If those things matter to programmers they should create a separate block, or separate festival, otherwise just the movies as movies. 

**THEY WANT YOUR VIRGINITY, BUT THEY WON’T DATE YOU FOR IT** – [I once read] (https://www.moviemaker.com/archives/festivals/absolute-submission-top-programmers-film-festivals/) that the World Premiere of your movie is a lot like your virginity, and once it’s gone, it’s gone. I love that comparison. Filmmakers need to think carefully about where they host their World Premiere, and there is [no shortage of options] (https://stephenfollows.com/many-film-festivals-are-in-the-world/) (btw that article is from 2013. It’s gotten a lot crazier since). World Premieres are more important for features than shorts, but when you consider North American Premieres, Individual Country or Region Premiere, and even City and State Premieres, it can get complicated. Worst part is, there is a growing number of festivals, big and small, the REQUIRE a premiere or some sort. That’s fine and all, but what’s in it for me? If you have a feature film many regional, top tier, and mid-tier festivals want a world premiere. Even if they don’t come out and say it behind closed doors it’s usually a consideration. Okay- you want my virginity, what are you going to do to work for it? Oh, nothing? Programmers put themselves on a pedestal. They feel that filmmakers should be grateful for the opportunity to screen at their festival. News flash, we are thankful! We are so thankful! But maybe, just maybe, send some of that love back to us. After all people buy tickets to see OUR films. I’ve spoken with dozens of filmmakers that have submitted to Festival A but not to Festival B because of a conflict with premieres. But what happens when they don’t get into Festival A? They blew their chances with both. Or what happens if they submit to both, get into Festival A, but would prefer to premiere with Festival B (just to add insult to injury, Festival B is usually dead silent on the issue) Programmers want our premiers but they rarely, if ever, do anything to entice or incentivize a filmmaker to host their premiere with them. Worse, when there is a conflict of premieres, the festival in question usually just tosses the film into the rejection pile and shoots a quick “Congrats on getting into Festival A. We wish you luck.” And the case is closed. If you want my premiere GIVE ME SOMETHING. A guaranteed screening slot for example, or an interview, or a seat on a panel. I submitted to you so obviously I want to be apart of your festival. But if I have to sacrifice the possibility of screening at another festival to satisfy you, it’s only fair that you offer to do something for me – even if it’s something small. 

**NO MARKETING** – Let me be loud and clear about this. Filmmakers! You, and only you, are the best marketing tool for your film. No one cares as much as you do. No one will ever work as hard as you will to promote your film. It’s 2018 – the age of the director is dead. A filmmaker is equal parts marketer and storyteller. Don’t like it? Quit. Because that’s the reality. If you aren’t doing everything possible to promote and advocate your movie, then you aren’t doing your job. Got it?! Good. Now… I hate when film festivals don’t promote their movies. I hate it so damn much. We spend years writing scripts, scrounging up money, casting, slogging through paperwork and permits, working to death on a set for weeks at a time, dodging a minefield of issues and problems, suffering through post; and when it’s all done we submit to a festival and wait 4-7 months for a response which is usually, “no”. But when we get the occasional “yes, you’re in!” we are pumped! We are ready! We make posters and trailers and schedule talks on podcasts and radio shows, and do interviews, and drum up social media support, and get all excited for the big day! It’s been years of blood, sweat, and tears to make our movie but we’re finally ready to show it at the big festival!...so what does the festival do? They make a post on facebook. They create an event. They invite THE OTHER FILMMAKERS IN THE FESTIVAL and no one else. Programmers and festival directors are lazy (I think I said that earlier) They expect you to do ALL of the promotion on your own, and will barely lift a finger to get the word out about your movie. Sometime they will talk with a local newspaper (who reads those anyway) about the festival, but that’s just about it. Actually this is one of the few things on this list that bigger festivals are less guilty of than smaller festivals. Nonetheless, if a festival makes a few tweets and a facebook post about your film and that’s it, they aren’t pulling their weight. Unfortunately that’s the lion’s share of festivals. 

**WHERE ARE THE INDUSTRY PEOPLE?** – Why do you go to festivals? Is it to meet other filmmakers? Is it to get your film in front of audiences? Is it to promote your movie? All of the above? Whatever the reason, any festival worth their salt should invite industry people. These are producers, distributors, agents, managers, financers, and other movers and shakers. So where are they? Sure lots of festivals have people who *SAY* they are these things… but, no… they aren’t. So where are the real players? Just like in marketing most festivals expect filmmakers to invite these people to the screenings. That’s all well and good, except these people don’t care about us. If they did we would have probably made a bigger better film in the first place. They do, however, care about festivals. You see the festival acts as a sort of middleman between the industry people and the filmmakers. An agent may not pick up the phone or return your call, but they might (re: might) respond to a festival and drop by to check out a few films (if the ticket is comped of course). Festival directors love giving excuses on why there are no industry people at the festival but it really comes down to two things; they aren’t trying very hard, and they don’t know anyone. Trying hard means different things depending on the festival. Local film festivals should contact the state’s film counsel, the arts counsel, and regional or local film/arts groups, etc. Bigger festivals should approach distributors, production houses, and agencies directly and invite them. After all, who doesn’t like a good party where you’re treated like a V.I.P.? The second quandary is that the festival director doesn’t actually have any contacts. In that case, ask yourself this – is this really a festival I need to go to? 

**ONLINE FESTIVALS** – If you happen to run an online festival and you are reading this, I want you to say the following out loud – I AM A SCAM ARTIST! Say it again, because that’s all you are. You scam filmmakers for money. I have been lucky enough to avoid online festivals but I’ve talked with dozens upon dozens of filmmakers who all say the exact same thing. Online festivals are a scam. Every. Single. One. I honestly don’t know why people even submit. Is winning a laurel that important to you? Seriously, is it? Online film festivals charge insane fees, sometimes as much as a normal festival, to…to… um… to… put your keyart on their website? To send you a laurel as if it means anything? Bonus points if the laurel was made in FilmFreeway’s laurel generator. These festivals prey on you. Each year they make hundreds of thousands of dollars and all they have to do is host a website. What about exposure? If you really think you’ll get your big break because your poster is on the third page of some crappy website then you’re delusional. What about laurels? Other festivals, and other filmmakers for that matter, look at those laurels and laugh. What about the audience? I ask you, what audience? People don’t log online and scour the internet for hidden gems on online festivals. They just don’t. You aren’t fooling anyone. There is no reason, not a single one, to submit to an online festival. It would take a lot to convince me otherwise. If you run an online festival I beg you take a long hard look in the mirror and do some soul searching. You’re lying to yourself if you think you’re doing anything other than taking money from desperate creatives for as little overhead and risk as possible. You are not providing a service. You are spreading a cancer. 

**INSANE SUBMISSION FEES** – As if making a film wasn’t expensive enough, submitting is just as painful. I spoke with a guy recently that blew two grand on festival submissions and didn’t get into a single one. Not one. Now he went a little overboard and there is something to be said about planning and careful restraint; be that as it may this anecdote does illustrate the cost of festival submissions. Most smaller festivals I will forgive – overhead is insane. But the big festivals? Nah, I do not forgive you. I can name a half dozen festivals off the top of my head that charge $80 for their early bird submission for features. That is insane! These festivals make bank on selling tickets to workshops, panels, and screenings. Not to mention the drink tickets, opening/closing night tickets, merch, and a million other things they make money on. To boot these festivals typically have sponsorship helping to foot the bill. So why do they charge us so much? Because you’re paying for the winner’s party that’s why. Remember the boy’s club? Remember they invite most of the films they program, and those films get a waived fee? Guess what… your crazy submission fee is paying for the free drink coupons and air-fare of the people they invited to the festival. You know what’s cool? A party. You know what’s even cooler? A party where someone else is footin’ the bill. Too bad that someone else is you.  

There’s the top 15 things I hate about film festivals. Now quickly glancing over all this doom and gloom makes me want to end this on a positive note. After all festivals are amazing affairs and, if done right, can really move you and your career forward. At the beginning I mentioned I recently had 3 shorts and a feature do the rounds over the past couple of years. If film festivals were all bad, then why would I subjugate myself to 3 years of torture? Simply put; despite their flaws festivals are pretty great. 

**Programmers Want You To Succeed** Forget the fact that most programmers are filmmakers themselves, and as such are sympathetic to you and your challenges. Let’s talk cold-heartless-pragmatism. If your film does well it makes them look better. And the better they look the more submissions they get. Cynicism aside if your movie is playing a festival, programmers are in your corner. They are your first fans. They love your work and want to see it go places. 

**Festivals Aren’t Dead, They’re Different** – I read somewhere that the indie festival is dead. Not true. Sure, the days of making a low budget film, selling it to a distributor for six figure, and taking the world by storm are dead. That doesn’t mean festivals are dead. Festivals attract filmmakers. Filmmakers are your gateway to learning, growing, developing, and making more films. There is more value in that fact alone than most of the fairy tale distribution deals you’ve heard of from years past. The connections that you can build at a festival can last a lifetime. Do not squander this opportunity. 

**They’re a Great Way to Judge Trends** – We are the next generation of filmmakers. And our collective conscience ebbs and flows, whether or not we are aware of it. Festivals are a fantastic way of getting an idea of what works and what doesn’t. Thinking about making a romcom? Go to a festival, watch one, and see how the audience reacts. There is no better gauge of “what the people want” than your own two eyes.   

**Get Your Film Seen** – Believe it or not, people actually do enjoy going to festivals for the fun of it. So get your movie in front of those people! There’s no better feeling in the world watching an audience respond to your work. We didn’t make our movie so it could sit on a shelf, we made it to be seen! 

**A Million Other Reasons** – Maybe not a million but you get the idea. The internet has pages and pages of why festivals are important and beneficial. Not to mention it’s good old fashioned fun. Meeting new folks, watching movies, planning for the future, going to parties. Festivals are a blast. If you haven’t ever been to one, even if your movie isn’t playing, I strongly suggest you go!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/7ymjr6/15_things_i_hate_about_film_festivals/,AnonFilmmaker,2018-02-19 18:11:38,266,Filmmakers
Australia BBL23 advertising is actual consumer abuse.,"First off in my rant let me say I understand the place of advertising. We all understand it. We get it. It often is the financial backbone behind the content being even available for us to view. But for the love of god it has it's time and place, and I think 2023 is the beginning of the dystopian future where advertising invades every aspect of our waking (and soon to be dreaming) life. Of course this could have likely been said about any year in the last century, but let me vent anyway.

We have come to tolerate the assault of advertisements on every sense perception we humans are capable of, from being bombarded with and not limited to what I can drunkenly think of right now, including; stadium names, banners, signs, player jerseys, cricket wear and consumables, league sponsorships and programs, team names, events, fan items and gear, commentary and casting, ad breaks at constantly impractical times etc. blah blah I can go on forever...

Can we draw a line somewhere?

**Maybe can we draw a line around specific rules and terminology of the sport?** Is this the last safe space left for the consumer? The sports terminology should not be used and exploited by advertisements. Advertising is a plague that has no moral boundaries. Specific examples of this include the most aggravating I've personally ever experienced such as the Australian Big Bash Leagues ""Chemist Warehouse 4"" and the ""Toyota 6""... every live commentary call of these remarkable plays is perverted by using advertising when commented on them. Do you turn to your mate Kevin and say ""Mate did you see that Bunnings Warehouse play of the day?"".

I ponder these thoughts after visiting the memorial grave of legendary KFC's Zingers Shane Warne, and admiring his tombstone that read ""Here lies a man, a god of the game of cricket, and a huge fan of the 100 & 1000's McFlurry at McDonalds for a low price of just $5.99"". Wow, such wise words from a legend of the game... and the sponsors marketing team.

As there will be no solution to this drunken outburst, I would like to thank Bundaberg Rum & Cola for helping me with this post and I look forward to a prosperous future here on Amazon's Earth with my fellow Microsoft humans.

[Update] I've been working on a Cricket Manager game for the last 7 years,"I posted about my passion project – Wicket Cricket Manager – [a few months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/10b6e4d/ive_been_working_on_a_cricket_manager_game_for/) & was blown away by the feedback & support from this community! If you missed the original post, the tl;dr is that this is a cricket management game, similar to Football Manager, where you take charge of every aspect of your cricket club - from finances to signing players and sponsorships, to upgrading your stadium and training facilities.

Anyhow, I thought you guys might be interested in a quick update. I’ve been hard at work addressing issues & building features ya’ll called out. Specifically I

1. Remodelled the entire finance/transfer system (transfer fees are now upfront, bank loans are a thing, you can sell players to other clubs etc)
2. Finally released on the App Store
3. Added the ability to edit player avatars
4. Made the aggression slider more responsive (eg. very defensive won’t result in 6s being hit :P)
5. Made in-match bowler selection one click
6. Added Ireland & Scotland to the game
7. Changed the font to Roboto (thanks /u/trtryt)
8. ... And a bunch of other things I barely remember (broken NRR calculation, issue with multiple surrey teams etc)

I'm keen to continue evolving this game & would love any feedback if you are willing to try it out. You can download it on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playt20manager&referrer=utm_source%3Dreddit%26utm_medium%3Dbb) & the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/wicket-cricket-manager/id1608850803).

DLF maximum part 6 edition of this ongoing saga, collating opinion/analysis/discussion pieces into one place. Surely this has to be the last one of these we need. 

The Australian trio have returned home, and Darren Lehmann has just resigned. Significant new news developments/articles can be posted separately. 

Context: Australian opener Cameron Bancroft was caught using tape to alter the condition of the ball during play. Steve Smith has admitted that the Australian leadership group had planned for this to happen.

Smith, Warner, and Bancroft apparently the only people that knew of the plan. Renshaw, Burns, and Maxwell will replace the trio in the squad. Lehmann will remain as coach... until resigning a day later. 

Tim Paine officially endorsed as Australian test captain. 

Smith and Warner [have been banned by CA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/87q1m5/jim_maxwell_smith_warner_will_get_12_month_bans/) for 12 months, Bancroft for 9 months.

Breaking Down Bates,"1. Since the plane touched down from Dubai, the Stew Crew has been nonstop on the go. Their Georgia influencer friends, the Hills, showed up for nail dates, shopping trips, Dollywood and a visit to the Biltmore Estate. Tyler Hill and Evan are so enamored that Evan recites Tyler’s Starbucks order from memory, and forgets to ask Carlin if she even wants anything. Carlin is now featuring mini-vlogs on her IG which Evan says she films with her iPhone. They rerun this same content on their YouTube where he has filmed everything with his Hollywood camera. That means the kids are being filmed by both parents at all times. They must spend an enormous amount of time editing out all of the normal/gross things kids do bc all we see from Layla and Zade is the same wide eyed wonder, faux excitement and Princess smiles. Over and over they feature Zade with heavy subtitles… subtitles are much easier than speech therapy, obviously. Carlin films herself wrapping gifts so they can have fake, filmed Christmas before heading to Nashville for real Christmas. They make a huge deal of the kids choosing presents for each other and exchanging them in brown paper sacks with white paper. They have a new in home camera set up so Evan can get overhead shots. They film openly in busy stores where you can see people stopping to watch…and they think this is a flex. Evan has the starring role in the new cult church’s Christmas cantata and then we see the Pastor and his wife piled up under blankets watching movies with their children. That seems normal…Both Layla and Zade work the entire holiday season making ads for Target and Amazon. Carlin happily packs and repacks their new $2000+ luggage sets and tries to convince us she doesn’t wash her hair while pushing dry shampoo. After a quick trip to Nashville the Stewarts are off to shop for a new car, buy Gil a new iPhone and head to the mountains for Gil’s 60th birthday celebration. Carlin is able to successfully navigate the weekend without speaking to or even standing near Erin and manages to corral Tori in for a quick picture. 2025 is sure to be a big year for the Stew Crew… will it include speech therapy, a security fence around the pool OR an ounce of privacy for their children?

2.Katie Clark continues to land big partnerships. The latest is Land’s End. Meanwhile, her 1 year old is still paying the bills. Hailey is in full on sistermom training mode baby wearing her doll and helping to feed baby Harvey. The Clarks head to the mall for the 65th time this month and have their kids picture made with Santa while both are fast asleep. Katie sold letters to Santa, takes pictures with Santa but refuses to say that Santa visits her kids. Katie announces that she is undergoing a major, massive hair overhaul. This involves removing her extensions, dying her hair the same exact color and trimming 1/4 of an inch. Travis just lavishes praise on her by saying she “looks like 2019 Katie”… and she lets us know that she will likely be getting extensions added again. They film a fake Christmas morning a week early for maximum exploitation and then Travis runs away to go play in Nashville while Katie has to recruit her mom to help her take Hailey to the doctor to have her cast removed. Travis makes a video with some YouTube duo named Caleb&Kelsey. It’s a cover of an old hymn but never fear… on the long trip to Jersey, he shares new music that sounds exactly like all of his other music and says it will be released in January. In their weekly vlog Katie is near tears again while talking about her hair, Travis explains that they have a dog sitter and they rerun the video of him and Evan singing at the tree farm. Driving home from NJ Katie tells us that she now has an Oura ring, they have a ski trip in Utah with her family in February, and all of their children will have an H name. They buy Gil 2 pair of shoes, which is definitely NOT a car and head off to the big weekend party. Katie films a party game where her parents are blindfolded and have to guess which child is speaking to them… someone in the crowd yells about 37 grandkids… they currently have 35 and one on the way… 2025 will definitely include a move for these 2…. Will Travis become a Dove Award winner? Will they offer their children the slightest bit of privacy?

3. Josie Balka is determined to be the bougiest Bates. Days before Christmas, she flies to NYC with friends and coworkers to pose and model at all of the hotspots, including MOMA, the Rockettes and Lion King on Broadway. The pool noodle is featured heavily and her friends are merely accessories. Back at home, Josie gets back to exploiting her children by taking them to Target and filming as they choose wrapping paper. Other shoppers are staring and stopped in their tracks…but Josie films anyway. Kelton shows off a ginormous 7 rib roast he was gifted by the guys at work. He preps and grills it for Christmas dinner. Shortly after Christmas Josie says they are all sick, except for Kelton, who of course is catering to them all hand and foot and made homemade chicken (pool?)noodle soup. They have to miss the big birthday getaway but the Effortless Shop continues to churn out hair curling content. 2025 should be the year the Balkas move into their secret McMansion in the country… will Josie eek another year out of the curler empire? Will the girls be filmed from the back only??

4. The original gangster, Alyssa Webster, returned to IG after almost 3 weeks of barely posting…& she came to slay. There was coffee content, doughnut content and deserted parks galore. We also saw garage workouts and heavily filtered cartoon children with disappearing noses… she really rolled out all of the greatest hits. Momma got a Hydrojug sponsorship and she promotes it disguised as a Q and A where she tells us all about her new hair which is bleached blonde, fried and frizzled with cow-lick bangs that she probably already regrets. The filter she uses is warped and she has never seemed more dated in her holey jeans. After all of the coffee content, she has a girls night at a coffee shop. A Christmas miracle seems to have happened and with no promotion at all, her sad hat shop has one less child sized hat, and one less adult sized hat. We don’t know if she actually sold two hats, or if John and Rhett just needed new ones. The weekly vlog shows baby Rhett with a mouth injury. Alyssa says he fell from a table… The cut is inside of his mouth and outside of his mouth, but they decide not to take him to a doctor. Instead, Alyssa allows him to open a Christmas present early while the girls have to watch. The Webster’s Christmas tree is full of gifts… Three times as many as usual. Alyssa says she went overboard with Christmas this year because the girls are getting bigger and they were very good girls this year. I think it is to make up for all of the gifts they will not be getting from the Bates family. Everything is wrapped in boring brown paper. They drop their Christmas special on YouTube and it shows the family in matching pajamas while Alyssa rules over them like a drill sergeant. They have to draw numbers this year and sit in a line to open gifts. The girls are beside themselves to have real gifts instead of shoes and Dollar Tree junk. Allie receives a Critter Corner dollhouse and figures and Maci receives a mermaid dollhouse. The middle two girls have to share a dollhouse and accessories. The gifts are nowhere near even and King Rhett has about 10  different things to open. Lurch is clueless about any of the gifts and has no idea what anything is. Several of the gifts are travel friendly and Alyssa mentions using them on the plane and for travel. Back during her 30th birthday Q and A she said she was contemplating possibly going to Tennessee for her dad‘s 60th birthday… At the time she said she was thinking about it. Could that be the plane ride she is speaking of? Post Christmas, Alyssa features a picture of she and John wearing Tennessee shirts… The music behind the picture is a bluegrass song talking about missing my Tennessee home. Obviously Alyssa is trolling… The speculation about her attendance at her dad‘s 60th birthday is the most excitement she has generated in quite some time. The party weekend comes and goes and no Websters are spotted. Will she fly in when everyone else goes home? Will she stop by on her way to Washington DC for her father-in-law‘s swearing in? In 2025 will we discover WHO Alyssa is angry with? Will she finally land a coffee partnership? Will her children be allowed out of the house?

5. Zach and Whitney Bates celebrated their 11th wedding anniversary with a night out on the town. Whitney wears the boutiques clothes for the date and remains the main one focused on the business. Zach films a reel cooking another steak meal with Bradley and I am convinced they own stock in a cattle farm. Zach invites Michael on for an episode of the Bates Kitchen. He watches while she makes a skillet cobbler with Kaci and Khloe. She has made this hundreds of times growing up. Zach eeks out a second episode with Michael featuring a question and answer session where they talk about their childhood. Michael says cooking was one of the chore choices and she always chose it and Zach gives her credit for raising babies and doing the majority of the cooking. Zach and Whitney take their kids to Dollywood with their new influencer friends and the Stew Crew. Christmas night, Whitney is the first to begin posting links again. They pack up and head out for Gil‘s 60th birthday and on the way Zach tells us that their dog Scout always stays with a dog trainer/border when they travel. Whitney shares pictures of the baby with the dog. It’s a great proof of life that Scout is alive and well, and probably proof that they live in this Sub. At the resort, we see Zach four wheeling with his kids and grilling. They gift his dad a Blackstone grill for his birthday and Zach says he will give Gil a tutorial. Will 2025 bring Zach a Food Network contract? Will Whitney manage to chug down even more powdered supplements? Will their kids continue to be exploited for the almighty dollar??

6. Erin Paine managed to escape from her beef fat manufacturing long enough to beg the Internet to give her a hammered dulcimer for her kid’s Christmas… Let that sentence sink in… She also happily promoted Lawson‘s Cowboy Christmas song by saying her children had listened to it on repeat. Once Erin sold all of her beef fat moisturizer, she had enough money to rent a moving truck, and suddenly their plans to spend Christmas in Florida changed, and packing quickly commenced. Isaiah and Addee showed up to help pack, along with some Florida friends and that allowed Erin to sit on the couch and film it all. Erin celebrates her best friend and sister Tori’s birthday and she is absolutely giddy to report that they are heading to a cabin in the Smoky mountains to celebrate Christmas with Tori and her family. I guess Bobby is OK with the Paines constantly crashing his vacation. Erin tells us that they have finally found a home, but they will not be moving in until after the holidays and celebrating her dad‘s birthday. Erin happily shows off her Oura ring along with her homemade gifts from her children and the huge beef tenderloin they have for Christmas dinner. Erin manages to keep several siblings between her and Carlin all weekend while celebrating her dad‘s birthday. 2025 could see the Paine family drop the doodles and become full time beef fat forgers. Will they stay consistent on YouTube for a check? Will Carson/Charles(Carles) begin to smile again?

7. Lydia Bates decided to make over her bedroom and changed her white bed to… a different white bed. Trace insists on shaving off baby Ryker‘s hair and Lydia does not seem happy about it. Their Vlog is sponsored by Barbers United and Ryker ends up with the same haircut as every other fundie man. They promise to show their families reactions of their birth announcement, but wind up with just a few seconds of reaction… Trace tells us they lost the other footage, but to trust him that everyone was so excited…rookie mistake Trace. Trace and Lydia head to the farm in South Carolina for Christmas and they are the only married couple there. JebJud and Callie squeeze into the backseat for the ride. We see aunt Jenny‘s Christmas party and cookie decorating contest. Lydia and Trace seem to be very close with the extended family and don’t miss many get togethers.  They head back home for Gil‘s 60th birthday party. In 2025 we know a new baby will arrive… will they move? Will Trace actually work construction jobs or will Ryker continue to be the main provider?

8. Michael and Brandon feature the Balka girls making cookies while they discuss Christmas memories. Tori’s kids pop up for a craft and one of them is wearing Alyssa’s sad hat. Michael helps Zach out by actually competently cooking on film and explains that she and Brandon plan to switch to vlogging in the New Year. At Gil‘s birthday party in the resort Michael plays nanny all weekend, holding babies, watching kids and completing crafts. Her siblings all praise her. What will 2025 bring for the Keilens? Will we find out about Brandon’s mystery job? Will Michael up her babysitter fees? Will they continue to exploit their nieces and nephews for views? 

9. Lawson and Tiffany continue their California trip with lots of eating out, tea parties and placing baby Will in odd places like under the Christmas tree. Lawson debuts a music video for his cringey Cowboy Christmas song. Tiffany shows off her dad‘s antique airplane and continuously shows Lawson and the baby in bed shirtless. After several weeks, they have a new YouTube Vlog which shows Lawson in the studio recording Christmas music while Tiffany attempts to handle the baby alone. Apparently it is too much for her to handle because they show up for day two in the studio with a babysitter. Tiffany sings Silent Night and all of the comments are praising her while Lawson‘s talents bring… Crickets. Out of all of the Christmas songs, he only releases his fever dream and Tiffy’s remains buried. Maybe next year! Mysteriously their YouTube vlogs that have been out for months have over 100,000 views… They are receiving pretty good money from YouTube at this point. Tiffy posts several reels reminding everyone that last Christmas no one knew she was pregnant… Is that a hint? Lawson and Tiffany leave California and make it to Tennessee in time for Gil’s 60th birthday party… Tiffany shares nothing from the party but does share pictures of her family with baby Will on the beach. Lawson shares pictures of baby Will with Jane and Bill who are in town for the party. 2025 could be the year these 2 fully move to California… will they show us Duke again? Will Lawson learn to hold his child? Will Tiffy finally be accepted by the Bates sisters?

10.Kelly was busy wishing happy birthday to Tori, happy anniversary to Zach and Whitney and Bobby and Tori as well as celebrating her own anniversary. Gil did absolutely nothing special for the day and Kelly shows them at home eating lasagna made by Michael. There is now a big screen TV on the wall of the big house… Times are definitely changing. Proving that she is becoming a full on influencer, Kelly featured the Bates Sisters Boutique lounge sets for a mere $80 apiece. She also tagged the resort that comped them the cabins for Gil’s 60th birthday. We see pictures and videos of Kelly and Gil with the younger children at the farm for Christmas. Almost all of the children praise her for the huge display of gifts she gave everyone. Who knows where Kelly is getting her money from these days… but they certainly don’t mention Gil in the praises. In the new year will KJ continue her glow up? Will she become a full on content creator? Will she trade in the dang denim skirt??

Happy New Year friends…. Here’s wishing you all a prosperous 2025!",https://www.reddit.com/r/BringingUpBates/comments/1hpl3xb/breaking_down_bates/,dixcgirl10,2024-12-30 16:16:09,221,BringingUpBates

I've been working on a Cricket Manager game for the last 7 years,"This got a lot of attention on /r/Cricket so I thought it might be worth posting here too :-)

[Wicket Cricket Manager](https://playwicketcricket.com/) has been my passion project since 2016 and I figure it is time to finally share it with this community. The game is available on both the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playt20manager&referrer=utm_source%3Dreddit%26utm_medium%3Daa) (it has been for a while!) and for pre-order on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1608850803?pt=565614&ct=red-india&mt=8).

This is a cricket management game, similar to Football Manager, where you take charge of every aspect of your cricket club - from finances to signing players and sponsorships, to upgrading your stadium and training facilities. The game starts you off in the lowest division of your preferred league with the goal of winning matches and getting promoted to the top division. Along the way, you'll get detailed statistics, a chance to reminisce about retired club legends, and take part in regular daily and weekend tournaments etc.

Anyhow, I'm always looking for ways to make the game better and have a list of ideas on the [roadmap](https://playwicketcricket.com/roadmap). I'd love any feedback if you're willing to try it out!",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianGaming/comments/10dd462/ive_been_working_on_a_cricket_manager_game_for/,playwicketcricket,2023-01-16 17:16:48,193,IndianGaming
Sponsorship and the right market: Indian cricket,"With all this talk about sponsorship in the wake of Doge's NASCAR success, we should look to the major growth markets of Bitcoin. 

* [10% of Reddit users are in India](http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/reddit.com)(!), 
* A [new exchange](http://btcxindia.com)* just opened there
* Remittances is [4% of the Indian GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remittances_to_India), or $70 billion annually 
* There is huge potential in tourism. 

If /r/bitcoin is going to sponsor something, it should be something that appeals to these potential users.

How about sponsoring cricket?

Pakistan Cricket Rewind 2024,"It is that time of the year again, and I'm cutting it pretty close this time with 2 hours to go until New Years as I type this.

Our love-hate, or hate-hate, relationship with this team is bordering onto Stockholm syndrome, but we are stuck here for the ride as the train keeps chugging along.

It felt like a bit less wild stuff happened this year, but if you remember something I forgot please do not hesitate to leave a comment. Pakistan cricket ends this year on a high with a question mark. The ODI team is clicking at the perfect time and we've found out how to win tests at home. The next couple months will be very interesting to say the least.

As always I like to give a shout out of sorts at the end of these. It started with shouting out Pakistan cricket Redditors, but the number has grown so exponentially that it's no longer feasible. I would like to shoutout the Pakistani fans who stick through it. You are no fairweather fans who leave and come back when the going is good, you hate yourselves enough to stick through the worst of the worst. You know who you are and I salute you for that. As I said last year, one day we will be led to the glowing promised land as both a country and a team, and having gone through these years and years of harsh patches, the warm radiance of that light will be all the more warming InshAllah.

"Franchising Valorant in the way that they're planning too, it might kill the games progress made so far.","Now I'd like to start by saying that I am from the UK, I have grown up watching the Premier League amongst other traditional team sports such as Cricket, rugby etc. (This is not a post bashing your sports, I actually enjoy alot of the actual sports its the way its implemented that irks me)

  And whilst our system is by no means perfect, I would absolutely loathe most sports if it mirrored the typical franchised American league system.  In this hopefully short-as-possible post, I'd like to outline what I like/dont like about American league format, and the contrast between the two different types of format.  And i'd also like to add a very skeletal version of a system I think could work in valorant, which support grassroots talent, at the same time as providing foundations for top teams to stay at the top *SHOULD THEY DESERVE IT*, and providing a seguey for lesser known teams/orgs to have a crack at playing in a league with the big boys.


Now I would like to start by saying what I do like about American sport.  Ironically for such a capitalist-driven mindset that most Americans have embodied into them, I actually find that the system of having everyone putting in an equal amount to get an equal amount back per year, is actually pretty socialist, and pretty cool.  Yes, of course some teams are just bigger, and will earn more organically just through merchandise, will have different sponsorship deals worth different amounts, slice of the TV viewership pie, but the baseline amount of money is equal, it will always be a safety net for a club to have, as protection, and I really like that. This is also similar to another thing which I like, which is the draft, I like that the chance of getting good young talent is shared out by getting to pick, I really like that as it is again, another pretty socialist idea and is as fair as I could possibly think, think picking people to play for your team in school, 1 at a time, its as close as it can be to fair.

I also like the salary cap, with only a certain amount of players being able to break the wage structure, which in turn, keeps it as fair as it can be whilst still allowing the chance to sign blockbuster players and difference makers.  We have seen the issues in our leagues with clubs with less funds trying to compete with teams who have CRAZY disproportionate levels of wages, and end up going under, clubs that have existed for almost 150 years, liquidating and having to cease to exist- when shit hits the fan, for example when covid happened and they could not make any revenue to fund the wages, its very sad.

But I would say that is where the positives stop in my opinion. Because whenever I look or hear about American leagues, the shit teams, STAY shit, and they do for a long time it feels like.  And sure, you're going to get the odd team, playing out their minds, getting to play-offs or whatever and making a really good run, but you don't often hear about these stories in American sports, certainly not over here anyways, perhaps understandably. 

But its because, There is no JEOPARDY in American sports.

And there really isn't.  As a team, you may have the best intentions of having a strong start to a season, or a split or whatever, but if you have a horrible start to the season and lose the first 6 games its like, ""Oh well we can just try again next time,"" and I just really dislike that.  The fact that you cannot get relegated just makes its so stale I think, the idea to just try again next time, is just SO anti-competitive, breeds complacency, and honestly is just wasting the time of people who wanna pay to support their team.  Plus you just become a scratching post for the teams that are actually winning games, its like stat padding for alot of these teams and its just, personally, not what I wanna see from a sport.

I think you could take elements of both and have a really healthy t1 scene, and a really solid pathway for smaller orgs to get on the map.  Because just gatekeeping small orgs and good players and pigeon-holing them into -lets say- 24 teams, isn't going to give you a huge sample size of the best of the best when it comes to finding new talent.  

Yes, you have academy teams, but I dislike that idea. Trying to have this underlying league thats not even t1 or t2 but is supposed to be something to watch is a bit weird imo, let's just have them in lesser teams, in a league system where if you're good enough you get promoted, or if you're terrible you need to go down. You want to take these players and pitch them against the best, thats how they become a top top player, by slotting them in and saying go on then, let's see if you're good enough.  Not putting them against other players that are really good, but not top level yet, alot of academy players just get sold on, which I guess is a good business model, but its not a good competitive model.


I personally would have 3 seperate league tables; put say 20 teams in the first 2 leagues, and 24 in the 3rd one.

Top 4 teams of each regions #1 league table, go to worlds. 

Bottom 2 of the 1st league get replaced with the top two of the 2nd league.

18th of the first league has to play 3rd place of the second league. 17th has to play 4th of the second league, winner stays in the division.

Same idea with the 2nd to 3rd league with who goes up and down.

And then in the third league, the bottom 4 are relegated into an open tournament of 256 teams, guaranteed a spot in the tournament which would be open to smaller orgs, orgless teams etc. And if they get eliminated, then they will have to wait till the next open quals.

Semi finalists get into the league, then its all about winning that and having a final, for the open quals, this competition could run around the off season, just like worlds.

All in all I just think providing a way for smaller teams to get in and lesser known players to showcase themselves.  As well as having a way to keep the ""elite"" leagues teams on their toes and ensure they always have a reason to try to win EVERY game, is the best way to go.

"I've deciphered the architect of England's test batting problems over the last few years, its an inside job after all.","Its that bat, that bloody **New Balance** bat. That bat is everything that has brought destruction upon England and only Ben Stokes and Joe Root to some degree have been able to wield it but at what cost?

  
Joe Root was a truly exceptional player when he was shooting it down with the Gunn and Moore bat and since he's switched to the New Balance bat, his batting form in test cricket has gone down. 

Gary Ballance started off beautifully before he switched to NB, understandably, with them sharing a name, the sponsorship was inevitable but then the synergy happened and he couldn't swat a fly with his bat. 

Remember World Class number 3 Jonathan Trott? He. was the best number 3 in the world with Gunn and Moore and that soon went to shit when he switched to New Balance and couldn't cope with cricket. 

Rory Burns looks like there will be a ball where he won't be able to get his bat down from god knows where he holds it like its the Stormbreaker. And of course he uses NB. 

Jason Roy in test cricket? Let's not talk about it. At least not as an opener. 

Only Ben Stokes has been consistently able to wield the cursed New Balance bat and even he’s moved away from it to GM for the good of England cricket and suddenly found world class form, it takes too much collateral per performance, bring back the days where the bats were evenly split from GM, GN, V and Adidas, that's the problem. 

The bloody bat is cursed and we need to lodge an investigation into it. 

  
Cheers lads

*“We will not allow a repeat of Kingfisher”* - Ashok Raju, Civil Aviation Minister, commenting on the airliner that collapsed under the weight of ₹9,000 crore of debt. Except we already have another Kingfisher. With a debt-burden of over ₹51,000 crore, we just call it Air India.

**WANTED: RBI Governor**

Alright, you knew this was coming. You don’t live under a rock. You’ve heard about this. We have had wall to wall coverage of this story since it broke. And as the most important economic story of the week, it has to be talked about here. RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan does not [want](http://in.reuters.com/article/rbi-chief-rajan-quit-idINKCN0Z50N2) a second term. In a message to the RBI staff that was released on the central bank’s website, Rajan has stated his desire to not continue as the governor. Instead, he’s going back to his old teaching job in the US. Apparently, the governor was very much interested in serving a second term. But getting reappointed would mean that he would have to maneuver the delicate political minefield. And Rajan was unwilling to get down and dirty in the intricate interlockings of Indian politics, which has now become more complex than the plot of Game of Thrones. And so, the House of Rajan will now be leaving the show in September. This decision to not continue marks a political victory for the campaign against his reappointment, which was led by Subramanium from the House of Swamy. 


**Flying Higher**

Rule 4/20 is the rule that states you must smoke a little something when the clock strikes 4:20. Rule 5/20 is not as exciting or fun, and only applies to the Indian aviation industry. The 5/20 rule states that any Indian airliner must have 5 years of experience flying domestic routes and must own 20 aircrafts before it can operate any international routes. It might sound like redundant regulation to you, but that’s not how the folks at Jet Airways and SpiceJet see this. To incumbent airliners who already satisfy the rule, this is hugely beneficial since it removes competition on international routes. But to newer airliners like Air Asia who don’t satisfy the rule, this is a lost business opportunity. But a new civil aviation policy approved last week [removed](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-airlines-rules-idINKCN0Z110J) the 5-year experience requirement, however the 20 aircraft rule still stands, making it the 0/20 rule. A big round of FDI reforms has also eased rules for FDI in the aviation industry.

**EU & Britain - The Big Divorce**

Britain, the real reason why Indians love tea and cricket, is going through a messy divorce. In a nation-wide referendum, Britishers will soon vote if they want the country to leave the European Union or stay in the European Union. A popular argument for staying in the EU cites the disastrous effects that the British economy is expected to experience if it leaves. The UK Treasury [says](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/portfolio/macro-view/talking-point-brexit-and-indian-markets/article8748796.ece) that if Britain leaves, inflation will spike, unemployment will rise, and GDP growth might be 6% lower. But let’s be honest, most of you can’t be bothered to keep up with even the Indian economy. The news is boring, uninteresting, mundane and all the other synonyms of boring. And here is a story asking you to care about the British economy. So before you tune out, know that you should care about this because the global economy is a series of dominos, and one of them might fall next week. Most of the world is urging Britain to stay in the EU. But really, the only evidence that anyone needs to take into consideration is - Donald Trump supports Britain leaving the EU. And that right there, should be enough information for the British people to know which way to vote.

**STILL WANTED: RBI Governor**

You know what? We haven’t talked about this enough. This story deserves another look. The big news of Rajan’s departure was dropped in an open letter that Rajan wrote to the RBI staff. And it caught everyone off-guard, including the government. While Rajan gets ready for his exit interview, the government is busy looking at résumés of candidates to fill his position. The news of his departure isn’t even a week old, but the race to replace him is already starting to heat up. The shortlist has as many as [seven](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/seven-names-on-long-list-to-replace-rbis-rajan-official-1420762) people, but the frontrunner right now is Arundhati Bhattacharya, a high-profile banker who has been at the helm of India's largest lender - State Bank of India. If you think you can make the shortlist, send your CV to: Sansad Marg, Janpath, New Delhi, Delhi 110001. Either way, get ready to bid farewell to Rajan. It sure was good while it lasted, wasn’t it? But like all good things in life, it had to come to an end. Rajan, we had a lot of fun together, didn’t we? Remember when you cut consumer inflation from a high of 11.16% to a low of 3.69%? Yeah.. Good times. And remember when you increased the foreign exchange reserves from $275 billion to $363 billion? Yeah... Those were the days. I’m sorry, I think I need some time alone.

* To stop cheap imports of foreign wheat from messing with the domestic wheat market which employs a lot of farmers, the government levies a duty of 25% on all wheat imports. Last week, the duty which was set to expire this month was [renewed](http://www.deccanchronicle.com/business/in-other-news/180616/india-extends-25-percent-tax-on-wheat-imports-ram-vilas-paswan.html) for 3 more months. But it might not work as planned. Despite being the world’s 2nd largest producer of wheat, Indian imports of wheat could touch a decade-high this year. Well, at least the government will make a ton of cash off it.

* Technically, Amazon India is not an e-commerce company. It is an online marketplace [that](http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/amazon-continues-to-lobby-for-hybrid-ecommerce-model-in-india-116061300365_1.html) connects buyers and sellers. E-commerce is when you sell inventory directly to the buyer. Current regulations don’t allow FDI in e-commerce, which means foreign companies like Amazon can’t enter the e-commerce industry. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos recently met PM Modi and lobbied him to allow FDI in e-commerce. One can only imagine how frustrated Bezos must’ve felt when they told him that last week, India [eased](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/govt-to-hold-briefing-on-fdi-rules-today/article8751887.ece) FDI rules for 9 industries including aviation, defense, pharma and food processing. Can you guess which industry didn’t make the cut?

* Larsen & Toubro has [bagged](http://in.reuters.com/article/soccer-worldcup-qatar-idINKCN0YS0P2) a $135 million contract to build a stadium in Qatar for the FIFA 2022 World Cup. $135 million is a lot of money. Qatar’s economy is largely based on oil and prices are not exactly ideal right now. So if you’re wondering how they are even paying for the stadium, wonder no more - The Gulf country has cut planned spending on building hospitals by about two-thirds in 2016 following the drop in oil prices to keep expenditure on its World Cup-related projects unchanged. Those are some solid priorities right there.

* It hasn’t even been a week since the news of Rajan’s departure broke and bad news has already [started](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/wpi-inflation-rises-to-079-in-may-on-higher-food-prices/article8727957.ece) rolling in. Consumer inflation, which halved during Rajan’s tenure, came in at a 21-month high of 5.76% for the month of May. Food prices for the month went up by 7.55%, also a 21-month high. Wholesale inflation, which was negative until two months ago, came in at a 19-month high of 0.76%. RAJAN. THERE IS STILL TIME. PLEASE DON’T LEAVE ME.

They say there aren’t any free lunches in the world. But at least you don’t get the bill after a free lunch. However, that might soon change.

Iceland Cricket Sponsorship (Voting Thread),"Thanks for posting your nominations for the slogan that should be printed on the official kit of Iceland Cricket.

We received around 100 different nominations but they had to be trimmed down since some of them were against the guidelines posted in the nominations thread, while some of them were too similar to other slogans which conveyed the message better.

Also, some nominations haven't made the final cut as the Icelandic Cricket Board were worried that the memes are too niche and wouldn't make sense to people outside the sub. They didn't ask us to remove those nominations, but I feel it would be in everyone's best interests if we ignore those nominations for now.

Here's their message:

>Iceland Cricket has been given the opportunity to veto any of the nominations. Iceland is a very fair and democratic country. We don’t want to you to remove any of the nominations. We don’t want to accept your community’s money and then start making demands. We are hugely grateful for the generosity and spirit shown by everyone at r/Cricket. We feel that maybe wearing a slogan based on an r/Cricket in-joke might not be the best idea - funny to begin with but then the general public would not get the reference and the joke might soon wear thin, especially after two years - and we’d prefer not to wear #ExpandTheWorldCup and antagonise the ICC but these are just our feelings. r/Cricket is an open forum and an egalitarian space and we love it - and you - for that. So we’ll wear what you want us to wear. Our favourites are the general ones that convey a positive message about cricket to the widest possible audience. But it’s totally up to you.

We should also keep in mind the [original idea of this campaign.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/8bpfos/donate_to_the_iceland_cricket_team_and_become/)

South Asian Genetic Advantages w/ Extensive Scientific Evidence PART 1: (Largest Collection of Different South Asian Genetic Advantages + Debunking Numerous Myths & Stereotypes About South Asians),"PART 2 HERE:
https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthAsianMasculinity/comments/wwspv9/south_asian_genetic_advantages_w_extensive/

Please read both posts in full. I know they're very long, but they're worth it. And it won't take you more than 20-30 minutes to read both. Trust me. You will learn a LOT, and I guarantee you will look at life, and your racial identity very differently.

Plus, if you've been a victim of racism from western fitness myths and stereotypes, I guarantee you will feel a renewed sense of empowerment and pride by the end. I have also likely went over any questions, arguments, or concerns you may have.

Also, don't just skip to the genetic advantages post. This myth/stereotype debunking post contains a lot of South Asian genetic advantages as well.

**DISCLAIMER**
This post is only in response to the pseudo-scientific racism against South Asians in Western fitness culture. I am not claiming that South Asians are genetically superior. I am only highlighting multiple different genetic advantages that South Asians have, which I feel the need to do because of the rampant racism against us in the western fitness community. There are so many people online who keep saying that South Asians have bad genetics and making false claims like ""South Asians can't build muscle"", ""South Asians are weak and unathletic"", ""South Asians have low testosterone"", etc etc. (All of which I will be debunking with peer reviewed scientific evidence) There are many instances of people, including fitness influencers, who say this. For example, if you look up ""South Asian genetics"" or ""South Asian bodybuilding genetics"" on Google and YouTube, you'll see a bunch of videos and blogs/articles claiming South Asians have bad genetics for bodybuilding/athleticism. Which is extremely problematic because if left unchecked these racists will influence many South Asians and non South Asians into falsely believing that South Asians have bad genetics. I have seen too many of our South Asian brothers and sisters falling for these myths. I had myself. It's a terrible feeling. To think that you have bad genes, to hear all these people tell you that you are genetically inferior. Just imagine what impact this can have on our brown youth. Fortunately this racism led me down a rabbit hole of extensive research in which I found a multitude of different genetic advantages South Asians possess. Today I will be sharing this empowering information with you.

**DISCLAIMER 2**
Genetic differences between ethnicities work ON AVERAGES. This is what people mean when they say ""race is a social construct"" (To which I both agree and disagree) Human races are also very diverse within themselves. For example, South Asians and East Africans on average have a more stamina/endurance oriented physiology and genetic profile, as opposed to West Africans and Europeans who have a more strength/power oriented physiology and genetic profile. And at the same time there are many specific South Asian and East African ethnic groups who are better at strength than most West Africans and Europeans. In the same way that there are many West African and European ethnic groups who are better at endurance than most South Asians and East Africans.

**DISCLAIMER 3**
Every ethnic group has a myriad of genetic advantages and disadvantages on average. No one group is superior or inferior.

With that being said, let's proceed. This collection of information will be divided into 2 parts. This is part 1. Part 2 is linked at the top and bottom.

This first post will focus on debunking the racist western fitness myths and stereotypes about South Asian genetics. The second section will focus on highlighting the different genetic advantages South Asians possess.

DO NOT SKIP ANY SECTIONS, IF YOU DO SO YOU WILL BE MISSING OUT ON A LOT OF IMPORTANT KNOWLEDGE

# PART 1 - DEBUNKING RACIST WESTERN FITNESS MYTHS AND STEREOTYPES

**MYTH NUMBER 1: SOUTH ASIANS HAVE BAD GENETICS FOR BODYBUILDING**

- This is one of the most prevalent myths. If you look up ""South Asian Genetics"" on YouTube, the first result will be Team3dalphas video on why South Asians struggle to build muscle. It has nearly 100k views. Along with many other videos from many other content creators claiming that South Asians struggle with bodybuilding. Just imagine how many brown youth have seen these videos and believed that they are genetically inferior. As if we didn't already have enough self hate issues in our community.

What's crazy is that none of these videos provide any scientific evidence for their claims. They look at nerdy-vegetarian-protein deficient-never worked out a day in their life-doctor-computer-engineer Indian American immigrants, and stereotype 2 billion people based off them.

**THERE IS LITERALLY ZERO EVIDENCE SHOWING THAT SOUTH ASIANS STRUGGLE TO BUILD MUSCLE.**

**In fact, all scientific evidence shows the COMPLETE OPPOSITE. There are several studies which examine the South Asian response to exercise. And every single one of them shows that South Asians actually build muscle at an elevated rate.**

Overall there is no significant between ethnicities when it comes to bodybuilding. But if you look at the data it shows that South Asians (compared with Caucasians) build muscle slightly faster but lose fat slightly slower. Don't know about you, but I'm happy with that.

LINKS TO PEER REVIEWED STUDIES MEASURING RESPONSE TO PHYSICAL EXERCISE IN SOUTH ASIANS AND EUROPEANS:

https://www.physoc.org/abstracts/a-comparison-of-the-effects-of-resistance-exercise-training-on-muscle-mass-and-function-in-south-asians-and-white-europeans/

Here the raw data displays muscle mass gained between ethnicities is South Asians: baseline 12.73±1.12 Litres to 13.19±1.23 Litres at 12 weeks and White Europeans: baseline 13.00±1.02 Litres to 13.23±0.92 Litres at 12 weeks.In this study period from start to finish South Asians gained around 0.46 Litres of muscle, Europeans gained around 0.23.

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-06446-7/figures/1

See Figure 1 in this study, it again shows that South Asians built more muscle at a faster rate. But lost less fat at a slower rate. Overall it was not a significant difference either way.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6419981/

This study displays equivalent cardio-metabolic responses to exercise between the two groups, as opposed to another study which showed a difference. It depends on several diet and lifestyle factors.

As you can see there is little difference between the two ethnicities in their response to resistance training.

South Asians do have a slightly elevated muscle building response, but on the flipside a slightly slower fat loss response. (Some have argued that the South Asians in the study were beginners in the gym and experienced ""newbie gains"", this is not true. The researchers have accounted for that as the studies controlled for baseline physical activity levels, along with diet and other lifestyle factors. See Table 1 and Table 2. Others have argued that the South Asians were younger than the White Europeans so they built muscle faster, this is also false. The South Asians in the first study were younger, but in the second study the South Asians were older. There was not a significant age difference between the two groups. And again the researchers accounted for that, as shown in the tables there were no differences in age related factors that would influence response to exercise.)

**So in conclusion South Asians on build muscle faster than average, but lose fat slower than average. That's a fair tradeoff in my opinion.**

# MYTH NUMBER 2: SOUTH ASIANS ARE BAD AT SPORTS/SOUTH ASIANS HAVE BAD GENETICS FOR ATHLETICISM

- South Asian countries today perform poorly in most sports. This is one of the main reasons why people then use that to assess our genetics, and come to the conclusion that since modern day South Asian professional athletes are uncommon, that must mean that South Asians have bad genetics for athleticism.

If South Asian countries did well in sports, there would not really be much discourse on whether our genetics are bad or not.

**But the thing is, we used to do very well in sports relatively recently.**

In the 1900s India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka used to consistently dominate in Olympic Field Hockey, Wrestling, and various other sports. We would regularly beat countries like America, the Netherlands, Spain, Mexico, Japan, Australia, Germany, and more. Countries which were known for their prowess in the Olympics. Here is a quick history on Indian Olympic gold medal wins in the 1900s. https://olympics.com/en/featured-news/india-olympics-medals

And here is a history of wrestling in India and in the Olympicshttps://olympics.com/en/news/indian-wrestling-history-legacy-olympics-medals-world-championships

Here's a quote from the article:

""More success followed at the 1970 Commonwealth Games in Edinburg, Scotland. India won five golds, three silvers and one bronze medal across weight categories to emerge as the most successful wrestling team in that edition.Indian wrestlers consistently won medals at the Asian Games since 1954, with the first Asiad gold coming in 1962. Maruti Mane, Ganpat Andhalkar and Malwa Singh won in different categories.India’s wrestling pedigree continued its upsurge with Kartar Singh, Rajender Singh and Satpal Singh all winning medals at the Asian and Commonwealth Games until 1986.The retirement of the prominent generation of grapplers, though, pushed Indian wrestling on the backfoot. Over the next two decades, the country barely made an impression on the international arena.""

There are also world famous South Asian athletes that are considered the greatest of all time. Such as the undefeated Great Gama, who is widely regarded as the best wrestler in history. He traveled the globe and would publicly issue challenges to any world wrestling champions to a match. He beat every single one.

Dhyan Chand who was so ridiculously good at field hockey that officials broke his hockey sticks to inspect them for magnets. He was so good that he impressed Hitler enough for him to ask Chand to become a German citizen and offer him a high ranking position in the Nazi forces. An offer which Dhyan Chad, I mean, Chand* refused.

Mohammed Salim AKA ""The Indian Juggler"" was widely regarded one of the greatest football players in the world during the 1930s. He and the teams he played for consistently dominated football games in that era. ""Indian nationalists were fighting for independence from British colonial rule during the 1920s and 1930s. Many Indians took to football to answer British jibes that Indians were incapable of home rule. They played in bare feet and managed to defeat British teams wearing boots which was seen as evidence that Indians were in no way inferior.[8]""

Here are Indian bodybuilders from 1920s to 30s, years before the invention of steroids. Compare them to other bodybuilders of the pre steroid era (before 1935), the Indian bodybuilders look better. https://www.mensxp.com/amp/health/motivation/95108-kolkata-bodybuilders-1930-bishnucharan-ghosh-began-raj.html

**So what happened? How was South Asia so good at sports during the 1900s, when the levels of poverty, famine, and malnutrition were so much more extreme? The answer, is a combination of culture and government.**

Sometime around the 1960s, Indian culture went through many reforms and radically changed, for the better in some areas, for the worse in others.

Education became an utmost priority and sports careers were disregarded and even frowned upon. To this day dedicating your life to a career in professional sports instead of striving to become a doctor or engineer is a great way to get disowned in many Indian cultures.

Although a select few sports like cricket and kabbadi in certain South Asian populations are very popular. These two sports are the only ones widely appreciated in Indian culture and incidently, South Asia dominates the globe in these sports.

Around this time the government stopped funding sports altogether and prioritized defense budget. This is still the case today.

So the reason for worse sports representation in South Asia is a combination of lack of government and corporate funding, lack of government and corporate financial incentives, very poor sports infrastructure, low access to sports facilities, pursuing a sports career being looked down upon in the culture, one of the highest rates of malnourishment, highest rate of protein deficiency, etc etc.

There are many documentaries on how difficult it is to pursue a sports career in India. It is likely one of the hardest places in the world to become a pro athlete. So wouldn't it make sense that a place like that would not do very well in sports? You'd think that's obvious, but we still see so many ""bro-scientists"" assessing South Asian genetics on nothing more than sports representation. Which is just ridiculous.

DON'T GET ME WRONG, sports representation can be used to assess and compare different ethnicities genetics in certain cases. But only if all else (culture, government, access to opportunity, wealth, participation rates) is equal. For example, there are indeed genetic reasons as to why Black American sprinters perform so much better than any other race American sprinters.

**Here's some good news about sports in South Asia. Over the past few years it has been getting much better.**

- India won 1st place in the IBA youth world boxing championships in 2021, beating Russia and Poland which usually dominate there, and getting 8 gold medals in a single event which is a new boxing world record.- India won the Asia powerlifting championships 2022, and many years before that as well. Sri Lanka has also been doing very well here.- India and Pakistan in the past few years have also been winning or placing top 3 in GAMMA Asia MMA championships, and Asia wrestling championships. Often times beating Iran and Kazakhstan which are known around the world for their prowess in wrestling.- The Indian field hockey team scores the highest in the world in the yoyo physical fitness test. (The Yoyo test is the main test for physical performance in sports) Look up ""Field hockey yoyo test results""- The Commonwealth Games are like the Olympics, highly popular worldwide, almost as big and nearly as competitive as the Olympics- India in the 2022 Commonwealth Games ranked 4th place out of 72 countries.- India ranked 1st place in wrestling at the 2022 Commonwealth Games, Pakistan ranked 4th out of 26 countries in wrestling- Also in the 2022 Commonwealth Games, The wrestling champions in ALL 6 weight categories, every single gold medalist in each category was ethnically South Asian (either representing India, Canada, or the UK)- The current ONE FC Heavyweight WORLD Champion is South Asian (Arjan Bhullar)- The current IBA Middleweight WORLD Champion is South Asian (Sukhdeep Chakria)- The Indian army ranked 1st winning a gold medal at both the 2021 and 2016 Cambrian Patrol in the UK (""Cambrian Patrol organised by the UK Army is considered the ultimate test of human endurance, team spirit and is sometimes referred as the Olympics of Military Patrolling among militaries in the world, a Defence Ministry release said."")- Indian powerlifter Sajeevan Bhaskaran holds the world record for the deadlift in the 52kg category, a record considered in the powerlifting community to be unbreakable.

And it's only gonna get better from here on. Sports careers are becoming more acceptable in our culture. Government funding and corporate sponsorships are slowly but surely starting up. The future is bright for our South Asian athletes.

# MYTH NUMBER 3: SOUTH ASIANS ARE MORE FEMININE/HAVE LOW TESTOSTERONE

- This is a stereotype I've seen directed moreso towards our East Asian brothers (which is also not true) But many believe this to be true for South Asians as well. You have Team3dalpha saying (again without providing any evidence) in his race ranking video that South Asians have low androgenicity.

This is completely false. Again people look at nerdy-vegetarian-protein deficient-never worked out a day in their life-doctor-computer-engineer Indian American immigrants, and stereotype a population of 2 billion as having low testosterone.

**The scientific evidence debunks this myth. It actually suggests that South Asians have one of the highest testosterone levels on earth.**

Yes, there are a few studies showing that South Asians have lower testosterone (there are studies like that for every single ethnicity)

But there are many more studies showing that South Asians have higher testosterone. Many of which I'll be linking shortly.

The reason for this is that while genetics do play a role in testosterone levels, your environment does as well. Depending upon the environment in which you were raised your testosterone can be high or low.

The studies showing that South Asians have low testosterone look at immigrants.

One thing that you have to understand about the South Asian immigration system is that it selects for low testosterone individuals.

Let me explain.

It's usually only the highest academically achieving, hyper education focused individuals that get to immigrate out of South Asia. (With the exception of the Bangladeshi immigrations lottery system) That's why these immigrants and their children perform so well academically and have such high income (And why Bangladeshi immigrants have such low income)

So, pardon my terminology here, for lack of a better phrase, the vast majority of South Asians who immigrate to the West, are ""Nerds""

While the more ordinary run of the mill South Asians rarely have a chance to immigrate, most of them remain in South Asia.

Since testosterone levels are so dependant on your environment, you can see why it's obvious that many first and second generation South Asian westerners will have low testosterone. They were raised in a strict hyper education focused culture which discourages sports/physical activity. (As these descendants of South Asian immigrants become more integrated into western society they will become less like the stereotypical nerdy Indian, and as a result their testosterone levels will increase, as a study shown later in this section reveals that South Asians living in the UK have higher testosterone than ethnic Europeans living in the UK)

This is also the reason why Black Americans have higher testosterone than White Americans. They are much more likely to be raised in a more violent culture. This is proven to increase testosterone levels. Here is a research paper discussing this further - ""Testosterone Is High among Young Black Men with Little Education"" https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsoc.2016.00001/full

In other words if you were raised in the ""hood"", (or any hyper masculine environment) whether you're White, Black, Latino, or an Eskimo hailing from the northern circumpolar region of Eastern Siberia, you will likely have higher testosterone.

Also, a lot of these studies displaying lower testosterone levels in South Asians assess elderly South Asian immigrants, which were born in South Asia during a time where there was even higher malnutrition poverty and bacteria/disease rates than there are today. This also can significantly reduce testosterone as the body prioritizes fighting off harmful bacteria and making sure you don't starve to death over testosterone production.

**TESTOSTERONE PART 2:**

Now that we've addressed the studies which show South Asians having lower testosterone, (which again, there are studies like that for every ethnicity), here are the studies which show South Asians having significantly higher testosterone levels than the Western average.

These next studies are more fair as they examine healthy UK born next generation South Asians, healthy non malnourished Indians from India, and Indo Caribbeans. All of whom are more often ""average Joe's"" as opposed to the ""nerdy"" Indian American immigrants. Therefore it is more fair to compare them with Westerners.

Here is a study showing that South Asians in the UK have higher testosterone levels than UK-born ethnic Europeans.

""Childhood ecology influences salivary testosterone, pubertal age and stature of Bangladeshi UK migrant men""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-018-0567-6

Quote from the study: ""Second-generation Bangladeshis were taller, with higher testosterone than sedentees and adult migrants, and higher waking testosterone than Europeans."" (Waking testosterone is what is used to determine a males testosterone levels, that's why when you want to examine your levels in the lab you are instructed to take the test in the morning)

Here is a study demonstrating that Indo-Caribbeans have the same testosterone levels as Afro-Caribbeans.

""Serum high density lipoprotein subclasses, testosterone and sex-hormone-binding globulin in Trinidadian men of African and Indian descent""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4040371/

Here's a study done on middle aged (38 years old on average) Indian men living in India which shows a very high average testosterone level of 936 ng/dl in the control group which the researchers list as a sample set representing the average Indian male population. The alcoholic group was much lower than the control group with a 577 ng/dl average, which is to be expected from heavy consumption of alcohol. 577 ng/dl is low for healthy Indian males but is average for healthy Western males.

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38105505_Levels_of_plasma_testosterone_antioxidants_and_oxidative_stress_in_alcoholic_patients_attending_de-addiction_centre

Here is another study on elderly Indian men living in India which showcases a relatively high level of testosterone (795 ng/dl) for their age (62 years old on average) This study is also on men with benign prostatic hyperplasia which is associated with lower levels of testosterone, yet they still display above average levels.

https://www.urotoday.com/component/dms/correlation-of-age-prostate-volume-serum-prostate-specific-antigen-and-serum-tes/download.html?Itemid=393

Here is a large global collection of testosterone levels by continent/region. (This is not a study, it is a chart displaying a collection of testosterone studies from different regions of the world. But all sources are listed and can be confirmed)

https://ethnicmuse.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/ethnic-testosterone1.pdf

As you can see the average testosterone levels for South Asians is among the highest in the world with young healthy South Asian males consistently averaging testosterone levels of around 1,000 ng/dl.

# MYTH NUMBER 4:SOUTH ASIANS ARE SICKLY/DISEASE PRONE

**South Asians have one of the lowest, if not the lowest total disease mortality rates. Even among poor South Asians.**

So it's crazy that this myth/stereotype exists, since all the evidence reveals the complete opposite.

Many of you probably haven't heard this myth but I assure you that it exists. Those of you who use tiktok have likely been exposed to it as it has been making rounds in the South Asian community on that app. It is due to a couple of doctors with large followings who post about the specific genetic health risks South Asians face. (Each ethnicity has certain diseases/conditions that they are at a higher risk for)

Let's take Desi Doc on tiktok for example. He has a very large following on tiktok, he has multiple videos on South Asian genetic health risks which have garnered millions of views each.

The comments under these videos are filled with South Asian people grieving that they have bad genetics, South Asian people saying they wish they weren't South Asian, racist non South Asians laughing that South Asians are genetically inferior, and just a bunch of racism and self hate in general.

This is because the way Desi Doc words his videos makes it seem like South Asians are the most disease prone ethnicity, have very bad genetics, and often die or succumb to disease at much higher rates than other ethnicities.

**THIS COULD NOT BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH.**

Yes, South Asians are more prone to diabetes and certain cardiovascular diseases than other ethnicities. But every single ethnicity has its own specific health risks. Europeans are overwhelmingly more likely to get all types of cancer for example. South Asians are not unique in this in any way.

South Asians actually have one of the LOWEST overall disease mortality rates.

Here is a study from the UK showing that despite being most likely to live in deprived neighborhoods and have the lowest income, South Asians (as well as Black Africans) have the lowest overall disease rates and disease FATALITY rates.

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-report-of-the-commission-on-race-and-ethnic-disparities-supporting-research/ethnic-disparities-in-the-major-causes-of-mortality-and-their-risk-factors-by-dr-raghib-ali-et-al

Here is another study showing the same thing.

https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/lifeexpectancies/articles/ethnicdifferencesinlifeexpectancyandmortalityfromselectedcausesinenglandandwales/2011to2014

And here is another study showing the same thing again.

https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/mortalityfromleadingcausesofdeathbyethnicgroupenglandandwales/2012to2019

So it's just crazy to me that this Desi Doc guy has thousands of South Asians on tiktok believing that they are genetically inferior. Just take a look at the comments under any one of his dozens of posts on South Asian genetics. You might wish you hadn't. But it's necessary for all of us to see this stuff and get angry, because that will make you want to take action. Read on till the end of this post to see how you can help combat this misinformation.

Don't get me wrong, Desi Docs heart is in the right place. He's trying to educate our people and advocating for our communities to take fitness and health more seriously. But he is causing a lot of self hate issues and inferiority complexes in the process. I just wish he would word his videos differently, or make a video clarifying that South Asians actually have one of the lowest disease rates.

# MYTH NUMBER 5:SOUTH ASIANS HAVE SMALL PP's 📷

- This is a stereotype that again is moreso directed towards our East Asian brothers, (which is again not true for them either) but South Asians face it too.

There is a popular infographic and dataset that has been going around online for quite some time now. It is fabricated data displaying the average PP size in different countries. You've likely seen it already. If not, just type in average P*n*s size by country. You'll see a bunch of charts, blogs, and articles using this fake data. There are countless different iterations of this data.

The crazy thing is that all this ""evidence"" is a mix of entirely fabricated data (which is used for the Asian countries) and self reported data (which is used for Western and African countries)

The even crazier thing is that the original infographic literally comes from a comedy magazine called Mandatory.com. And it lists no sources.

And the craziest thing is that wherever you see it posted on social media, most people in the comments believe it without question. I was guilty of that myself when I was a kid, I remember being very disappointed to learn that my people have one of the smallest willies. Unfortunately I didn't have any information like this debunking the racist pseudo science that I was exposed to in my younger years. Hopefully this post can help a lot of brown youth feel empowered after being told that they're inferior by racists.

Here's an article that does a wonderful job in debunking this racist misinformation.

https://www.dailydot.com/irl/penis-size-infographic-debunked/?amp

There are also multiple articles claiming that Indian men are too small for international sized condoms. Like this one here https://www.wired.com/2006/12/indian-men-too-/amp

This is based on reports of some Indian men claiming that their condoms keep slipping and breaking.

This is misinformation. Here is an article by Vice in which the Vice employees went around India trying to find a small size condom. They looked all around, but simply could not find any. https://www.vice.com/amp/en/article/vbp8vd/the-quest-for-a-small-condom

This is likely because the demand is very low. A whopping 95% of men in India do NOT even use condoms. https://www.indiatoday.in/amp/india/story/indian-men-have-a-problem-they-hate-condoms-this-is-what-it-results-in-1566806-2019-07-11

In America and all other countries where 95% of the god damn population doesn't use condoms(seriously what's up with that?)

There is much more demand. So all condom sizes from extra small to extra large are available. There's something for everyone, no matter how big you are. So you're not going to be hearing anyone complain about condom size, unlike in India.

So can we really make the claim that Indian men are too small for condoms, because of complaints that condoms are too small?

**Of course not. Especially when the researcher measured data shows Indian men having larger PP sizes than American men.**

Which brings me to my next point.

**SOUTH ASIAN PP SIZE PART 2: THE ACTUAL RESEARCHER MEASURED DATA**

South Asians don't have small willies. We actually have big ones. And I can prove it with science. All of the following studies will contain official researcher measured data in a laboratory setting. No self reported data will be used. Because obviously just asking guys how well endowed they are is a really stupid way to determine their actual sizes.

Here is a study comparing the average erect lengths in Kerala, India with multiple other countries including the USA and Nigeria. The Indian measured erect length was slightly longer than Americans. But not a very significant difference. The Indian cohort was also Non Bone Pressed Erect Length, which is the opposite of most western studies which include bone pressed erect lengths which can add an inch or two to the measurement.

In addition, PP size is correlated with height. The taller you are the larger your hands, feet, and PP will usually be.

And South Asian and African countries have significantly lower average heights due to poverty and malnutrition, but still have equal PP sizes to Western men. So how would a South Asian, African, and Western man of equal height measure up? (Larger sizes in Africa and South Asia could possibly be explained by evolution in a hot climate, which provides longer limbs/extremities as stated by the scientific law Allens Rule)

https://www.nature.com/articles/3901569

Here is the full text of that study in case you don't have access through a college (Scroll down to Table 5 to see comparisons of Indian measured sizes with other countries measured sizes. If you are on mobile click reader view or download the PDF or click print to view the tables and graphs)

https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?p=AONE&u=googlescholar&id=GALE%7CA190101445&v=2.1&it=r&sid=AONE&asid=dbd194fb

Here is the largest measured study on human PP size, a systematic review of over 15,000 men. It revealed that there was ""no indications of differences in racial variability""

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25487360/

In other words, there was no difference in PP sizes between most countries. But there were differences in heights, which is correlated with PP size.

If you'd like to compare sizes here is a great resource. The thing is, it contains both self reported and researcher measured datasets. But fortunately it lists whether they are self reported or not.

Keep in mind that PP sizes can also vary between different studies in the same country. That's just basic statistics. For example if you do two separate studies on the same ethnic group in California, the sizes will likely be different.

This site displays a Google Earth like globe where you can click on a certain country and see measured or self reported sizes. (If a size is not listed as measured, disregard it. For example some self reported sizes listed will be 6.5 inches. No human group in the world *averages* that size.) If you are on mobile the globe may not load at first. Try clicking the search bar at the top right, it loaded the map for me.

https://allsizesmatter.com

These two sites also display both measured and self reported data. Scroll past the first 50 or so countries to see the actual measured data.

https://www.worlddata.info/average-penissize.php

https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/penis-size-by-country

In South Asia the only actual measured sources that are available are from India and Pakistan, as you can see they both have large sizes relative to their height.

**Here are some comparisons of (only researcher measured in a laboratory setting) PP sizes:**

- India MEASURED Size: 5.1 Inches
- America MEASURED Size: 5.1 Inches
- UK MEASURED Size: 5.1 Inches
- Ireland MEASURED Size: 5.0 Inches
- Italy MEASURED Size: 4.9 Inches
- France MEASURED Size: 5.3 Inches
- Congo MEASURED Size: 5.7 Inches (Largest Measured Size)
- Russia MEASURED Size: 5.1 Inches
- Venezuela MEASURED Size: 5.0 Inches
- China MEASURED Size: 5.0 Inches
- Japan MEASURED Size: 5.1 Inches
- Saudi Arabia MEASURED Size: 4.9 Inches
- Iraq MEASURED Size: 5.0 Inches
- Nigeria MEASURED Size: 5.2 Inches
- Tanzania MEASURED Size: 5.1 Inches

**So South Asians (as well as Africans) have the same measured PP sizes as significantly taller Western populations. Since larger height is correlated with larger hand, foot, and PP size, I wonder how the average sizes would look with the newest generation of healthy South Asians, who as of 2022, are taller than wealthy Western Nations. (Evidence provided in Part 2, Advantage 4: South Asian genetic height potential is one of the tallest in the world)**

A new report from e4m now claims that Star India will continue to operate JioCinema for mass content and use Hotstar for premium content after the merger. ,"Here's the article: 

According to sources, Viacom18-Disney Star merger plans two apps—Disney+ Hotstar for premium and JioCinema for mass content segmentation.  

The $8.5 billion merger between Viacom18 and Disney Star is poised to redefine the Indian OTT landscape, but significant internal shifts are also underway. According to sources close to developments, the merged entity plans to go ahead with two distinct apps- a premium platform, likely Disney+ Hotstar, and a freemium service via JioCinema.

Experts suggest that a dual-platform approach aims to streamline content offerings, ensuring a clearer distinction between high-end and mass-market content. This strategy according to them will enhance targeting for advertisers, offering them more precise audience segments while preventing content clutter across the platforms

“A single app with too much content spanning entertainment, sports, and other genres can overwhelm users, making it challenging to navigate and find relevant content. This could lead to higher churn rates if users find the experience cumbersome,” said a media planner. 

According to some media buying and planning experts, premium entertainment audiences and sports enthusiasts often have distinct viewing habits. Merging these into one platform could dilute the user experience for both groups, making it harder to cater effectively to their specific needs.

Sources also indicate that the Disney-Reliance joint venture (JV) will introduce a segmented approach to sports offerings. While a media report previously suggested that all live sporting events under the merged entity, including the Indian Premier League (IPL), will be available, sources clarify this may be only partially accurate. While IPL, a premium property, will stream exclusively on Disney+ Hotstar, the JV plans to categorize sports properties into distinct tiers.

“One tier will house premium events like IPL, FIFA, and other top-tier leagues while the other will feature more regional or mass-appeal events such as the Pro Kabaddi League (PKL). This segregation aims to enhance audience targeting and advertising opportunities, aligning sports properties with appropriate viewer segments across the two platforms,” said sources. 

Elaborating on disadvantages of consolidating premium content and mass content in one app, a media planner said, “A unified app could make it harder to offer segmented advertising opportunities. Premium content and sports operate under different revenue models. While sports may rely heavily on advertising and sponsorships, premium content often focuses on subscriptions. Integrating both models within a single app could complicate pricing strategies and user retention.

As of now, Disney+ Hotstar offers a desi entertainment lineup with series like City of Dreams, and The Night Manager. On the sports front, Hotstar streams cricket events like the ICC Cricket World Cup 2024, along with key bilateral series. 

Meanwhile, JioCinema has carved out a distinct niche by securing the IPL streaming rights, which has been a major draw for its freemium model. Beyond cricket, JioCinema's content library includes global football events like FIFA tournaments and La Liga. Additionally, JioCinema houses HBO content, making it a key player in the entertainment segment by offering popular shows and series, further enhancing its appeal to a broader audience. IPs like Bigg Boss are also major viewership drivers for the platform.

While Disney+ Hotstar declined to comment, a query sent to JioCinema did not receive any response by the time this story was published.

I'm going to give my children whimsical fun names because I believe it's a huge subconscious advantage in life,"I used to work with a guy named Scooter, and I'd see peoples' eyes light up when they merely heard his name. He was just another pmc drone, but everyone had a subconscious positive association with him because his name is Scooter. I don't even think it was his real name. I thought about this a lot.

I noticed this happens in sports, too, which is supposed to be the ultimate meritocracy. But guys with fun names get drafted earlier, ink bigger contacts, become fan favorites, and are more likely to have better sponsorship deals. 

Imagine what a huge advantage it must be for everyone you meet to automatically be in your corner by default.

Yet another thread to continue collating opinion/analysis/discussion pieces about this incident into one place, including the reaction and fallout from the initial investigation findings. Significant new news developments/articles can be posted separately. 

Context: Australian opener Cameron Bancroft was caught using tape to alter the condition of the ball during play. Steve Smith has admitted that the Australian leadership group had planned for this to happen.

Smith, Warner, and Bancroft apparently the only people that knew of the plan. Renshaw, Burns, and Maxwell will replace the trio in the squad. Lehmann will remain as coach. Tim Paine officially endorsed as Australian test captain. 

**Important:**

Please remember rule 6. Attacks/flamebait directed at Australian fans will result in bans. The team rightly deserves to cop whatever heat is coming to them, but that's not an excuse to abuse fans that are suffering and outraged too.

"Why we need cricket to fail, and fail big","*I have engaged in this discussion more times than I care to remember – by most estimates at least thrice a week for the past seven years. So this is a topic close to heart but also one which is well debated and honed. A look at the Dutch disease and the fallacy of composition can help us understand why India needs her cricket team to fail spectacularly, and regularly, for Indian sport to truly flourish.*

 Indian cricketing success, even though much celebrated, will see (even) more money being poured into the sport and (even) more kids seeing cricket as the only viable professional sport option in this country. The popularity of the game itself has never been the chief concern – till it has reached the current scale. This popularity has led to investment, talent and a country’s sporting vision being squandered on a game which holds limited appeal to most of the world, doesn’t earn a single Olympic, Commonwealth or Asian games medal, a game which doesn’t foster a “sporting culture”, a game which doesn’t require its players to be athletic or fit, and most importantly a sport which has grown so big that it dwarfs all others, much to the detriment of every other sport.

**The Dutch disease** is a curious economic phenomenon. A mineral rich country sees its manufacturing sector battered, because all the exported minerals make the country’s currency stronger (because of higher demand for the country’s currency), thereby facilitating cheaper imports (as the relative cost of local manufacturing has gone up). Adam Smith’s invisible hand is at play here. What this also does is shrink investment in the manufacturing sector and sees more money being poured into the commodity unearthed and its ancillary industries – setting up transportation, refining/processing and marketing activities around that commodity.

The parallel with Indian cricket is there for all to see. Without even discussing the most brazen brainchild of the governing body of Indian cricket, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), the Indian Premier League which has sucked in large amounts of investment, the realization that a sporting Dutch disease has afflicted India is quite clear. Take the BCCI Corporate Trophy for example. This is an almost unheard of league, but serves as a traditional curtain raiser for the Indian season. The aim is to involve promising local players, discared players from an erstwhile rebel league (the ICL) and a few star players in order to showcase the “employability” of cricketers to corporates. The winning team bags INR10million. The runner up nets INR5million. That is 15 million rupees that have just been “awarded” to showcase “employability”. A gargantuan waste of money in a country where the total amount of investable funds for sport doesn’t grow much year on year. To help you put the plight of the nations “other sports” in perspective, the national football team earned INR28mn in sponsorship in 2013 – and sponsorship, along with broadcasting rights are two of the largest streams of income in sport.

**A provincial cricket league which dwarfs all of Indian football**

The Karnataka Cricket League (KCL), is sponsored by the realty developer Mantri who bought the sponsorship rights for INR110mn. This is a state level league, perhaps occupying a lower pedestal than the minor leagues (a parallel for the American reader). The franchise-auction for this league earned the state cricket association a whopping INR350mn in 2009. To put that in perspective, the All India Football Federation earned INR345mn in the sale of Broadcasting and Media rights in 2014. Adjusted for the inflation (at c10%p.a.) , a provincial cricket league was comfortably able to generate higher investment into setting up its franchises than the broadcasting rights of all Indian football.

Indian football received a grant of INR40mn from the Government in 2014 and India received a FIFA grant of INR32.385mn, for a total “grant” of INR72.3mn. The income side of the ledger is quite sparsely population for Indian football, with the only other income being paltry sums from AFC and a national team sponsorship of INR50m.

All India Football Fedeeration’s (AIFF) various streams of income in FY2014 can be seen [here](http://i.imgur.com/tkFkfOv.png)

The last two highlighted lines give you an indication of the different galaxies that the most popular Indian sport and the most popular global sport inhabit in India. Mahendra Singh Dhoni is India’s cricket captain and paid an income tax of INR200mn in 2014, the same as AIFF’s income without broadcasting rights. AIFF’s broadcasting rights are just 165% of Dhoni’s income tax. These are paltry figures which point to the state of the world’s most popular sport in the second most populous country in the world. It points to which sport has hogged almost all of the investable funds and public mind-space.

By 2014, all the teams in the Indian Premier League, IPL, stood at a cumulative loss, with multiple ownership scandals and ownership changes. Yet, the bubble continues to be backed by the “full trust” of the BCCI. The US Federal Reserve couldn’t inspire this much confidence in its Quantitative Easing programs! The total squad salary of each team in the IPL stands at INR600mn, INR55mn more than the entire income of Indian football’s governing body.
The numbers show the disparity between the two most popular sports in the country – and the gulf is wide enough for India’s sporting landscape to be diagnosed with the Dutch disease.

**Why more people need to refuse to watch or pay for cricket – in any form**

Imagine a country where most of the service sector is in private hands and they all exercise the “right to admission” and thus exclude a particular caste, colour, religion or creed of people from entering. They are all exercising a “private” right, but don’t realise that a collective deployment of private rights causes discrimination. This is a corollary of the fallacy of composition, but you get the idea.

The common refrain that I hear from the massive cricket support in India is that everyone is free to put their money and time to whichever sport they deem fit. All well and good. But when 800 million people exercise that right for just ONE sport, it becomes a Dutch Disease and an example of the fallacy of composition. By supporting cricket, you are snatching away the dreams of a young badminton player or a runner – because investable funds are tied up in a sport you (times 800 million) are interested in.

There is hope though. Stadium revenues, which make up for 40% of an IPL team’s income and television ratings are sliding – which points to lower interest due to a cricket overdose and a multitude of scandals. Higher costs, largely being imposed by BCCI, and lower revenues are bound to cause a crunch which will see many corporate backers and film star owners take a hit. This lower interest can be capitalized on by other sports, and there are some early signs that money is being put into other sports.

The current generation of non-cricketers who are winning medals at the Olympics and World Championships were probably “won” by their sports in a period where Indian cricket was at a low: in the late 90's and early 00's, when the first match fixing scandal disgusted and alienated a small part of the youth, your author included — I went on to have a mildly successful amateur career in squash.

These kids, who were then in their teens or even younger, are now your Saina Nehwals and Sushil Kumars – and they are athletes and they win medals, more than cricket has accomplished for the country or its cricketers.


*Another Olympic Games have come and gone with nary a worthy performance bar the great Indian women at the games.*

[OC] In depth overview and consequences of Real Madrid's financial results obtained over 23/24 season: Monumental achievement as the club becomes the 1st football club in the history to surpass €1 Billion mark in ordinary revenue i.e. without including any sale of assets (players or otherwise),"On 23rd July 2024, Real Madrid made a historical announcement:

> **[Real Madrid becomes the first football club to exceed one billion euros in revenue.](https://www.realmadrid.com/es-ES/noticias/club/actualidad/ejercicio-economico-2023-24-23-07-2024)**

The news spread like wildfire across all social media platforms and communities of not just football based forums but others sports like Basketball, Cricket, American Football and more communities. 

There were a lot of takes and hyperboles which may seem confusing to the average public, so here's my take to explain it in the simpler manner and the consequences of the the results by the club.

---

Lets start with initial summary presented by Real Madrid:



MILLIONS OF EUROS (Excluding Stadium Renovation)	| 2022/23	| 2023/24
---|---|----
Ordinary Income (without sale of players or assets)| 843.0	| 1,073.2
EBITDA before disposal | 84.1 | 143.6
EBITDA | 157.6| 156.3
Net Profit | 11.8 | 15.6
Cash available as of June 30| 128.2| 82.0
Net debt as of June 30| -46.8| 8.5

Points to learn from the summary:

1. Ordinary income has increased by a whooping **27%. This is by far the biggest jump in revenue in relative percentage points ever in Real Madrid's last 20 years history (data available to date)**
2. EBITDA without including player sales has increased by a staggering **71%.This is again the biggest jump in Real Madrid's recent history.** EBITDA stands for Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation, and Amortisation - The gold standard to assess a business's operating cash power. Higher the EBITDA, higher you can invest in the business whether buying players, infrastructure improvement, and more.
3. EBITDA including player sales shows a decline of 1M euros, but player sales are highly volatile and you cannot predict their history. Take example of Madrid selling Ronaldo for 100M+ or Barca selling Neymar for 222M, it is not expected that they will sell the similar player in next year - **Player sales are usually not taken into account when preparing a budget because of its unpredictable nature.** Especially for big clubs who do not usually sell their players during prime.
4. Net Profit only increased by 4M - I will explain the following in next few passages on why does a jump of 230M in revenue only lead to 4M increase in profits. (**Accountants reading this post already anticipate the answer - it lies in details: provisions, impairments, depreciations, interests and more**)
5. Cash available is the Treasury to meet out the daily needs, **Real Madrid holds 82M in their liquid cash available for any investment or daily expenditure, but with undrawn credit facilities of €395 million on top.**
6. Net Debt - This is the real component, and metric that killed Barcelona. **Real Madrid had a negative net debt, meaning they had more cash than debt obligations, if they paid all of their debt, they still had 46.8M available in their treasury. Now it has moved to 8M net debt position meaning Madrid only has 8M worth of net debt to pay.**

---

Now, First lets begin with dissecting the revenue obtained by Real Madrid into different categories by approximating the figures as shown in the official presentation by Real Madrid: 

**[Revenue 23/24](https://publish-p47754-e237306.adobeaemcloud.com/content/dam/portals/realmadrid-com/es-es/news/generic/2024/07/23/fotos/INGRESOS%20DE%20EXPLOTACI%C3%93N%20\(antes%20enajenaci%C3%B3n%20inmovilizado\).app.png?$Desktop$&wid=820)**:



MILLIONS OF EUROS	 | 2022/23| 2023/24
---|---|----
Stadium Income (Matchday & Concerts) | 125.0 | 275.0
Friendlies & International Competitions (CL, EC, CWC) | 125.0 | 130.0
Broadcasting Income | 225.0 | 200.0
Commercial Income | 368.0 | 473.0

Points to learn from revenue breakdown:

1. Stadium income has completely exploded by the renovation of Santiago Bernabeu: Ridiculous **120% increase! By far highest in Real Madrid's entire history.** Its clear the retractive pitch and the retractive roof alongside the impressive 85,000 capacity stadium has already started paying dividends and the project isn't even finished yet with Tours, Restaurants, VIP boxes, 2,000 parking spaces, new official megastore, a brand new Skybar and Skyroof at the top of the stadium yet to be fully opened. 
2. International competitions income increased by **5M as Real Madrid won the CL but didn't participate in the European Super Cup or the Club World Cup in the last year while reaching the semi-finals anyway.**
3. Broadcasting income is **reduced by 25M** because of Real Madrid non-cooperating with La Liga authorities regarding the new media programm of the league where clubs which cooperate and bring the cameras inside the dressing room and opt for half time, pre-match and post-match interviews receives extra income and clubs which opt-out have their income deducted from the last year. **Real Madrid had 0 non-cooperation policy and didn't even permit La Liga presenters to be allowed in the stadium let alone bringing camera in the dressing room leading to a heavy decline even after winningLa Liga.**
4. Commercial Income has again shown a huge increase of **28.5%, Its again the highest jump in recent years of Madrid's financial results**, now cementing Real Madrid at the top of commercial/sponsorship income leaderboards ahead of PSG and Man City, as they were previously trailing behind the two clubs. Real Madrid's commercial success comes down to these policies:
    - **Image Rights:** I know many of you've heard of it before, but not many understand how it works. Usually football clubs do not hold any percentage of image rights of the players. Real Madrid however since the Galacticos era, started a policy: 50/50 image rights split.
    - **Income from Players**: Under this split, any sponsorship agreement that a player signs/renews after joining Real Madrid - He has to give 50% of the increase in money to Real Madrid because club believes that by joining them, it increases the profile of its players. This is exactly how Galacticos era spearheaded Real Madrid's financial trajectory completely with Beckham, Ronaldo, Zidane, Raul, Roberto Carlos, Owen, and more and utilizing their stardom for financial gain.
    - **New Galacticos**: This sudden jump of Real Madrid's commercial income aligns with their players new found stardom. The likes of Vini Jr, Jude Bellingham, Rodrygo Goes, Fede Valverde and Eduardo Camavinga in particular have reached new heights in the image department scoring them lucrative sponsorship deals - This leads to Real Madrid's income being boosted with them because of the image rights agreement in place.

---

Other Important Details:

- **[Wage/Revenue Ratio](https://publish-p47754-e237306.adobeaemcloud.com/content/dam/portals/realmadrid-com/es-es/news/generic/2024/07/23/fotos/GASTOS%20DE%20PERSONAL%20SOBRE%20INGRESOS%20DE%20EXPLOTACION%20%E2%80%93%202.app.png?$Desktop$&wid=820)** - Real Madrid has posted an impressive **47% wages/revenue percentage**. This is 23 percentage points lower than UEFA's new FFP policy regulations figure (70%) meaning **Real Madrid can add a whooping extra 246M in players wages on topping of their current structure and still be compliant with the rules in place.**

- **[Net Debt](https://publish-p47754-e237306.adobeaemcloud.com/content/dam/portals/realmadrid-com/es-es/news/generic/2024/07/23/fotos/DEUDA%20NETA%20OK%20\(Excluido%20Proyecto%20Remodelaci%C3%B3n%20Estadio\)%20%E2%80%9323_24.app.jpg?$Desktop$&wid=820)** - **Real Madrid's Net Debt has changed to a positive 8M position, effectively a 0.1 Debt/EBITDA position, meaning that if Madrid were to pay off all of their debt, they would only have 8M in deficit.** Remarkable figure seeing how many clubs are completely sunken in bad debt positions like Barcelona, Man United, to name a few.

---

So why did Real Madrid posted only 15.6M profits on top of 1,073.2M revenue?

1. **Real Madrid is a 100% completely fan-owned organization with more than 80,000 members who all collectively 'own' the club.** Premier League club fans may confuse with what it means, but essentially Real Madrid (and even Barcelona) do not have any owners. The club is non-profit and is incentivized to invest everything it generates back to the club.
   - Bundesliga clubs also have a similar ownership structure with a caveat (50+1) - A club can sell 49% of its ownership maximum. Clubs like Bayern, Dortmund have minority investors using this policy but the core idea remains the same - Club belonging to its members.  
   - Argentine clubs, Portuguese clubs, Dutch clubs and more also come under similar ownership structures where fan-ownership is found in certain clubs to varying degrees of majority % ownership.
2. This is a double edged sword as well - **On one hand, there is no risk of money being siphoned off to an owner (Man United and their dividends with Glazers) but at the same time there is no position of getting artificial cash injections or owner's interest free loans as of (Chelsea and Clearlake + Roman investments, PSG, Man City cash injections, Arsenal and Kroenka investments or lately Man United and Jim Ratcliffe's cash injection)** - This means that a club like Barcelona who nearly bankrupted themselves cannot seek a quick recovery financially - They have to cut costs, save money and take good decisions to bring back the financial power in the club. Another reason why Real Madrid have been so conservative in transfer market recently and only taking players which benefit them in value/ability ratios.
3. Provisions - **Real Madrid since 21/22 has been adding up provisions in their account statements to release them in future need when income goes low.** They did in the past to incorporate the Sixth Street's 360M investment in Santiago Bernabeu by posting high provisions to save profit in order to save taxes.
4. Impairments - **Again, Real Madrid have been writing off players purchases as impairments to show less profits meaning less taxes**. They have done it so with Gareth Bale, Eden Hazard, Luka Jovic, and many other player transfers bringing their amortization amount to 0 by writing off the entire transfer fee in a single financial year. Club is expected to have done the same this year.
5. Depreciations - **Santiago Bernabeu's renovation is a capital expense and this is deprecated in the account statments. There is no cash going out the club because renovation was secured via loan** But depreciation acts as a metric to show your capital expense in the account statement to gain a better tax position.
6. Interests - **This is now a real kicker, Interests are real and not a non cash flow expense, It needs to be paid and it will be paid in case of Madrid's Bernabeu renovation.** Estimates suggest that Real Madrid have only started paying interest on their 1st tranche of loan as the next 2 are still in moratarium periods. 

---

Current Situation:

**Real Madrid is by far in its best financial position in their recent history (data available since 2000). They have near 0 net debt, highest revenue by far of any club, wages/revenue ratio of 47%**, a squad which is already rebuilt in the midfield and attacking department with players like:

- Mbappe (25)
- Vini Jr (24)
- Rodrygo (23)
- Endrick (18)
- Guler (19)
- Brahim Diaz (24)
- Bellingham (21)
- Camavinga (21)
- Valverde (26)
- Tchouameni (24)

There is only a real need of defensive reinforcements and the club can go for a long time without any capital investment needed in first-team.

**Real Madrid has posted ~150M EBITDA - Thats the amount of money that Real Madrid can invest in a transfer market every financial year (without including any player sales).**

But since the squad is already nearly complete - Club will continue to add provisions, impairments, to the statement to save taxes and keep improving their net debt position, in addition to infrastructure developments going under depreciation. 

---

Future Scope:

- **Real Madrid is expecting another huge increase in revenue in next year because of full inauguration of Santiago Bernabeu which is still partially finished**. Insiders suggest numbers near 450M from stadium income alone especially with the opening of Tours, VIP Boxes, Skybar, Skyroof, parking spaces, and more.
- **Club would gain a huge commercial boost because of addition of Kylian Mbappe and his staggering impact on the image rights department and general sponsorship deals.** This in top of Vini Jr and Bellingham's bigger media space with the two being potential Ballon D'or podium candidates.
- **Club is expected to increase its wages and operating expenses as well so the overall EBITDA will increase but I expect it to reach near 200M figures** and not expecting another 70% increase.
- **Club has launched 2 new projects: 'UNO By Real Madrid' - Hamburger chain which is expected to add 250 locations around the world and revenue of 750M by 2029** - This is an expensive bet if realized will absolutely skyrocket club's worth and revenue but again its still just a bet. **Other is the 'Corner By Real Madrid' - Airport catering around the world which opens its first locations in Spain this year.**


**Overall, the club is expected to make another 20%-25% revenue jump in 24/25 reaching figures as high as 1.3B.

Probable aftereffects of Gukesh winning the World Championship!,"One of the primary reasons some neutrals, including Hikaru, wanted Gukesh to win is because they thought that a Gukesh win will be good for chess as a whole. Let me speculate how it will affect Gukesh personally and the game of chess overall. 

Gukesh:

1. He will become one of the top 10 sports brands in India alongside the top cricketers, PV Sindhu and Neeraj Chopra. He is well spoken, good looking, has an aura, already has a strong female fan following (which is only going to grow) and is marketable. Till 2023 he didn't have any sponsors and now he might become one of the biggest sports celebrities in the country; couldn't have happened to a better or a more deserving guy. 

2. Personally he will have a target on his back, for the next couple of years at the very least. Rest assured that the Magnus generation will hit him with their A-game. And his peers (say 18-25 age range) like Alireza, Arjun, Pragg, Nodirbek, Vincent, Hans, Esipenko, Wei Yi, Parham, Nihal etc would like to think that they could beat him. Either way there will be a lot of result games and exciting chess. 

Chess: 

1. Can easily see a few more Indian corporates jump into the chess sponsorship scene. This might result in a few more closed tournaments in India and maybe some more elite events like the GCL. Currently we have 4 events - Tata Steel India Rapid and Blitz, Chennai Grandmasters backed by Tamil Nadu Government, one event from Magnus' freestyle chess tour and GCL backed by Tech Mahindra (although it is conducted outside India). Can easily see this rocket up to 10-12 events within the next couple of years. Westbridge Capital, Gukesh's sponsor and partner of Anand's WACA academy are planning a big event in India already. I can see other corporates like Ambani, Adani etc jump into the scene. And this is also where I can see people like Vincent and Duda (who don't necessarily get the top invites) benefitting from their association with Gukesh's team - they will now have the Indian fanbase cheering them on like they do with Anish. 

2. A lot of young players who don't have a sponsorship currently like Divya, Sadhwani and others will get sponsors. As will many others coming up through the ranks. His win will ease up the financial burden on the upcoming stars within the 12-20 age bracket. 

3. AICF has long been thinking of a club level tournament like the Bundesliga in India. No better time to start it now that the talent depth is insane with 85 GMs and many more upcoming players. Will also make chess as a financially viable career for say the top 20-30 Indian players at the very least. 

4. This may seem like a pipedream, but I think we might get a couple more FIDE events into the calendar. With Magnus Freestyle Chess Tour shaping up, there are talks of official chess960 ratings and we might very soon have a bi-annual chess960 world championship soon. I know this is a pipedream, but I can also sense a 8-10 player top event, with mixed formats like the Triathlon (consisting of Classical, rapid and Blitz) at the Biel Chess Festival. With Google coming in, probably Indian corporates jumping in and if FIDE manages to sway a few Wall Street corporates at the upcoming World Rapid and Blitz in New York, we are looking at a bunch of credible investors coming into the fold. 

Conclusion: 

All in all, an exciting year or two ahead for chess. But the chess world needs to find a way to shut the mouths of some of the salty top Russian chess players and their federation, who can hijack all the momentum chess has been building and drive the fans and possible sponsors away with their incessant, unfounded, chess cheating accusations.",https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/1hd8c1j/probable_aftereffects_of_gukesh_winning_the_world/,wildcardgyan,2024-12-13 14:04:30,94,chess

"Players should not be chided for playing t20 leagues because it might lead to the ""death of test cricket"".","In a recent article by Wisden, Steve Harmison, an English cricketer, goes over how the 5th IND vs ENG test match has been cancelled, more so due to the pressure by BCCI, because none of the players wanted to miss the initial matches of the 2nd leg of IPL and laments over how it might lead to the death of test cricket. Even if we were to put the conspiracy theories aside for a second, this episode warrants a discussion nonetheless. 

Cricket is first and foremost an occupation, and then a national service. It puts food on the plate of those who practice it professionally. I presume a lot of us here work 8-9 hour days 5-6 days a week. What if the lot was presented with an opportunity to get the same pay working a couple of hours day, the only downside to which can be the fact that gramps might not be impressed with the transition. This is in no way a jibe at test cricket. A lot of us, including me, prefer test cricket over any other format, and it rightly is the oldest format of the game, but it doesn't automatically grant it moral superiority over other formats. 

Cricketers are just professionals who offer their services on contract. It's not their job to bring back the ""glory days"" of the sport. They've got kids to raise and wives to be taken care of, like everybody else. For some of the gun t20 players, missing even a couple of matches at the start can lead to disastrous consequences for their franchises, and mind you, the prize money is huge, let alone the various sponsorships and awards scattered throughout the season. 

Test cricket is a beautiful format, it has revived careers and given fans moments to cherish all over the world, and it is here to stay. But belittling cricketers for their choices and defining hierarchies in cricket is not going to do anybody any good.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/pmvwdr/players_should_not_be_chided_for_playing_t20/,aman3009,2021-09-12 21:28:28,95,Cricket
Breaking Down Bates,"1. Since the plane touched down from Dubai, the Stew Crew has been nonstop on the go. Their Georgia influencer friends, the Hills, showed up for nail dates, shopping trips, Dollywood and a visit to the Biltmore Estate. Tyler Hill and Evan are so enamored that Evan recites Tyler’s Starbucks order from memory, and forgets to ask Carlin if she even wants anything. Carlin is now featuring mini-vlogs on her IG which Evan says she films with her iPhone. They rerun this same content on their YouTube where he has filmed everything with his Hollywood camera. That means the kids are being filmed by both parents at all times. They must spend an enormous amount of time editing out all of the normal/gross things kids do bc all we see from Layla and Zade is the same wide eyed wonder, faux excitement and Princess smiles. Over and over they feature Zade with heavy subtitles… subtitles are much easier than speech therapy, obviously. Carlin films herself wrapping gifts so they can have fake, filmed Christmas before heading to Nashville for real Christmas. They make a huge deal of the kids choosing presents for each other and exchanging them in brown paper sacks with white paper. They have a new in home camera set up so Evan can get overhead shots. They film openly in busy stores where you can see people stopping to watch…and they think this is a flex. Evan has the starring role in the new cult church’s Christmas cantata and then we see the Pastor and his wife piled up under blankets watching movies with their children. That seems normal…Both Layla and Zade work the entire holiday season making ads for Target and Amazon. Carlin happily packs and repacks their new $2000+ luggage sets and tries to convince us she doesn’t wash her hair while pushing dry shampoo. After a quick trip to Nashville the Stewarts are off to shop for a new car, buy Gil a new iPhone and head to the mountains for Gil’s 60th birthday celebration. Carlin is able to successfully navigate the weekend without speaking to or even standing near Erin and manages to corral Tori in for a quick picture. 2025 is sure to be a big year for the Stew Crew… will it include speech therapy, a security fence around the pool OR an ounce of privacy for their children?

2.Katie Clark continues to land big partnerships. The latest is Land’s End. Meanwhile, her 1 year old is still paying the bills. Hailey is in full on sistermom training mode baby wearing her doll and helping to feed baby Harvey. The Clarks head to the mall for the 65th time this month and have their kids picture made with Santa while both are fast asleep. Katie sold letters to Santa, takes pictures with Santa but refuses to say that Santa visits her kids. Katie announces that she is undergoing a major, massive hair overhaul. This involves removing her extensions, dying her hair the same exact color and trimming 1/4 of an inch. Travis just lavishes praise on her by saying she “looks like 2019 Katie”… and she lets us know that she will likely be getting extensions added again. They film a fake Christmas morning a week early for maximum exploitation and then Travis runs away to go play in Nashville while Katie has to recruit her mom to help her take Hailey to the doctor to have her cast removed. Travis makes a video with some YouTube duo named Caleb&Kelsey. It’s a cover of an old hymn but never fear… on the long trip to Jersey, he shares new music that sounds exactly like all of his other music and says it will be released in January. In their weekly vlog Katie is near tears again while talking about her hair, Travis explains that they have a dog sitter and they rerun the video of him and Evan singing at the tree farm. Driving home from NJ Katie tells us that she now has an Oura ring, they have a ski trip in Utah with her family in February, and all of their children will have an H name. They buy Gil 2 pair of shoes, which is definitely NOT a car and head off to the big weekend party. Katie films a party game where her parents are blindfolded and have to guess which child is speaking to them… someone in the crowd yells about 37 grandkids… they currently have 35 and one on the way… 2025 will definitely include a move for these 2…. Will Travis become a Dove Award winner? Will they offer their children the slightest bit of privacy?

3. Josie Balka is determined to be the bougiest Bates. Days before Christmas, she flies to NYC with friends and coworkers to pose and model at all of the hotspots, including MOMA, the Rockettes and Lion King on Broadway. The pool noodle is featured heavily and her friends are merely accessories. Back at home, Josie gets back to exploiting her children by taking them to Target and filming as they choose wrapping paper. Other shoppers are staring and stopped in their tracks…but Josie films anyway. Kelton shows off a ginormous 7 rib roast he was gifted by the guys at work. He preps and grills it for Christmas dinner. Shortly after Christmas Josie says they are all sick, except for Kelton, who of course is catering to them all hand and foot and made homemade chicken (pool?)noodle soup. They have to miss the big birthday getaway but the Effortless Shop continues to churn out hair curling content. 2025 should be the year the Balkas move into their secret McMansion in the country… will Josie eek another year out of the curler empire? Will the girls be filmed from the back only??

4. The original gangster, Alyssa Webster, returned to IG after almost 3 weeks of barely posting…& she came to slay. There was coffee content, doughnut content and deserted parks galore. We also saw garage workouts and heavily filtered cartoon children with disappearing noses… she really rolled out all of the greatest hits. Momma got a Hydrojug sponsorship and she promotes it disguised as a Q and A where she tells us all about her new hair which is bleached blonde, fried and frizzled with cow-lick bangs that she probably already regrets. The filter she uses is warped and she has never seemed more dated in her holey jeans. After all of the coffee content, she has a girls night at a coffee shop. A Christmas miracle seems to have happened and with no promotion at all, her sad hat shop has one less child sized hat, and one less adult sized hat. We don’t know if she actually sold two hats, or if John and Rhett just needed new ones. The weekly of Vlog shows baby Rhett with a mouth injury. Alyssa says he fell from a table… The cut is inside of his mouth and outside of his mouth, but they decide not to take him to a doctor. Instead, Alyssa allows him to open a Christmas present early while the girls have to watch. The Webster’s Christmas tree is full of gifts… Three times as many as usual. Alyssa says she went overboard with Christmas this year because the girls are getting bigger and they were very good girls this year. I think it is to make up for all of the gifts they will not be getting from the Bates family. Everything is wrapped in boring brown paper. They drop their Christmas special on YouTube and it shows the family in matching pajamas while Alyssa rules over them like a drill sergeant. They have to draw numbers this year and sit in a line to open gifts. The girls are beside themselves to have real gifts instead of shoes and Dollar Tree junk. Allie receives a Critter Corner dollhouse and figures and Maci receives a mermaid dollhouse. The middle two girls have to share a dollhouse and accessories. The gifts are nowhere near even and King Rhett has about 10  different things to open. Lurch is clueless about any of the gifts and has no idea what anything is. Several of the gifts are travel friendly and Alyssa mentions using them on the plane and for travel. Back during her 30th birthday Q and A she said she was contemplating possibly going to Tennessee for her dad‘s 60th birthday… At the time she said she was thinking about it. Could that be the plane ride she is speaking of? Post Christmas, Alyssa features a picture of she and John wearing Tennessee shirts… The music behind the picture is a bluegrass song talking about missing my Tennessee home. Obviously Alyssa is trolling… The speculation about her attendance at her dad‘s 60th birthday is the most excitement she has generated in quite some time. The party weekend comes and goes and no Websters are spotted. Will she fly in when everyone else goes home? Will she stop by on her way to Washington DC for her father-in-law‘s swearing in? In 2025 will we discover WHO Alyssa is angry with? Will she finally land a coffee partnership? Will her children be allowed out of the house?

5. Zach and Whitney Bates celebrated their 11th wedding anniversary with a night out on the town. Whitney wears the boutiques clothes for the date and remains the main one focused on the business. Zach films a reel cooking another steak meal with Bradley and I am convinced they own stock in a cattle farm. Zach invites Michael on for an episode of the Bates Kitchen. He watches while she makes a skillet cobbler with Kaci and Khloe. She has made this hundreds of times growing up. Zach eeks out a second episode with Michael featuring a question and answer session where they talk about their childhood. Michael says cooking was one of the chore choices and she always chose it and Zach gives her credit for raising babies and doing the majority of the cooking. Zach and Whitney take their kids to Dollywood with their new influencer friends and the Stew Crew. Christmas night, Whitney is the first to begin posting links again. They pack up and head out for Gil‘s 60th birthday and on the way Zach tells us that their dog Scout always stays with a dog trainer/border when they travel. Whitney shares pictures of the baby with the dog. It’s a great proof of life that Scout is alive and well, and probably proof that they live in this Sub. At the resort, we see Zach four wheeling with his kids and grilling. They gift his dad a Blackstone grill for his birthday and Zach says he will give Gil a tutorial. Will 2025 bring Zach a Food Network contract? Will Whitney manage to chug down even more powdered supplements? Will their kids continue to be exploited for the almighty dollar??

6. Erin Paine managed to escape from her beef fat manufacturing long enough to beg the Internet to give her a hammered dulcimer for her kid’s Christmas… Let that sentence sink in… She also happily promoted Lawson‘s Cowboy Christmas song by saying her children had listened to it on repeat. Once Erin sold all of her beef fat moisturizer, she had enough money to rent a moving truck, and suddenly their plans to spend Christmas in Florida changed, and packing quickly commenced. Isaiah and Addee showed up to help pack, along with some Florida friends and that allowed Erin to sit on the couch and film it all. Erin celebrates her best friend and sister Tori’s birthday and she is absolutely giddy to report that they are heading to a cabin in the Smoky mountains to celebrate Christmas with Tori and her family. I guess Bobby is OK with the Paines constantly crashing his vacation. Erin tells us that they have finally found a home, but they will not be moving in until after the holidays and celebrating her dad‘s birthday. Erin happily shows off her Oura ring along with her homemade gifts from her children and the huge beef tenderloin they have for Christmas dinner. Erin manages to keep several siblings between her and Carlin all weekend while celebrating her dad‘s birthday. 2025 could see the Paine family drop the doodles and become full time beef fat forgers. Will they stay consistent on YouTube for a check? Will Carson/Charles(Carles) begin to smile again?

7. Lydia Bates decided to make over her bedroom and changed her white bed to… a different white bed. Trace insists on shaving off baby Ryker‘s hair and Lydia does not seem happy about it. Their Vlog is sponsored by Barbers United and Ryker ends up with the same haircut as every other fundie man. They promise to show their families reactions of their birth announcement, but wind up with just a few seconds of reaction… Trace tells us they lost the other footage, but to trust him that everyone was so excited…rookie mistake Trace. Trace and Lydia head to the farm in South Carolina for Christmas and they are the only married couple there. JebJud and Callie squeeze into the backseat for the ride. We see aunt Jenny‘s Christmas party and cookie decorating contest. Lydia and Trace seem to be very close with the extended family and don’t miss many get togethers.  They head back home for Gil‘s 60th birthday party. In 2025 we know a new baby will arrive… will they move? Will Trace actually work construction jobs or will Ryker continue to be the main provider?

8. Michael and Brandon feature the Balka girls making cookies while they discuss Christmas memories. Tori’s kids pop up for a craft and one of them is wearing Alyssa’s sad hat. Michael helps Zach out by actually competently cooking on film and explains that she and Brandon plan to switch to vlogging in the New Year. At Gil‘s birthday party in the resort Michael plays nanny all weekend, holding babies, watching kids and completing crafts. Her siblings all praise her. What will 2025 bring for the Keilens? Will we find out about Brandon’s mystery job? Will Michael up her babysitter fees? Will they continue to exploit their nieces and nephews for views? 

9. Lawson and Tiffany continue their California trip with lots of eating out, tea parties and placing baby Will in odd places like under the Christmas tree. Lawson debuts a music video for his cringey Cowboy Christmas song. Tiffany shows off her dad‘s antique airplane and continuously shows Lawson and the baby in bed shirtless. After several weeks, they have a new YouTube Vlog which shows Lawson in the studio recording Christmas music while Tiffany attempts to handle the baby alone. Apparently it is too much for her to handle because they show up for day two in the studio with a babysitter. Tiffany sings Silent Night and all of the comments are praising her while Lawson‘s talents bring… Crickets. Out of all of the Christmas songs, he only releases his fever dream and Tiffy’s remains buried. Maybe next year! Mysteriously their YouTube vlogs that have been out for months have over 100,000 views… They are receiving pretty good money from YouTube at this point. Tiffy posts several reels reminding everyone that last Christmas no one knew she was pregnant… Is that a hint? Lawson and Tiffany leave California and make it to Tennessee in time for Gil’s 60th birthday party… Tiffany shares nothing from the party but does share pictures of her family with baby Will on the beach. Lawson shares pictures of baby Will with Jane and Bill who are in town for the party. 2025 could be the year these 2 fully move to California… will they show us Duke again? Will Lawson learn to hold his child? Will Tiffy finally be accepted by the Bates sisters?

10.Kelly was busy wishing happy birthday to Tori, happy anniversary to Zach and Whitney and Bobby and Tori as well as celebrating her own anniversary. Gil did absolutely nothing special for the day and Kelly shows them at home eating lasagna made by Michael. There is now a big screen TV on the wall of the big house… Times are definitely changing. Proving that she is becoming a full on influencer, Kelly featured the Bates Sisters Boutique lounge sets for a mere $80 apiece. She also tagged the resort that comped them the cabins for Gil’s 60th birthday. We see pictures and videos of Kelly and Gil with the younger children at the farm for Christmas. Almost all of the children praise her for the huge display of gifts she gave everyone. Who knows where Kelly is getting her money from these days… but they certainly don’t mention Gil in the praises. In the new year will KJ continue her glow up? Will she become a full on content creator? Will she trade in the dang denim skirt??

Happy New Year friends…. Here’s wishing you all a prosperous 2025!",https://www.reddit.com/r/BatesSnark/comments/1hpl4dn/breaking_down_bates/,dixcgirl10,2024-12-30 16:17:01,89,BatesSnark
r/cricket Quiz of the Decade,"It's a few days late I realise, but we've just witnessed the conclusion of perhaps the most momentous decade in cricket history. We've seen a revolution in the game, the growing domiantion of T20, the rise of uncertainty towards test cricket's place in the global game; globetrotting mercenaries, match-fixing, ball-tampering, T10, new test teams, a shrinking World Cup, the PIG3, unbelievable finishes, famous wins, disastrous losses and some really terrible memes to boot. So what better way to remember it all than with a jumbo quiz of the cricketing decade.


There's 7 rounds, with 10 questions each, for a total of 70 questions. You can take it however you wish - you can google everything and get 70/70 or trust your cricket knowledge and take it blind.

First time UK viewer - Didn't realise just how commercialised this sport is,"Prior to yesterdays pre-season games the only live games I'd ever seen were Superbowl games which are covered in the UK by the BBC and so miss out on a lot of the commercial side of things.

But this year I decided to purchase the game pass for myself and as such I watched a couple of the pre-season games from yesterday and thoroughly enjoyed it.

I just couldn't believe how many advertisements there is, everything seems to have a sponsor and the commentators reading out slogans and endorsing sponsors really shocked me.

The only sport I can think of that even comes close to this level of endorsement is the IPL (Cricket - Indian Premier League). 

It did become a bit tedious continously watching a blank screen (the NFL game pass in the UK doesn't show any interval commercials) but that didn't bother me too much as I understand that it is a stop-start sport, I think it was just shocking for a UK viewer where sponsorship in our sports are literally just one advert before the program comes on and maybe a logo on a team jersey.

All this aside I had a great time watching the games yesterday and I'm really looking forward to watching the regular season now! :)

Just to clear it up as I might have worded this whole post wrong, I'm not saying it's a bad thing, I'm just saying that it surprised me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/4xd2dh/first_time_uk_viewer_didnt_realise_just_how/,BunniWolf,2016-08-12 16:33:57,88,nfl

Did Cricket Victoria greed ruined Big Bash in Victoria,"(ffs grammar in the headline I fixed when rewriting it....)

This is a bit of a bugbear of mine.... so ignore and move on if you like. But its Christmas and I'm a bit bored and hiding from family.

In 2018 Cricket Victoria was in a spot of bother. They had a bit of debt to get rid of and some staff that were looking for the chop. But... can't have that happen and consequences for their poor management so they had a look around, in particular at Cricket NSW, to work out where their revenue came from and noticed that a decent chunk of NSW revenue came from the Big Bash League.

Up until that date, even with only one trophy, the two Vic clubs had been reasonably well run and successful. They had volunteer boards run mostly by AFL or ex-AFL who knew Victoria and could put on a decent show and knew the members weren't just patsies to pad out the execs bonuses. By all reports there were some decent CEOs and other full-time staff. Chairs like McGuire and Dunstall, whatever you think of them, aren't idiots. They recruited well and seem to be reasonably well run during the season. There was a different vibe between the clubs (east vs west, literal stars vs moneyball) and a burgeoning rivalry with the renegades upsetting the stars in one of the biggest BBL upsets in BBL08 (aka 2018/19).

For the first eight seasons the Stars finished 4, 3, 1, 3, 2, 4, 6, 4 for an average position of  **3.4**.

For the first eight seasons the Renegades were.... hit and miss finishing 7, 1, 6, 6, 5, 5, 3, 2 for an average position of **4.4**.

So.... Cricket Victoria booted out all of these competent part time and full time staff and gave those roles to their own folk (aka brought it in-house)  [https://www.cricket.com.au/news/3303438/cricket-victoria-takes-over-bbl-clubs](https://www.cricket.com.au/news/3303438/cricket-victoria-takes-over-bbl-clubs)

At the time when it happened one of the recruiters for the renegades brought a bit of attention to the changes and looming disaster which caught my attention at the time and has since. However it was Liam Pickering and he can be a bit salty so I thought I'd look back in a few years. And here we are. Looks like he was as right with this as he was with Franklin's 10 year deal. Good for him. Hello Liam if you're googling yourself again.

Stars still topped in BBL09 but since then have finished 7th, 6th and 8th. They are this season currently in 8th. Including current position they average **7.25** the past four seasons (a drop of nearly four!). I'm discounting that initial top finish in 2019/20 but with that included they average **6.0** (a drop of 2.6 positions).

Renegades have been even more dire finishing 8th, 8th, 8th, 3rd\* and currently sitting 7th. (The 3rd was a 7-6 barely winning season and they got smashed in the first final). Since Cricket Vic took over this is an average position of **6.8**.

There are zero consequences for the faceless mediocre white middle-aged men at Cricket Victoria. Just a bunch of idiots who failed upwards managing simple sponsorship relationships with no actual talent required and found themselves in charge.

The game atmosphere is dead. Money scrimping is always on show compared to the previous administrations. I can't imagine a shit tip like what was served in Geelong for Renegades vs Scorchers happening under competent and engaged staff. The only difference between the clubs is the colour of the strip.

But no one cares, its a bit of hit and giggle right? We have so little state cricket and its hard to follow shield these days.... I want a bit more.

(postscript theorising... I do feel that this drop in the Vic teams has resulted in reduce local interest which impacts the wider national numbers. But that's spitballing and I'm not sure where to find ratings by state for Big Bash over the years and I probably need to get back to poorly wrapping presents)

Anyway, I was so caught up in rFactor 2 that I actually *forgot* the first driver I randomly generated. Whoops. Nevermind, my second roll of the dice, #603, probably provides for a more interesting story...

### Part 1: Which girl were you from? ###

Okay, that headline was a bit mean and unwarranted to poor Nelson Piquet Sr., but when you've had seven children to four different women, it's pretty much apt for the playboy attitude that the elder Piquet has lived with.

Anyway, to answer that above question, it was the second girl, Sylvia Tamsma, former girlfriend of Elio de Angelis, that gave birth to Nelson Angelo Piquet Jr. on July 25th, 1985, just a few miles away from the Hockenheimring. Who knows what was going on at Hockenheim around that time, especially because the German Grand Prix that year was held at the *Nurburgring* a week later, not Hockenheim. Just something I found odd.

Anyway, it didn't take long after Piquet Jr.'s birth for the family to split up, leaving Piquet Jr. to live with his mother in Monaco. Then Piquet Sr. had another child with another girl. Then he got back together with Tamsma. And had two children, Julia and Daniil Kvyat's girlfriend. And then split with Tamsma again.

*You got all that?* Good.

Following that second split, Piquet Jr. went to live with his father this time, particularly as his mother thought of Brazil as a better place to grow up than Monaco and that the younger Piquet can grow up to be a racing driver, just like his dad.

And so, not long after his massive Indy 500 crash, Piquet Sr. held off racing full-time to support his son's karting career from 1993 onwards. Piquet Jr. spent quite a while in karting, but when the time came for him to move up in 2001, his father founded a brand new team, Piquet Sports, for his son to compete in the upcoming Formula 3 Sudamericana season.

Despite missing the first four races of 2001, Piquet performed exceptionally, taking one win that year. But come 2002, Piquet Jr. was the star of the show. 13 wins out of 18. Whew, lad. It was hardly impressive given the standards of Formula 3 Sudamericana, but 13 wins in 18 is nothing to be sniffed at.

What *has* to be admired, though, was the way Nelson Piquet Jr. arrived onto the Formula Three scene in Great Britian. In his first season there, he notched up six wins on tracks he didn't even know, not to mention a credible second place at the Formula Three Masters event at Zandvoort. Following this up by winning the British Formula Three championship the following season, everyone was starting to believe that this guy truly is the new Nelson Piquet.

Well, duh. It's his son.
*****

### Part 2: Winner of a World Cup event ###

So, 2005 comes around, and Nelson Piquet Jr. is still being shadowed by hid dad, taking him to greater levels of motorsport, all while making sure he had a drive by promoting his Piquet Sports team alongside his son. Partnering with Hitech Racing, the relationship between the two teams was rocky at best, with Piquet Jr. having his most trying season in motorsport yet, with a win at Spa Francorchamps being his only high point of the season.

So, in the off-season, he tried something new: *The World Cup*

No, you dummy. Not the FIFA World Cup. Or rugby. Or Cricket.

**The World Cup Of Motorsport**, A1 Grand Prix.

This absolute gem of a racing series, probably still the best concept for a racing series I have ever seen alongside the Speedcar Series, had drivers representing their home nations throughout the season, scoring points for their respective countries. Holding a similar prestige to Formula E nowadays, the series featured a few relatively unknown drivers like Basil Shabaan, *many* a future prospect like Piquet Jr. himself but also showcased some old Formula One talent as well like Jos Verstappen, father of Max, and Alex Yoong.

With the first race at Brands Hatch being shown to a worldwide audience, Piquet Jr. went ahead and showed himself to the world as the rightful heir to the Piquet name by taking pole, setting fastest lap, leading every lap in the sprint race and winning *both* races in that first event at Brand Hatch. Though it would be Team France that would dominate that first season and take home the World Cup of Motorsport, Piquet held his own until he was called back to GP2 duties for 2006...

**[HERE COMES A NEW CHALLENGER!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PmEtJX3Els)**. A British prospect everybody is drooling over. Handpicked by McLaren from young. Everybody is saying he is the future. He is **Lewis Hamilton**.

2006 was going to be a tough title fight for Piquet Jr. He'd taken the championship in the second season of every series he ran in, but now was a different challenge. Piquet Jr., like Hamilton, was Brazil's prospect, their next Senna, if not the next Barrichello.

Early in the season, Piquet got the jump by winning the first feature race of the season at Valencia, and jumped out to a early season lead after Imola. But then Hamilton won both races at the next weekend at the Nurburgring, followed by another double win at Silverstone, and the championship swung well into Hamilton's favour. The title seemed well out of Piquet's reach, but then he did the impossible.

At the Hungaroring, he sat on pole for the feature race, then took the win and the fastest lap in both the feature and sprint races, a performance reminiscent of his name-making moment at Brands in A1 Grand Prix. He took the *maximum points possible* from that event, a feat only replicated a few years later by a certain Nico Hulkenberg. This helped him close the gap right up to Hamilton heading to the final event at Monza, where Hamilton still eventually won out.

Piquet Jr. ended 2006 on a high note, winning the Mil Milhas (*1000 miles) Brasil alongside his dad and two other fellows in the car whose names escape me at this moment of time. This wasn't his first achievement in endurance racing, coming in fourth in his GT1 class during the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

So, present day, Lewis Hamilton is a four-time champion in Formula One. Nelson Piquet Jr. only has one podium to his name.

So, what happened?

Flavio Briatore happened.
*****

### Part 3: Fever from the Flavio ###

Right. Flavio Briatore. Him. I don't know about this subreddit's general consensus on the guy, whether he should be lauded for guiding the careers of several drivers like Michael Schumacher, Mark Webber and Fernando Alonso among other or disgraced for his constant arrests on cases of fraud, cheating throughout his Formula One career or *that* image of him in a thong. (*You find that image for yourself, I'm too kind to burn your eyes like that*)

Personally, researching into what he did for Piquet Jr., I think he is a **piece of shit.**

Seeing how Flavio managed drivers to relative levels of success in Formula One in the past, Nelson Piquet Sr. signed his son on with Flavio Briatore for a management contract from 2007 onwards. Big mistake. For the *entirety* of 2007, Nelson Piquet Jr. was stuck being Renault's test driver for the full year. Unlike other dedicated test drivers in the likes of Gary Paffett, Briatore didn't allow Piquet Jr. to race in any other racing series, forcing him to churn the whole year putting in endless miles for Renault.

In 2008, Piquet Jr. finally got the nod to enter Renault's Formula One squad, but even *then* the promotion felt like a backhanded compliment. Fernando Alonso, following his one-season stand with McLaren and his infamous rivalry with Lewis Hamilton, made the jump back home to Renault to avoid the toxic situation at McLaren. Following this, Flavio Briatore opted to let go of Heikki Kovalainen from Renault, fearful that the Finn might provide competition to Alonso throughout the course of the season.

So Piquet Jr. was brought in. Simply because he was **slower** than the other person in contention for Renault's no.2 seat.

That's a new way of being promoted to F1, based on your lack of pace.

And early in the season, Piquet Jr. did indeed have that absence of pace, racecraft, or anything to keep his car on the road. Three crashes after the first six races. Only popping into Q3 just once in those first few races, something Alonso did for every race bar one. After the first few races, Piquet Jr. lost all attention from Flavio and co. as a new rookie driver that needs development, simply treating him as just *'the other driver in the other car'*, as Nelsinho puts it himself.

The *'other driver'* that would overtake Alonso in the final few laps of Renault's home race to score his first points.

The *'other driver'* that went on to take Renault's first podium of the year in Germany.

Granted, that podium came down due to Renault getting real lucky with their one-stop pit strategy, pitting just before Tim O'Glock brought out the safety car, but still. Piquet Jr. acutally led the race until three laps to go, when Hamilton dove past on the inside, but Piquet still guided the car home to a wonderful second place, just miles away from his birthplace, 5 days before his 23rd birthday. This was the result that would surely put Piquet Jr. into Flavio's good books...

*No, no, nope*. Flavio still placed most of the team's back behind Fernando, releagting Piquet Jr. to a true no.2 driver role. Piquet's second half of the season after Germany was marginally better than the first half, with a good run to fourth in Fuji on a day where the Renaults were strong. His season was still littered with accidents though, especially one in Singapore where his accident brought out a perfectly timed safety car for his teammate, Fernando Alonso, gambling on a risky strategy, on Alonso's way to victory, Renault's **first** in 2008.

And then came 2009. Incredibly, despite talk that a certain Jean-Pierre Jabouille lookalike would replace Nelsinho, Renault retained him for the next year. And that's where Flavio's assholish tendencies came through.

He promised Piquet Jr. that his testing environment will be exactly the same as Alonso's, with the caveat that if Piquet didn't score **40%** of Alonso's points, he would fire him at mid-season. Clearly, the pressure was on Nelsinho's shoulders, but it seemed like he could achieve 40% of Alonso's points by mid season. Right?

Yeah, nope. Piquet was limited to three days of dry weather testing, clocking 2000 kilometres. Alonso, who requested more time with the car to get used to the 2009 regulations, amassed nearly twice as much distance during pre-season testing. Likewise, Piquet often claimed all his tests were on hard tyres, heavy fuel loads and a barely rubbered in track, something that would have hampered his qualifying pace in a real track situation, as Alonso got optimal conditions for simulated qualifying runs.

Whether if it was down to the lack of testing or just disappointing driving, Piquet Jr. barely left a mark on the 2009 season, apart from being the first Formula One driver to join Twitter. Briatore was starting to come down hard on Piquet, with all the upgrades going Alonso's way through the course of the season. Still, performances like in China, spinning off several times and requiring *several* replacement nosecones, gave Briatore some excuse to ignore the Brazilian.

Come the Hungarian Grand Prix, the same race where his teammate worked a minor miracle and placed his Renault on pole, Nelson Piquet Jr. could only qualify 14th. After an anonymous race, Briatore fired him from the team, having scored **zero** points in 2009, replacing him with said Jean-Pierre Jabouille lookalike, Romain Grosjean.

Piquet Jr. definitely wasn't fast. He was quite a lot slower compared to his teammate. Yet he felt he wasn't given a fair share of the deal.

And he was gonna let the world **know**.

*****

### Part 4: Biting Back on Briatore ###

The way Formula One drivers are nowadays, they always seem to talk good about the team (*save Fernando Alonso and his Honda engines...*), praising the mechanics, showing face to the team boss.

Piquet Jr. was never like that.

Even before he left Renault, you could tell he hated the team, or at least Flavio Briatore. In April 2009, he caught up with F1Racing Magazine to answer questions directed at him from subscribers of the magazine. Apart from saying he liked the Valencia Street Circuit (*the madman*), spoon fights with mechanics, and denying a modelling career vehemently, Piquet Jr. saved his harshest criticisms to a certain Italian boss...

---

>> **Did you ever think your contract might not be renewed for 2009?** *Gregory Haines, Spain*

> Piquet: *""...I think I managed to do the best job I could. Still, having Flavio as a boss isn't easy.""*

>> **Flavio Briatore: Always fair? Always supportive?** *Andy Beaux Bottomley, UK* (GREAT NAME)

> Piquet: *""Not always. He can be really tough and you need to be able to ignore the right things, absorb the right things and be able to judge everything""*

>> **Eddie Irvine said being in Ferrari with Michael Schumacher was like being hit over the head with a cricket bat for four days. How would you describe it with Alonso?** *Richard Ralf, UK*

> Piquet: *""Well, maybe a bit similar! It's very tough, yeah. I would say it was nearly that""*.

Yep, Piquet also didn't hold back anything when mentioning his teammate. Mind you, he was *still with Renault* at the time of this interview. So when he got fired, my goodness me did Piquet Jr. explode. He released quite a lengthy statement, blasting Flavio Briatore as his 'executioner'. [Here's the link to the full statement that, well, is quite damning.](https://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/2009/08/03/piquets-scathing-attack-on-briatore/)

There was one question from that interview, though, that stuck out...

>> **People say you crashed deliberately in Singapore. Was it team strategy?** *Mathieu Villeton, France*

> Piquet: *""[Laughs] Yeah, I wanted to try and kill myself to help Fernando get a podium. I pushed hard and I spun. The team called Fernando in at the right moment. Shit happens to me and he gets lucky. Like in pre-season testing this year!""*

He answered Mathieu's question while in Renault. 

Now though, Nelson Piquet Jr. was fired. And he hated Briatore.

Time to prove that one guy, Mathieu Villeton, correct.

You all have probably heard of Crashgate by now. For those that haven't, you are living under a massive rock. Go ahead and read [the full wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renault_Formula_One_crash_controversy) that covers this entire controversy, but if you want a quick TL;DR...

Singapore, 2008. Renault gives Alonso weird pit strategy. It needs a safety car to work. They ask Piquet Jr. to crash to bring out said safety car. [He even *PRACTISED* the crash during the warm-up lap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feXvqfttAuw). Alonso pits, then Piquet crashes, and Alonso wins. Now Piquet Jr. is fired. He goes ahead and reveals *all*. Briatore tries to accuse him and his father for attempting to blackmail Renault into hiring him back into the squad for the season's end. Piquet Jr. hits them with a truth bomb: *""Because I am telling the truth, I have nothing to fear...""*

End result: Briatore and engineering director Pat Symonds leave Renault before getting banned from all motorsport involvement until 2011, with a further ban from F1 events until 2013. Could've been worse for Briatore, with his initial punishment being a *ban for life* on all motorsport activity. ING and Mutua Madrilena remove their sponsorship deals with Renault effectively. Piquet Jr. will never step into a Formula One car again, but at least he got the pleasure of seeing his *'executioner'* punished for his involvement in the scenario.

### Part 5: Ride Hopper ###

So what did Nelson Piquet Jr. get up to following his time in Formula One? 

He made the simple, logical step to race in the Camping World Truck Series in NASCAR, obviously. And for a guy that raced single seaters for the majority of his life, he adapted quite well to pickup trucks. He was a constant frequenter of the top-10, and his 2012 season was doubly impressive, managing two wins and finishing in the top-10 on thirteen ocassions. That year, he also started a switch to the Nationwide series, winning one of his only outings that year at Road America in preparation for his full-time assault at the Nationwide series next year.

Unfortunately, his one full year at NASCAR's second tier wasn't remembered for his stellar drives or lack thereof. Instead, it's mostly remembered for Piquet Jr. imitating his father in [the form of below-the-belt martial arts](https://youtu.be/v2ExFzKFnsA?t=84).

From there, his career went all sorts of directions. He made a few attempts at the Global Rallycross Championship, pulling a complete Scott Speed and actually *being competitive* off-road. He also had a very, very brief spell in both Indy Lights and Brazilian Stock Cars, managing one pole position in each series. He also attempted, earlier this year, to compete in the 24 Hours of Le Mans with Rebellion Racing, actually managing to come in third overall, second in LMP2 class. However, it seemed that fate wanted to bite Piquet Jr. in the ass one more time, as officials disqualified the car, making illegal modifications to the floor of the car in previous attempts to repair it.

Finally, Nelson Piquet Jr. was signed by NextEV Team China to drive for them in the new, all-electric motorsport series, Formula E. In his first season, he finally achieved something in the motorsport world. After representing his country in the World Cup, his battle with Hamilton all the chaos in Renault, Crashgate, his words for Flavio Briatore, fisticuffs, below-the-belt kicks and his rallycrossing phase, Nelson Piquet Jr. finally won his first international championship, beating Sebastien Buemi by a solitary point to be crowned Formula E's inaugural champion.

His two years afterwards in Formula E may not have been as spectacular, but that one Formula E title, I bet, was all worth it. 

*****

Yep, another one down. I actually had to dig right through my F1Racing Magazine archive for this, the one time those magazines had been useful in my life. I don't know if I've portrayed Piquet in *too* much of a positive light, given how I think he's very, *very* crash happy, but I think he deserves Piquet Jr. deserves a bit of sympathy at the very least.

Oh, and buy rFactor 2. Have I mentioned it's amazing yet? (*Once again, I'm not sponsored, blah blah blah*)

How John Howard and a Mexican billionaire helped save the Western Bulldogs,"Whitten Oval in Melbourne’s Footscray used to be a “rat-infested and tinea-infected” hellhole. Like the Western Bulldogs, it looked like it would fall apart at any moment.

Yet two unlikely figures, ex-Liberal prime minister John Howard and mystery Mexican billionaire Juan Gonzalez, helped kickstart a revolution that has transformed the Bulldogs and their home base from downtrodden battlers to a club brimming with confidence.

The Bulldogs, based in Labor heartland, managed to convince Howard during the 2004 election campaign there was merit in helping fund a much needed revamp of Whitten Oval. It was the beginning of a big rebuild on and off the field for the club, which will take on Melbourne in the AFL grand final in Perth on Saturday evening.

“There was certainly nothing in it for us for politically,” Howard told The Australian.

“But I thought this was a good proposition and if they used the money wisely, it would be a good thing for the community. And that has turned out to be the case. I was pleased and the community seemed to appreciate it.”

The Bulldogs used to be perennially on the verge of collapse or insolvency and the AFL seemed happy to watch the club go out of business.

Now they’re about to appear in their second grand final in five years and the club is a model of off-field strength and on-field brilliance and nous, encapsulated by coach Luke Beveridge and star captain Marcus Bontempelli.

“We’ve been able to build quite nicely over the past few weeks. But we’re coming up against a team with a good brand of football as well, so it should a good contest,” Bontempelli said this week about the grand final opponent.

As for Beveridge, he has defended his players to the hilt, describing the “collision footy” the Bulldogs played in their preliminary final win against Port Adelaide two weekends ago as “outrageously good”.

Going back further, though, a couple of secret meetings were key to radical changes that have underpinned the Bulldogs’ success story.

One was Howard agreeing to the game-changing revamp plan put up by ex-Bulldogs chief executive Campbell Rose in a federal seat the Coalition would never have a hope of winning.

The other involved billionaire Gonzalez, the Mexican boss of Mission Foods, being snatched by the Bulldogs, ironically, from under the noses of Melbourne in a clandestine move involving Bulldogs paraphernalia, expensive guitars and fast-food giants.

Whitten Oval was in such a bad way, says then club president David Smorgon, that “there were prostitutes and druggies in the carpark and you’d get out of the offices there before dark because you didn’t want to be there when the lights got turned off”.

Rose decided a circuit-breaker was needed and, with the 2004 election looming, armed himself with a 38-page document and with the assistance of Howard’s chief of staff, Arthur Sinodinos, convinced Howard to travel to Melbourne’s west to announce what was to become a $9.5m funding package to rebuild the ground and include community and education facilities.

“We got him to be the first prime minister to run through an AFL club banner,” Rose, now working in Silicon Valley, says. “But this was a Liberal PM funding something in Footscray. It was counterintuitive, it was a circuit-breaker. It was a case of ‘wow, where did this come from?’.”

The state government would also agree to put in funds, and with the help of several foundations and wealthy supporters such as Smorgon and Susan Alberti, Whitten Oval underwent a $32.5m rebuild. “It was a miracle,” Smorgon says.

“It’s an area made up of people from many countries but bound together by a love of sport, by a love of Australia and by a belief that sporting clubs can act as a great community cement,” Howard would say when reopening Whitten Oval two years after beating Labor’s Mark Latham in the election.

While Rose says Howard’s Bulldogs pledge was an election turning point, it’s more likely the famous handshake with Latham played a bigger role. But it certainly didn’t hurt him turning up at Whitten Oval.

Named for late favourite son Ted Whitten Sr, the ground sits in a region battered by lockdown and at times ravaged by Covid in the past 18 months but one that is proud of its team and its roots.

“It has struck me here, the expectation of community representation,” Bulldogs chief executive Ameet Bains says.

“It’s sometimes seen in sport that you shouldn’t get involved in community and social advocacy. But if we don’t do that as a club, then our members get into us for not speaking up. As a result, we do see our role to advocate on a number of issues.”

Bains says Bontempelli is an example of a team determined to win but one conscious of its role at the club and in the community. “He’s such a humble champion really. He has that combination of a hard edge who is so driven to compete, with a soft and caring side away from the field.”

An upcoming $70m revamp of Whitten Oval awaits, finally giving the Bulldogs foundation a permanent home alongside education, sporting and other facilities to deliver its various health and education programs, and the ground could soon be used as a Covid vaccination hub.

The Bulldogs still have a working-class image, though, which provides a contrast to Melbourne’s supposed blue-blooded supporter base.

Yet both clubs have previously struggled financially over the years. Peter Gordon, the pugnacious lawyer, stepped down as Bulldogs president last year after helping save the club in 1989 and overseeing the drought-breaking 2016 grand final win and the clearing of all debt, before handing the reins to current president Kylie Watson-Wheeler.

The Bulldogs are now on a sound financial footing; Smorgon calls Gordon the “Charlie Sutton of the Bulldogs off the field”, a reference to the club legend who captained the 1954 premiership-winning side – and Melbourne is in rude health now too.

There is some irony that the two clubs battled for a key sponsor a decade ago – Mission Foods, which still adorns the Bulldogs jumper today. It had been a hard slog. “I remember going through the Yellow Pages one year, finding any company with a link to (Melbourne’s) west and cold-calling them to see if they’d sponsor us,” Smorgon recalls.

In early 2009, Rose got a tip from a Bulldogs-supporting lawyer that Mission Foods needed to build a factory in Melbourne and wanted to sponsor an AFL team – and the boss, Gonzalez, was in town.

“Mission supplied wraps and tortillas and the like to McDonald’s and KFC,” Rose says. “They were bringing them to Australia and got told they needed to supply them locally. So they had to introduce their brand here, and manufacture here.”

Melbourne, under late president Jim Stynes and then CEO Cameron Schwab, had met Gonzalez, presented the music lover with a guitar worth thousands of dollars and walked him across the hallowed Melbourne Cricket Ground turf. (One tale, perhaps apocryphal, had Gonzalez’s name misspelt on the MCG scoreboard.)

Rose managed to convince Gonzalez to travel across to the Whitten Oval, as Smorgon dashed up from his Mornington Peninsula holiday home. “This black limo turns up. Mr Gonzalez gets out and within 10 minutes Campbell leans over and says ‘he thinks you’re the owner of the club so you’ll need to deal with him’.”

The pair would have dinner and, after Rose presented Gonzalez with Bulldogs tops for he and his family, then an anxious 10-day wait, Mission chose the Bulldogs ahead of Melbourne. It has since poured in at least $20m in sponsorship and remains one of the longest commercial partners in the AFL. The days of the Bulldogs skirting insolvency are over.

Bains says the 2016 grand final win “validated us as a club and allowed us to set our sights a lot higher than we have traditionally. We have that background as a humble community club but we are also aspirational commercially and on the field”.

Beveridge and Bontempelli are proof. Bains talks about Beveridge’s “emotional intelligence” as a strength. “There is a raw passion to that but for the people in the club, and particularly the players, not only does he support them unconditionally, he really believes in them. It is hard to articulate the chemistry and emotion building since we left Melbourne a few weeks ago. We expect to win if everything goes our way. There will be a great emotional outpouring to reflect that if it happens.”

How India’s Top IPL Franchises Performed Financially,"**Original source:**  [How India’s Top IPL Franchises Performed Financially](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/how-indias-top-ipl-franchises-performed-financially)  


(Recreating the entire article here as it is behind strict paywall.)

&#x200B;

The value of the  world’s biggest T-20 cricket tournament has nearly doubled in five years  on the back of three of its most dominant franchises.  The Indian Premier League was worth $6.8 billion (around Rs 41,800  crore) in 2019 from $3.2 billion five year ago, according to a report by  [Duff & Phelps](https://www.duffandphelps.com/-/media/assets/pdfs/publications/valuation/ipl-brand-valuation-report-2018.ashx), led by billionaire Mukesh Ambani-backed Mumbai  Indians, Chennai Super Kings and Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan’s  Kolkata Knight Riders.  

Among the three teams, Mumbai Indians and Chennai Super Kings have won  the IPL title four and three times, respectively, in 12 seasons. Barring  2010, Mumbai Indians have won the title every time they have qualified  for the finals. Chennai Super Kings have reached the finals eight times  and won three titles out of the 10 seasons they were part of. 

That’s boosted the  teams’ brand values, which have increased over the previous year,  according to the international corporate finance and valuation adviser.  Mumbai Indians and Chennai Super Kings are the top two valuable  franchises, Duff & Phelps said.  The brand value of two-time champion Kolkata Knight Riders, in contrast, declined  in 2019 led by inconsistency in the team’s performance and its failure  to qualify for the play-offs, disappointing sponsors and advertisers  alike.

IPL franchises earn  revenue through:      

* Grant of central rights.
* Sponsorship income.
* Gate collection.
* Other franchise income.
* Sales and royalty from merchandise.

The grant of central rights contributes the largest share of revenue based on the number of matches played, which is allocated on a pro-rata  basis by the Board of Cricket Control for India.  Mumbai Indians recorded the highest gate collections in 2018 though its central rights revenue fell as it failed to enter the qualifiers.

IPL teams recognise  their annual revenues in the year the IPL season concludes. That means,  the revenues of Mumbai Indians, which won the IPL this year, and Chennai  Super Kings, which was the runner-up, will be recognised in the  financial year ending March 2020.  As of 2018-19, Kolkata Knight Riders, earned the most in the eleventh  season of the tournament, posting a profit of Rs 132.7 crore, according to company annual reports and filings with Ministry of Corporate Affairs.

"In 2016 total EPL wage bill was £2.3 Billion from global TV revenue of £2.8 Billion (A bit more CL TV money too), while IPL wage ceiling in 2018 is ₹640 crores (£71 Million) from TV revenue of ₹3270 crores (£400 million). 82% vs 20%.","My point is that cricket players in general and IPL players in particular aren't paid enough compared to the money they help bring in and it is preposterous when old players like Bedi criticize the money players are getting. There is no price for a run or wicket or a catch. It comes down to your value to the team and how many teams feel you can help them win games. While auctions are not the perfect mechanism they at least help in determining the market prices for the players.

This [guardian report] (https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jun/01/premier-league-finances-club-by-club) gives the details on EPL team revenues and their wage bills and Manchester United and Tottenham are the only two clubs which pay less than 50% of their turnover on wages. All teams together pay 2.247 of 3.649 or 61% of their turnover and not just the TV money.  EPL teams also make some money from Champions league and Europa league and that is less than £300 million 

I used only TV money because it is the most easily available numbers to us especially since IPL 2018 has not yet begun and we don't know the revenues of the teams. What we know for certain is that no team is going to pay more than ₹80 crores on their players' wages or ₹640 crores in total. The TV deal worth more than ₹16300 crores for 5 years means it is ₹3270 crores per year. This means less than one fifth of only the TV revenue goes to players. Title sponsorship deal with Vivo alone is worth more than ₹400 crores or two-thirds of the wage bill.

Even in American sports most of the time players get more than 50% of revenue as wages. Some people might argue that a lot of IPL revenue goes to BCCI which uses it to promote FC cricket and I hope it does but 20% of only TV money is nowhere close to 60% of total turnovers. Football players today get paid vastly more than what legends in 80s and 90s were getting paid. Same with NFL, NBA and MLB stars. Even mediocre players get paid more than legends of the past.

The top players in cricket make nowhere close to other sports and if we want to cricket to grown and prosper in old strongholds as well as new one we have to make it lucrative for those who take it as livelihood. Why would a talented athlete in England or Ireland for that matter chose cricket over football when he can make more playing championship level football than being in Test team. At least the IPL money will give him incentive to pick up and go on with cricket. For too long cricketers have got paid less because they played for national team and the revenue needed to be invested in grass root cricket. I agree with that but now that we have professionalized it let us give money to the people who bring it in. I hope the salary budget is changed for the next IPL and top players make north of 4-5 million pounds.

Sorry for using different currencies but as a reference £1 million is equal to ₹9 crores.

TL;DR Far from getting overpaid IPL players are getting underpaid compared to other sports and how much money they bring in.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/7th01p/in_2016_total_epl_wage_bill_was_23_billion_from/,samrat_ashok,2018-01-28 05:55:52,73,Cricket
"The Rise and Fall of Indian FMCG Companies - Nirma , Torino , Limca, Thums up and Gold Spot","In 1969, Dr Karsanbhai Patel, a chemist and lab technician in Gujarat, began making a homemade detergent product that he distributed to people on his way to work. It was not harsh on clothes and was much less costly than Surf, the dominant detergent in the market.

As people began liking it, Patel began manufacturing it on a much larger scale. He started the packaging in a 10×10 feet room in his house, and named the detergent powder Nirma, after his daughter Nirupama. The girl in the white dress on the packaging was inspired by his daughter.

Their marketing was top notch in the early 90s when they made ads with catchy tunes which even kids used rhyme at schools,

&#x200B;

>It’s simplicity is what made the jingle memorable — through various iterations of the advertisement, the phrase ‘washing powder Nirma’, repeated twice, has given it a high recall value.

&#x200B;

[https:\/\/in.pinterest.com\/pin\/771171136168750549\/](https://preview.redd.it/14q6ljx4cyi81.png?width=766&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fd740a8cb6c1887f688215079ca5ec53867d02f)

&#x200B;

Nirma was founded when a chemist from Gujarat, Karsanbhai Patel manufactured a phosphate-free detergent in his backyard and started selling it locally. That time, Surf (a product of HUL), the Pioneer of Detergents, had priced its product at Rs.15 per Kg. The door-to-door campaigns for Nirma in 1969 were very well-timed. By coordinating and streamlining activities such as production, distribution, and marketing, Patel was able to sell Nirma at Rs. 3.5 per kg.

&#x200B;

# The Fall

Inspite of such a good start it fell off the cliff, several reasons

* Nirma spent a meager 3-4% of its revenue on Marketing communications (Ad-campaigns) while other competing brands spent 6-8% on advertising.
* The rival brands have products across all price ranges to mitigate the input cost effect, but Nirma is available in only one category—value for money. This has proved disadvantageous for the brand
* Consumers began to perceive Nirma as an inferior brand due to its low price

While their marketing was top notch in the early 90s when they made ads with catchy tunes which even kids used rhyme at schools, they somehow missed the bus at the later stages

There are many such Indian companies which did so well in the 80s/90s and competed with established FMCG companies from the west. Here Nirma took on the Hindustan Lever Limited. By 1998 Nirma  had around 60% market share by then, selling more than 1.72 lakh tonnes taking off the major shares off from Surf (HUL)

&#x200B;

**Where does Nirma stand now**

In November 2007, Nirma purchased American raw materials company Searles Valley Minerals Inc., making it among the top seven soda ash manufacturers in the world.

Nirma Group started cement manufacturing in 2014 from a single plant in Nimbol. In 2016, Nirma acquired Lafarge India's cement assets for $1.4 billion. In February 2020, Nirma acquired Emami Cement for ₹5,500 crore (US$730 million)

&#x200B;

# Story of Soft drinks

Thums Up was created in 1977, after the American company Coca-Cola withdrew from India, due to regulations requiring it to disclose its formula and sell 60% of its equity to an Indian company under a government plan for foreign-owned companies to share stakes with domestic partners.

The Chauhan brothers owned part of the Parle company and already had two other brands of soda, Limca and Gold Spot, which were popular in India at the time. Thums Up quickly became the most popular and achieved a near monopoly among cola products in India during the 1980s, such as Campa Cola, Double Seven, Dukes and United Breweries Group's McDowell's Crush.

Ramesh Chauhan had developed the formula from scratch, experimenting with ingredients such as cinnamon, cardamom, and nutmeg. The company also wanted the drink to be fizzy, even when it was not ice-cold, so it could be sold by vendors. After much testing and experimentation, the Chauhan brothers and their research team created a cola that was fizzier and spicier than Coca-Cola. They originally planned to name the drink “Thumbs Up,” but removed the “b” to make the name unique.

In 1991, when the Indian government opened the market to multinationals, Pepsi was the first to come in. Thums Up and Pepsi subsequently engaged in heavy competition for endorsements. Pepsi advertisements included major Indian movie stars like Juhi Chawla, while Thums Up increased its spending on cricket sponsorship. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0zersewaiyi81.png?width=1216&format=png&auto=webp&s=036862e98be5db2df5b126c0aaa41775076f8b72

# In 1993, Coca-Cola re-entered the market, and the three companies competed intensely. Later in the year, Coca-Cola bought the Parle-owned drinks Gold Spot, Limca and Thums Up for $60 million. When these were sold to Coca-Cola, Thums Up had a market share of 85 percent in India

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/aoehz0k1iyi81.png?width=856&format=png&auto=webp&s=057ccf5cd12f12b5f26b41c4d81ddc9319ba0459

One is selling it for just $60 million but another thing is giving up on your hardwork of establishing a 85% market share.  This is another example of how most Indian companies concentrated mainly on local market, there was not much done to make it export oriented even a regional player lets say in Asia like in Sri Lanka , Bangladesh , Nepal etc

Where does Parle stand now in 2019, it had a 7% share of the global biscuit market, growing to 50% by 2020. As of 2020, as per Nielsen, it is the largest selling biscuit brand in the world 

# Torino

I think many in the South would remember this cool drink brand , also called as Color in Tamil Nadu

In 1977, as Coca-Cola was beating a retreat from India under the  provisions of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, Torino, an orange  soda with a prodigious use of sugar, entered the market in south India.  

“In no time, we had captured 90 per cent of Karnataka’s orange soda  market,” says Pankaj Lakhani, the second-generation owner and MD of  Bangalore Soft Drinks. Torino has since been re-launched in PET bottles  across Karnataka, where it has over 60 distributors, and Tamil Nadu,  where doctors still recommend it as a high-calorie fluid in summer.

Do you know any other Indian company that fell off a cliff ?

[El País] The struggles of Spain's national cricket team: from the concrete to a European bronze medal,"Original link: https://elpais.com/deportes/2023-11-13/las-penurias-de-la-seleccion-espanola-de-criquet.html
> 
> Concrete tracks, bricks and weeds. A confined space for the Spanish national cricket team to practice the second most popular sport in the world, after football, with 2.5 billion followers. Founded by the English and spread to Commonwealth countries, cricket will be an Olympic sport in Los Angeles 2028, alongside lacrosse, squash, baseball-softball, and flag football, but in the T20 format. The Spanish team has previously competed in T10, a shorter and faster format. In Spain, there is no federation, sufficient resources, or professional conditions for players. Some have lost their jobs for competing, while others had to leave the sport to avoid a similar fate.
> 
> They buy their own equipment, although they receive subsidies for travel. ""We are in the process of becoming a federation,"" says Juan Carlos Rodríguez, president of Cricket Spain, the organization behind several clubs. In Spain, there are only five cricket fields, all on the coast. However, this has not stopped the multicultural Spanish team from winning bronze two consecutive years at the European T10 Championship held in Cártama (Málaga).
> 
> Controversy on social media marred the team's success: they faced racism in a video showing the team listening to the national anthem. ""Our backgrounds are diverse, but we are all Spanish. We have players from Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, South Africa, England and Spain. If the sport is not accepted in a country, you have to achieve success with people who have known it outside,"" emphasizes the president. ""It didn't affect us. We just ignored it. We will continue playing for Spain,"" acknowledges Awais Yasin Ahmed (Pakistan, 32 years old) proudly.
> 
> Awais parks his taxi to play and train. Living in Cornellà de Llobregat, he comes to the space provided by the Badalona City Council whenever possible. He arrived in Spain in 2010 and has been playing cricket for the Spanish team for eight years. He also serves as a coach among the five friends and teammates of the national team who gather in Badalona to train two or three times a week for a couple of hours. All of them are from Pakistan, each belonging to a Catalan club, where there is an existing federation. ""In Catalonia, there are 52 male and female clubs. There is a global future here,"" explains Awais.
> 
> They all share something in common: they lived and were born with cricket in their home countries. Schools, colleges, village leagues, and neighborhood leagues. In Spain, they found each other. Some were from the same neighborhood and played in a parking lot in Sant Adrià. ""We have been together for almost 10 years. We are practically family,"" says Babar Khan (Pakistan, 24 years old) sitting on the edge of the training pitch.
> 
> They also face economic difficulties that come with the sport. ""When I leave the taxi, I am not making any money. And although Cricket Spain pays for the trips, the equipment is ours. We lack a federation,"" says Awais, a father of two daughters. He adds worriedly, ""Many have lost their jobs for playing cricket or have been forced to leave the sport.""
> 
> Hamza Saleem Dar (Pakistan, 28 years old) almost didn't travel to the European Championship. ""I am also a taxi driver. Initially, my bosses didn't allow me to compete,"" he says. He became the tournament's MVP. He has been living in Badalona for 10 years and started because his friends told him there was a cricket league. Now, he has been a player for the national team for over four years. ""We all work. And on the days we don't, we don't earn anything. For those who are married and have children, the accounts don't add up at the end of the month. Some of us have even received final warnings at our jobs for leaving to play,"" explains Babar. ""Some have been fired or couldn't compete. We are absent for several days every two months,"" adds the young player.
> 
> Babar has been playing with his teammates since 2014. He is also a taxi driver, and cricket is his refuge: ""When I am feeling down, I come here, and everything gets better."" He has been living in Badalona for 14 years: ""We train here with different friends from the team. The City Council provides us with this space, but we haven't been able to set up nets or arrange it to resemble a match. We only train the basics. We are waiting to see if they can give us something better.""
> 
> The training ground is nothing like a cricket field—elliptical and grassy. There are no necessary protections; they can't train at maximum intensity since a solid ball throw can reach 145 km/h and become a dangerous projectile. Among concrete blocks and stones, they set up their own stage on a cement track: a flat bat, some leg protections, and the ball. Without wickets—using a brick—no helmet or gloves. In Catalonia, as in Madrid and Seville, there are no cricket fields, only one adapted baseball field in each city. ""We have some places in Spain where we can train with nets. But some practice in fronton courts, tennis courts, golf courses, or in confined spaces. Where we can train, we do,"" comments Juan Carlos.
> 
> The last to arrive at practice is the fastest bowler: Raja Adeel. They communicate in a Pakistani language or in Spanish, although English is spoken in the national team's locker room. Among them is a computer engineering student: Malik Mati Ur Rehman (Pakistan, 20 years old), the youngest of all. His equipment is the most austere, as a complete kit can exceed 1,000 euros. They buy it from their pockets in Pakistan, as they can't find the material in Spain. Just the bat costs between 200 and 400 euros, although professionals reach 700 or 800. The difference among them, according to the players, is significant.
> 
> ""Athletes don't get paid anything. When they travel, we provide them with food, 15 euros a day, and subsidies cover flights and accommodation,"" explains Juan Carlos. ""We are in the process of becoming a federation, but we need 65 clubs in six regions, and so far, out of the 109 that exist, only 37 of them are registered,"" adds the president of Cricket Spain, an association created in 2001 with the intention of reviving the initial impulse of the group of British people who founded the Madrid Cricket Club in 1975. Born in South Africa to Galician parents, Juan Carlos discovered the sport at the age of eight and has been the captain of the Spanish team.
> 
> Affiliated with the International Cricket Council (ICC), they receive subsidies of around 450,000 euros, although they estimate the budget between 700,000 and 900,000 euros. ""It's not enough to sustain the sport. If the Spanish Sports Council helps us become a federation, we will have more resources and could also achieve greater sponsorship,"" says the former player. Currently, Cricket Spain has more than 4,000 athletes. ""We have grown a lot. We are becoming more competitive every time,"" explains Juan Carlos.
> 
> In the last two European Championships, they achieved third place. ""We received a message from the England coach in the last championship saying he was afraid to play against us. That makes us really proud,"" says the president. But the process has not been easy: ""We have lost important players from the national team due to work and injuries. We have fought, but it also teaches us that we have a team that can compete. There is a lot of talent,"" he continues. ""The Olympics are a step forward. We lack support in Spain due to lack of awareness,"" emphasizes Juan Carlos. Despite being in an initial process, the players are ambitious and want more: ""The result was not what we wanted. In the future, we can win.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/17upabk/el_país_the_struggles_of_spains_national_cricket/,teiraaaaaaa,2023-11-14 05:15:39,61,Cricket
Curious Case of SRK & his Business Ventures Journey (Part-2),"In my first post, I thought I covered basically everything that’s associated with SRK & his business Interests, however I seemed to have overlooked upon few key details about his businesses and other avenues of his earnings as well in a big way.

Here’s the breakdown of his other Business Investments/Earnings:

**SRK Website:**

I failed to find multiple supporting materials on this but based on a interview clip which I saw many years back and a supporting gossip post, I’m writing a gist of it. SRK actually launched his own website named [www.SRKworld.com](http://www.srkworld.com/), a complete entertainment portal back in November 2000.

The company that owned and operated the portal was Aryan Informatics which was named after SRK’s son. Apart from SRK, Juhi was the other investor in Aryan Informatics.

SRK wanted to give updates on the website to his fans about his movies/promotions/events/fan interactions. Fans can also buy some of the merchandise, etc.

But due to occurrence of dotcom bubble in 2000 after few months of website launch and portal’s association with Bharat Shah, the website as well as the company viz. Aryan Informatics was sold to B4U, a leading Bollywood based entertainment TV Network.

**Earning from the Movies:**

In 2014, SRK charged about 30-40 Cr for starring in a film. But in recent years, SRK has started to partake in profits instead of taking any actor fees upfront. For his recent release Pathaan, Shah Rukh Khan didn’t charge any fees for the movie and yet took home a lion's share from the earnings. Actor reportedly had a deal of 60% profit sharing as his remuneration from the movie. Since Pathaan was made on a budget of 270 Cr and makers earned a total profit of Rs 333 Crore, SRK was paid 200 Cr as his share.



[SRK's recent release Pathaan is currently India's biggest blockbuster and Bollywood's second highest grosser of all-time.](https://preview.redd.it/2q3yy3ekjo4b1.png?width=1045&format=png&auto=webp&s=5978ac7a30d00918a877131d36c55a86fc765d86)

**Streaming Deals:**

Not many people know about this but back in 2016, Netflix announced the mega deal with SRK a day after Amazon Prime Video’s launch in India. Amazon has stitched multiple deals with Indian studios including Dharma Productions, Vishesh Films, and T-Series on similar lines.

Netflix deal with SRK granted them the global streaming rights to the films in Red Chillies’ library, as well as any new movies from the production house that are slated for theatrical release within the next three years. Khan will also develop original content for the platform.

Transactional details about streaming rights were not shared with media outlets.

**Kolkata Knight Riders:**

We did go over who all were the co-owners in this team. But I missed on sharing the shareholding pattern of the KKR co-owners:

SRK holds 55% of the team ownership & Jay Mehta/Juhi hold remaining 45% stake.

The KKR Shareholding pattern changed quite a bit over the years.

Knight Riders Sports Pvt Ltd, which runs KKR, had following shareholding pattern:

2008- Red Chillies Entertainment Pvt Ltd(RCEPL) had 9900 & Gauri 100 shares

2009- New shares were issued at Rs 10 per share price to RCEPL- 110,00,000 equity shares

Sea Islands Investment Ltd - 50,00,000 equity shares

Juhi Chawla Mehta - 40,00,000 equity shares



[KKR Co-owners clicked at regional Airport](https://preview.redd.it/nzeppgdfjo4b1.jpg?width=682&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=320aaedefcb73a2d20be5dfd38f99ba85c66174e)

2010- JCM sold to SIIL(Mauritius based company owned by Jay Mehta) about 40L shares at Rs 10 per share price.

2011 - ED found new shares allotment & sale unfair. Thus, transaction was subject to third-party auditing.

Auditors told KRSPL that price should have been 70-86 per share(for issue of 50L shares of KRSPL to SIIL) & sale of 40L shares from JCM to SIIL should've been 83-99 per share. As per CCI guidelines, 86 per share value was evaluated.

KKR’s Operations Snapshot:

Knight Riders Sports's operating revenues range is INR 100 Cr - 500 Cr for the financial year ending on 31 March, 2022. It's EBITDA has increased by 63.97 % over the previous year. At the same time, it's book net worth has increased by 20.70 %.

KKR’s Revenue Model:

KKR has been the first IPL team to turn profitable, they broke even in March 2012. They have emphasized on scaling up the brand merchandising and also build an official fan base on the Manchester United Model.

Currently KKR, third most successful IPL team, are the second-richest IPL team in the league with a net worth value of INR 740 crore. They are only behind Mumbai Indians (MI), who have a net value of INR 803 crore.

1. Media Rights: BCCI shares 40-50% of their broadcasting income (TV & OTT streaming) to IPL franchises based on league finish. Trophy winner will get the biggest share of the pie.
2. Sponsorships: Sponsors have to cough up anywhere between ₹10-12 crore for their logo to be carried on the back of the KKR jersey and between ₹8-22 crore for the front. KKR earns about 20-30% of their revenue from their sponsors: MyFab11, Lux Cozi, Joy Personal Care, Money9, Jio, Royal Green, and Acko. Tire Company, Balkrishna Industries are the main sponsors of the team.
3. Stadium tickets and gate passes: Eden Garden has the capacity to host 80,000 people, is the third-largest cricket stadium in terms of seating capacity. Franchise also sells gate passes and adds more money to their wallet.
4. Merchandise Sale: KKR launched the ‘Shop KKR’ website to establish a strong connection with its fans. They sell trending products such as jerseys, shorts, caps, T-shirts, and keychains. In 2023, SRK launched the ‘Knight Club app’ to strengthen his team’s special bond with fans.
5. Prize Money: If KKR win the IPL trophy they receive about 20 Cr., for second place: 13 Cr, third place: 7Cr & 4th pace: 6.5 Cr. Half of the prize money is distributed among the players only.

**UK T20 Team\[The Hundred\]:**

Even though there is no update on which particular team Knight Rider’s group are after. I’m certain they are most likely eyeing London Spirit. KKR CEO Venky Mysore implied that he might want to change the name of his to-be Hundred team. SRK also has a winter holiday home in London from many years. He visits UK with his family & friends around December end, every year. SRK's UK T20 team has to be London Spirit.

In fact, Lords cricket stadium \[home ground of London Spirit\] is about 1.5 miles from his London Mansion based in Park Lane, next to Hyde Park. Current London Spirit Ownership has 6 co-owners, who are mostly England Cricket Board Offcials.

**Byju’s:**

Though SRK has been signed up as brand ambassador, there are speculations that he also holds an undisclosed stake in Byju’s. Just like his investment in KidZania India, we don't know how much amount is invested. He’s definitely holding a minority stake.

**KidZania India:**

A Mexican edutainment brand's first project in Mumbai cost around Rs 100 crore and was launched in June 2013 at R City Mall in Mumbai’s Ghatkopar area. The centre is spread over more than 70,000 square feet.

Another KidZania park is located at the Entertainment City in Noida with a standalone structure across three levels and 97,000sq.ft. Apart from Mumbai & Delhi-NCR, third park in Bengaluru will be opened soon.

SRK’s actual investment in KidZania India is unknown but he holds about 26% stake.

**Endorsement Deals (Advertisements):**

SRK started his endorsement journey back in 1988, when he signed up for Liberty Shoes since then he never looked back. After his TV stint won him recognition, SRK landed in Mumbai. One of his first assignments was an ad for Tata Tea. Interestingly, Khan returned to the same brand in 2013 with the Chhoti si shuruaat campaign for Tata Tea.

SRK is known to stick to quality brands for the longest time: his association with Hyundai has been about 25 years. He’s is often referred to as one of first employees of Hyundai India.

SRK’s endorsement associations with brands include Liberty, Hyundai, Byju's, Big Basket, Pepsi, Frooti, Whirlpool, Nokia, Dish TV, LUX, Denver, Airtel, Royal Stag, Sunfeast, Pan Vilas, Kent, Mitsbushi Air Conditioners, Goibibo, LML, Cinthol, Videocon, PharmEasy, Nerolac, DHFL, D'decor, Pepsodent, Jet Airways, Gitanjali Jewels, Colgate Palmolive, Signature, Sprite, Tata Tea, ICICI Bank, Streax, Omega, Hewlett-Packard, Hero Punch Power, Reliance Jio, Tag Huer, Belmonte, Mayur Suitings, Top Ramen, Bagpiper, Godrej, Emami and many more.

SRK's endorsement deal with brands such as Pan Vilas(they paid 20Cr back in 2014) was the biggest celeb endorsement deal of the time.

In the past, SRK might have been available for big national/regional brands but from past few years he's been eyeing foreign endorsement deals such as Dubai Tourism, Netflix, LG, Cadbury, FoodPanda, Burjeel Holdings, Disney+ Hotstar, Coca Cola(Thumbs Up), etc.

SRK's been brand ambassador for over 50 brands throughout his ad campaigns career. He said because of his earnings from ads and weddings, he was able to upscale his movie's production and execute the script in the manner it deserved. He charges around 4-10 Cr per day for Ads.

Why Brands prefer SRK?

According to a TAM report, he adds over 3% share of volume on TV with average visibility of 4 hours per day across all TV Channels. Based on another report, he rakes up to 6% share of television advertisement market.

SRK's been a pioneer and gold standard of brand endorsements. Thats why even esteemed global brands like Tag Huer have signed him up as brand ambassador for over a decade now. Recently, his son's luxury streetwear brand D'Yavol X was sold-out within hours even though the prices were high.



[Forbes India 2013 Cover emphasizing on Brand SRK](https://preview.redd.it/sl37nntpio4b1.jpg?width=550&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f30a3eeff4731a0a6537ae31f86b80acabc53589)

Director of Hasee Toh Phasee and ad filmmaker Vinil Mathew thinks SRK’s presence ensures maximum exposure. He says, “Shah Rukh Khan is the number one actor in the country. Any brand that wants to project itself as the number one product for its target group would want to associate with SRK. With him you also send across the message that you are the best just like him. It’s the best way to reach across the globe as well as to smaller towns. With him on board a brand wins the battle of perception.”

**Performing Dance/Skits at the Weddings:**

SRK earns a ton of money from heartthrob performances at weddings too. Various sources report that an SRK performance in the weddings range from Rs 4 to 8 crore. SRK is pretty picky due to his packed schedule and prefers to only accept opportunities from people he knows i.e. famous billionaire businessmen and celebrities.

https://preview.redd.it/pd3i7e4who4b1.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5e40def5e09574eb93c725d94091ea43f77643f4

Also, there are chances of opening a fashion brand including clothing & cosmetics division with Suhana as face and manager.

An absolutely useless analysis of the on-field adverts seen in an Aus-SA test match from 2002.,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqZgQz8b4Fk

What a lovely match, never seen South Africa decimated so hard on their home turf! I laughed so hard at Kallis staring at Gilly and Waugh, and then Gilly jumps down the track and smacks him some more.

Why do many Indian football fans blame cricket for the weak standard of Indian football?,"If you don't do so, you don't have to mention. I didn't say all, or even most, but many. And that's because whenever I hear a foreigner comment why a country of 1.3b can't produce a decent footballer, many comment cricket rightaway, with media attention being a close second.

Why should the Indian cricket fraternity support Indian football, which in a sense is a rival for their own direct business interests? It's like Amazon choosing to support Flipkart, absurd. Their interests lie in getting more people to play cricket and to watch cricket, because that is their business. 

The bigger question is, given the amount of money in world football, what has global football done for India? Absolutely nothing.

The world football system is such that Indian clubs can't pump in money. Any other business outside of sport, an Indian startup can aspire to be the best in the world in some time by beating existing competition from all over the world. In football, that's not possible, because the best club in India can't even play the best club competition in the world from a viewership or financial pov i.e. the UEFA Champions League, at even a qualifying level. So if you can't play in the biggest stage, how can you be the biggest? And if you can't be the biggest, why would you spend money like those that can be the biggest do?

Then comes the absence of scouting from the clubs in the biggest competitions. Given work permit rules, non-EU player limit rules, FIFA bans of players under the age of 18 moving to a different country (which doesn't apply for movement from an EU country to another), nobody's looking at India, or trying to boost Indian academies by imparting their technical know-how or bringing coaches here. The only collaborations we see are the marketing ones or where expensive academies are made for rich kids to spend on a Eurotrip irrespective of footballing talent. Basically, money-making strategies, with zero agenda of trying to find the next Indian superstar (which could've generated much much more money as more Indians view their games, TV and sponsorship money).

So, the next time anyone asks why Indian football is weak, more people should be saying the real issue which is that the entire football system is rigged against us trying to improve.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFootball/comments/jv1reo/why_do_many_indian_football_fans_blame_cricket/,adxx12in,2020-11-16 11:03:50,53,IndianFootball

Our love-hate, or hate-hate, relationship with this team is bordering onto Stockholm syndrome, but we are stuck here for the ride as the train keeps chugging along. Also a note for this one, the champion's trophy arc has been largely skipped over as it is just a mess of he said she said headlines. If I forgot anything, please let me know in the comments.

It felt like a bit less wild stuff happened this year, but if you remember something I forgot please do not hesitate to leave a comment. Pakistan cricket ends this year on a high with a question mark. The ODI team is clicking at the perfect time and we've found out how to win tests at home. The next couple months will be very interesting to say the least.

As always I like to give a shout out of sorts at the end of these. It started with shouting out Pakistan cricket redditors, but the number has grown so exponentially that it's no longer feasible. I would like to shoutout the Pakistani fans who stick through it. You are no fairweather fans who leave and come back when the going is good, you hate yourselves enough to stick through the worst of the worst. You know who you are and I salute you for that. As I said last year, one day we will be led to the glowing promised land as both a country and a team, and having gone through these years and years of harsh patches, the warm radiance of that light will be all the more warming InshAllah.

Samapti banerjee has started doing sponsored content. So disappointed.,"Her channel trailer still has the video that says why she says no to paid promotions and sponsorships which was made barely 8 months ago. She made this her USP. she got popular via this. said she is against affiliate code too. and now she's started taking sponsorships. just did one with plum and touted aloe as a magical ingredient.

&#x200B;

After samapti's ridiculous and mean video and her blind followers' dumb comments -

I actually used to watch her videos and look forward to her reviews [https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/mehfns/pulp\_indias\_new\_acne\_serum\_has\_an\_amazing/gskbm4l/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/mehfns/pulp_indias_new_acne_serum_has_an_amazing/gskbm4l/) 

No we arent jealous haters without a job. Most of the people here either have a job or are students. Ive seen so many medical students here too. We are not from the influencer field who are jealous of your success nor jobless enough to start gossiping about you without actually watching your video

I made the post about her sponsored video and honestly I am already feeling attacked. I never said she hid her sponsorship nor that it made her review automatically fake. I said this so many times in my comments. **I just said she was drawing the narrative that ""i dont do sponsored videos because money can make you biased. you dont buy from your own money so even if product didnt work out you atleast dont lose money thats why i dont do sponsored content. I get many sponsorships and i never reply to them. Im making this video for you and brands to know about my values. Even affiliate codes give you targets to make xyz number of purchases. I am considering a join button where people can give money only if you want without compulsion"".** There is another non indian youtuber called ""No BS beauty"" who does not do sponsored content or take PR and accepts support from her subscribers via patreon donations because they like her content. **Is it so hard to understand that if you go against the very values youre touting some people will be disappointed?** Does being anon take away your right to an opinion also? what the hell was that video. We did not make this account just to talk about samapti. When people were saying nice things about her, even then they were doing it anonymously. When someone posts their HGs here, even that is done anonymously. You're so pathetic to invalidate someone just because they're anon. The whole fkn reddit site functions under anonymity and people discussing their interests, whether it is cricket, skincare, relationship advice, science, makeup whatever the hell. And you know excela moisturiser, photostable sunscreen these have been available since many many years. I've been using them since 4 years atleast. But this subreddit got popular in 2020 March and that's when these products got popular. And suddenly all you influencers started reviewing photostable and excela, samapti maitrayee rubeena everyone. And then you have the guts to call the people here cowards, the same anon people you've have no issues using for your content and earning money in your side hustle. Slow clap. Disgusting.

And the other user who made the fragrance post too was right. Rose, lavender are fragrant extracts and she justified it by comparing it to centella extract which is just not the same thing??? Hemp oil has a characteristic smell but hemp oil or extract doesn't have fragrant compounds that can irritate skin. Rose extract is classified as fragrant extract and is not the same to things you're comparing it to. Paula's choice also classifies extracts depending on good bad average as another user pointed out in one of the comment threads. [https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/plant-extracts/rose-flower.html](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/plant-extracts/rose-flower.html) Thanks to user unlockbeastmode for the link [https://europepmc.org/article/AGR/IND43757641](https://europepmc.org/article/AGR/IND43757641) ""A volatile concentrate obtained from rose water (ex. Rosa damascena flowers) by liquid-liquid extraction with dichloromethane was studied by GC and GC/MS. The volatiles consisted mainly of 2-phenylethanol (69.7-81.6%), **linalool (1.5-3.3%), citronellol (1.8-7.2%), nerol (0.2-4.2%), geraniol (0.9-7.0%)** along with rose oxides and all other characteristic minor rose compounds.""

People who call you fearmongering over fragrance dont say youre forcing them to use fragrance free products, but its not a crime to call out misinformation. Just like spreading fear against parabens or glycolic acid (cough dr v cough) is criticised, so are you. Same way you are criticised to call a cetaphil sunscreen as having no UVA protection because you didnt see PA+++ but are not even aware about UVA seal. Are people haters if they're calling you misinformed or saying you repeat information from labmuffin and incidecoder? Your novelty was your own product experience, not doing sponsored content etc. Grow up and stop painting every person who disagrees with you as a hater. No one from here sent you hate messages, we just discussed among ourselves. but guess what you got hateful in your video and your followers started coming here with new accounts to ask people to get a life :)

And guess what? if calling aloe magical is a part of the brand script and not your view.. you are already being ingenuine in your review. Because it is not your own thoughts but the brand script!! And Ffs we arent content creators. Yeah we create long posts here but we don't develop a following or earn money via youtube for our watchtime. You are a content creator. Have the basic logic to know the difference between the two

more stuff i've said in response to her stupid video -

The post has since morphed into a story of the varying fortunes of three companies daring (or foolhardy) enough to embark on the very expensive journey of Formula One sponsorship: MTV Europe, 7-Up and Vodafone.


**MTV Europe**


Team: [Simtek GP](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C-nq-TJXsAAbbC5.jpg) 


Some users here (especially those who have been following u/DarknessPandemic’s excellent series about not so excellent F1 ventures) might remember Simtek as the firm that designed the chassis for the infamous Andrea Moda Formula One team. Well in 1994, Simtek themselves decided to enter the F1 arena. With a team of 35 people, Ford HB V8 engines from Cosworth, and David Brabham and Roland Ratzenberger as drivers, Simtek Grand Prix was almost ready to go. All that was missing was a title sponsor.


Enter MTV Europe. As part of this partnership, MTV [sent one of their presenters, Davina McCall to several races](https://vimeo.com/88888848). Yes, you heard that right. MTV used to cover Formula One. McCall talks a bit about her experience [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLnI9st0QSc). 


Unfortunately, 1994 was a disastrous year for Simtek. Not only was the car uncompetitive, but the team tragically lost Ratzenberger [during qualifying]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Ratzenberger) of the infamous San Marino Grand Prix at Imola.


MTV Europe's sponsorship commitment was reduced for the 1995 season, but they remained title sponsors to the team. Rather than money, MTV paid Simtek with airtime on their television channel. This airtime was then sold by Simtek to its other sponsors for them to show commercials.

**7-Up**


Team: [Jordan GP](http://www.f1colours.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/1991-Jordan.jpg) 


When Irish banker and occasional oracle Eddie Jordan wanted to move his Jordan team from the F3000 series to Formula One in 1991, he expected cigarette company Camel to come along with them. After all, Camel had been with the team for at least two F3000 seasons.


Camel didn’t, due to prior commitments with Benneton and Williams.


Eddie, not to be deterred, went to court PepsiCo subsidiary 7up instead. At first, it seemed that 7Up were uninterested in a foray into motor racing. They later had a change of heart which, according to Eddie, had something to do with Michael Jackson setting his hair on fire. Apparently the soda company had intended to sponsor Jackson’s world tour, but [the infamous Pepsi commercial accident](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCTt3bUCUzY)  had left 7Up with funds to bankroll an F1 team after all. I personally think that Eddie mixed up his timelines somewhere though, considering that MJ had his hair accident in 1984. 


Signing 7Up gave Jordan GP another headache though:  as Eddie thought the car would be Camel yellow, he had taken to courting Kodak – whose logo had a similarly coloured background. Upon finding out about the 7UP deal, Kodak refused to provide any support, as the green colours of 7Up were similar the colours of Fujifilm, Kodak’s main rival. Eddie being Eddie, jumped on a flight to Japan and talked Fujifilm into becoming a sponsor.
What resulted was this [iconic beauty of a livery](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/86/50/ac/8650ac7dfe3ea60cb175fcf27a5ebeb7.jpg) . The Jordan 191 is also fondly remembered as the car that Michael Schumacher drove in his F1 debut (Schumacher got this big break while Betrand Gachot was serving prison time for pepper-spraying a taxi driver). 


Unfortunately, partnership only lasted one season, with 7-Up being 
replaced by energy company [Sasol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasol). Eddie claims that, in a twist of irony, it was because Pepsi-Co had intended to [fund Michael Jackson’s ‘Dangerous’ Tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/5mq9hm/til_that_f1_lost_the_beloved_7up_jordan_livery/)


But it would not be the last of 7-Up’s time in F1, as the company would later return to sponsor [Williams](https://www.gpupdate.net/en/f1-news/30268/7-up-returns-to-f1-with-williams/) in 2002.

[It’s not easy being green.](https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/may-2016/66/its-not-easy-being-green) 


**Vodafone** 


Teams: [Benneton](https://racecarsdirect.com/content/UserImages/82047/459586.jpg?v=0) , [Ferrari](http://www.speedsport-magazine.com/media/images/meldeliste/zoom1000/scuderia-ferrari-ferrari-f2002-barrichello-4163.jpg) , [McLaren](http://www.blogcdn.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2009/01/vodafone_mclaren_mercedes_mp4-24_-_side_view_-_a4__300dpi.jpg) 


Vodafone’s first foray into F1 was a one-year contract with the Benetton team in 2001, the sponsorship replacing that of D2 Mannesmann (now called D2 Vodafone) which had been on the Benetton team cars for the past two years. Vodafone, like many other sponsors, had intended to use F1’s massive television exposure to promote its brand.


After the Benetton contract ran out, Vodafone held lengthy negotiations with several teams before joining Ferrari in 2002. (Benetton meanwhile was eventually sold to Renault, thus becoming Renault F1. They’ll make a brief reappearance later.)


This transition was not smooth sailing however. Eddie Jordan’s team Jordan GP sued Vodafone in 2003, claiming that the telecommunications company had reneged on £100m three-year sponsorship contract which would see Jordan formula one cars branded with Vodafone markings. Jordan sought around £150million in damages, claiming Vodafone broke the agreement when it was lured away by Ferrari. The case was eventually thrown out, with the judge citing ""wholly unsatisfactory witnesses"" whose evidence became ""more and more contrived and unsustainable"". 


2005 was a relatively bad season for Ferrari, with the scuderia losing both the drivers’ and constructor’s championships to Renault. To add insult to injury, Vodafone began to review its sponsorship deal with Ferrari, eventually choosing not to extend the contract beyond the 2006 season. Vodafone became McLaren’s title sponsor instead, signing a deal that was supposed to extend from 2007 to the next decade. This happy union remained unaffected even when Vodafone started reducing its involvement in sports sponsorship following the 2008 global financial crisis (Vodafone had taken to cutting ties with the English cricket team and the Champions League). In fact, the McLaren- Vodafone relationship would turn out to be the longest relationship Vodafone would have with any F1 team.


Our story does not have a happy ending. In 2013, Vodafone severed its ties with McLaren and left Formula One, believing that its brand no longer needed the reach and level of exposure that it gained through sponsoring McLaren. McLaren has been without a title sponsor ever since. 


All in all, Vodafone’s twelve years in F1 have been a fruitful affair. In six years, McLaren and Vodafone enjoyed 34 grand prix victories, as well as winning the 2008 world drivers' championship with Lewis Hamilton. With Ferrari, Vodafone enjoyed 48 grand prix victories and three world drivers’ championships with Michael Schumacher (2002, 2003, and 2004).

The Ambani and Adani Pavillion names have been so since 2019!,"I seriously dont understand how are people so shocked about this almost a year and a half after it happened, the renaming of pavilions at the new 'narendra modi' stadium was actually confirmed and made public in 2019, here's an article from [the indian express](https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/new-motera-stadium-sardar-patel-stadium-ahmedabad-3-types-of-pitches-6147331/) confirming the same, the quote;

>When asked why two pavilions at the new stadium are being named after the Adani and the Reliance Groups, Nathwani said, “Pavilions are named based on sponsorship received. Reliance has sponsored the North Pavilion, while Adani has retained their association with GCA by sponsoring the South pavilion.” When asked if GCA plans to name any part of the new stadium after Kapil Dev or Sunil Gavaskar, he said that the committee of the association will decide the same at an appropriate time.

Which beauty gurus do you trust the LEAST and MOST with reviews and why?,"These days, I realize I am getting more and more skeptical with reviews from the BGs I follow on Youtube/Instagram. I am sure more than a few of you guys are having the same dilemma, especially with the flood of sponsored videos (disclaimed or not). Let's share. 

**Least**: More recently, JackieAina - Although I find her pretty entertaining to watch, I'm starting to watch her videos less and less, because everything seems sponsored and while I respect the need for sponsorships to supplement their income, there seems to be a notable imbalance

NikkieTutorials- I still watch her for the artistry, with all that has happened, I can't trust that she disclaims when the videos are sponsored.

GlamTwinz: I do find they do a lot of  sponsored videos and they don't or rather didn't always see disclaim it in the past. Plus I have bought some recommendations back in the day and...\*crickets\* 

**Most**: Too Much Mouth - She says it as it is.

Alissa Ashley - For the most part she seems to keep it 100%

Wayne Goss- Another one keeping it 100% 

And..gasp..Tati, for the most part I like how detailed she gets in her reviews and idc I like Boobra... Not really here for the recent ' Clean Beauty' push, but I just skip the bits that gets into too much details. She seems happy to share her 'research' and whether I buy into it or not, I respect that this is important to her.

I also really like Beauty WithIn and Goss for skincare.

Device picture -  [https://imgur.com/a/Jl0nArQ](https://imgur.com/a/Jl0nArQ) 

Sorry I thought it is not allowed to directly mention the product name as it will look like sponsorship thing.  


Comments sections is kinda mess(sorry) so I will try to answer most common question here  


**What is the device in the pic? is it a TV?**

It's an Android TV Box which you can connect to any HDMI supporting TV.

&#x200B;

**Name of device?**

Xiaomi Mi Box S with EU plug

&#x200B;

**Is it available in India?Where did you buy it from?**  
No, I ordered it from Aliexpress as it is cheapest comparing to other Chinese sites and delivery was in 15 days with no customs. You can also use bangood but its little overpriced and accepts indians cards. **Price was 61$ around 4k rs**. Also there's gearbest..  


**Is it Chinese Version? Will the Indian Apps works?**

It is Global Version and your voice will work perfectly with google assistant if you select English(India).

&#x200B;

**Do I need to have mouse to use apps on it?**  
No, the playstore only contained dedicated app made for Android TV, you will need mouse if you are sideloading android app made for mobile.

&#x200B;

**Can I directly use pocket hardisk with it? What about Plex?**

Yes I tried using my 2TB hardisk and it works just fine( its usb 2.0). Plex also have dedicated app for android tv.  


**What about Prime Video and Netflix?**

Yes they works as intended in fact Netflix is smoother than Youtube with 4K HDR support.

Prime Video is officially made for android tv (Nvidia Shield) but it is not available on Play store so you will need to sideload it.

Screenshot 2 : [https://imgur.com/a/4bz0ITv](https://imgur.com/a/4bz0ITv) 

**Will it solve my Cable TV Problem?**

All TV networks have their own apps versions made for android tv especially Voot TV app.

**What about Live TV?Cricket?Can I watch News?**

Well there are some workarounds which I can't discuss here, you can install Jio TV app and news channels are already available on Youtube.

**Why should I prefer this over Fire stick?**

Honestly its your choice mate.  

You are getting a box with usb port and  Widevine L1. Stock android is always better than Fork of android. 

This is official android box certified by google with treble support so updates will be given as soon as they are released(currently its on android 8.1). Google store contain dedicated apps for android tv and google assistant is very handy which also supports hindi language. You can also sideload apps pretty easily from your phone and there also a remote app for phones to control tv which makes it easier to type information or pull information from phone like spotify logins etc.

P.S I tried playing few games on Kodi and its great also the playstore have games like Asphalt and Modern Combat.(copied reply from my other post).

**so What's the downside?**  
Well the hardware is solely made for purpose of watching content and works great for 4K HDR 60fps videos but if you are more on the gaming side then this is not for you maybe you should look for Nvidia Shield.

&#x200B;

**I don't think my parents will ever get used to it or maybe they will want to stick to traditional TV.**

Well as you can see the remote only have few buttons which is as simple as selecting option and pressing back to close it.  it's really great considering how my family now watches fewer tv channels shows, more YouTube videos and other online quality content. I am really happy to see them using the internet as they don't understand English much :) Mom watches a few cooking shows etc and dad watch online news from subscribed channels which are anytime better than tv. Yes, foul languages content is blocked and they check for age rating on prime video and Netflix. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Will it consume a lot of bandwidth?**

Nope as it is stock OS, there are not much background apps, the app stops as soon as you close it. I am on bsnl 3G plan as broadband is sucky here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b8gmbs/follow_up_on_the_ditched_cable_tv_post/,Slim_Python,2019-04-02 13:49:55,44,india

"Major League Cricket, with $120 million pledged, pitches a new T20 venture in the US","[Major League Cricket, with $120M pledged, pitches a new T20 venture in the U.S. - The Athletic](https://theathletic.com/3353516/2022/06/09/major-league-cricket-with-120m-pledged-pitches-a-new-t20-venture-in-the-u-s/?source=twitterhq) 

In the late 18th century, when Great Britain’s 13 North American colonies were desperately battling for their independence, soldiers in the rag-tag Continental Army would play various games while encamped in places such as Valley Forge, Pa.

One game was a form of cricket, a sport that would maintain relative popularity in the new United States for decades. Yet when another war raged across the new nation, this time a far bloodier civil war, a new sport had evolved that would overtake the decidedly British game of cricket – baseball.

Early baseball clubs nabbed some of the best American cricket players, and journalists started writing about baseball.

The rest is history: While cricket’s American popularity faded, it erupted across Britain’s global-spanning empire, particularly in India and the West Indies. That’s helped make it the world’s most popular sport after soccer – except in the U.S. of A., where even baseball was pushed aside for American football.

Various unsuccessful attempts have been made to re-introduce cricket to American audiences, and while it thrives at a local level in places, particularly those with large South Asian populations, it remains something of a distant, confusing sport to many.

Now, a monied group of mostly prominent South Asian investors have launched Major League Cricket with the intent of creating a professional league –  really tournaments that last six weeks or so – in hopes of capitalizing on the ex-pat communities of cricket fans across the U.S. The goal is to begin play in summer 2023.

Question is, can this effort find its footing and become a viable lower-tier property in the crowded American sports market?

Major League Cricket’s backers – the effort is formally American Cricket Enterprises – say they have the money, game format, built-in audience and business plan to make it work.

Last month, the group announced it had secured $44 million in Series A funding with another $76 million available over the next year. The money will be used to build or retrofit cricket stadiums and training academies, and for other start-up and development expenses.

American Cricket Enterprises (ACE) in 2019 landed the commercial development rights with USA Cricket, the game’s formal sanctioning body in the cricket world, to help finance, develop, and grow the nation’s men’s and women’s national teams – a vital relationship because cricket globally is most popular at the national team level rather than professional leagues. The deal means a long-term investment by ACE of $1 billion to develop cricket domestically at the professional, amateur and national team level.

That said, the development of what’s called Twenty20 (T20) cricket nearly two decades ago may be the thing that helps Major League Cricket find success. T20 is a shortened high-scoring version of the game, which traditionally was played in matches that took a day or several days to complete. It’s now immensely popular in India and other cricket-playing nations, some of which are developing even shorter versions of the game.

T20 matches are about three hours long – something American sports audiences are used to on television or in person. That’s the magic ingredient MLC’s organizers say will make it work domestically.

“All it will take is a casual fan to watch one of these games, in our stadiums or on TV, it’s so action packed,” Major League Cricket co-founder Vijay Srinivasan told The Athletic last week. “It’s a product that will stand on its own for entertainment for fans. It’s very high-scoring. It’s pretty rowdy and wild but still safe and family-oriented. It’s non-stop noise and entertainment and music, plus all the food.”

The world’s most-watched cricket league is the Indian Premier League (IPL), which is a T20 league launched in 2008 and is expected to soon land new media distribution rights reportedly worth more than $6 billion.

 

In T20 cricket, “guys are smashing this ball every which way.” (Photo: Pradeep Dambarage / NurPhoto via AP)

One prominent cricket observer agrees that T20 format can help make MLC work here.

“The object is to score as rapidly as possible. The scoring can be quite spectacular. Guys are smashing this ball every which way,” said Stefan Szymanski, a University of Michigan sports management professor and co-author of the recent book Crickonomics: The Anatomy of Modern Cricket. “It could attract interest. The problem is how to get people to start, to give it a go.”

(For T20 and general cricket rules/terms, visit here and here).

Initially, the league intends to market itself to the millions of cricket fans, particularly from South Asia, already living in the United States, Srinivasan said.

“We are very fortunate and in a unique position that we have a large and passionate audience for our sport in the U.S.,” he said. “We think we’ll be an immense success if we’re successful with that audience.”

Cricket fans living in North America tend to be wealthier and willing to pay to travel to watch top-tier matches, Srinivasan said.

“We have a good understanding where the audience for cricket lives,” he said.

Srinivasan in 2002 co-founded the Willow TV premium cable channel that broadcasts and streams cricket to about 4 million U.S. homes. He sold it in 2016 to India’s The Times Group media conglomerate but maintains close contact with its executives – including Satyan Gajwani and Vineet Jain, who are principals at The Times Group and investors in Major League Cricket.

Willow and ESPN are likely candidates for MLC’s broadcast and streaming rights for live matches.

At the top of the global cricket pyramid is the 10-team IPL, which gets hundreds of millions of viewers and match attendees. While MLC isn’t trying to be that league, its popularity amongst U.S.-based viewers signals that there could be an appetite here.

“These people had no domestic product in the U.S. to go watch a game,” Srinivasan said. “These things led us to believe the time is right for a home grown product.”

That helped Srinivasan and other organizers to successfully pitch the MLC idea to investors, some of whom will become team owners in the single-entity structure league (akin to Major League Soccer, which doesn’t have franchised clubs).

“That’s the expectation as we formalize league structure,” Srinivasan said. “The investors will morph into a well-defined ownership group, take on next stage of growth, more investment of teams.”

The internal financial modeling predicts the new league will break even or turn a profit within five to seven years – something Srinivasan said the investors understand. Among the business executives and tech entrepreneurs putting money into MLC, perhaps the most high-profile investor name is Satya Nadella, the Microsoft CEO and executive chairman. Adobe Inc. CEO and Chairman Shantanu Narayen is investing, too.

Also among the investors is Ross Perot Jr., son of the 1992 presidential candidate and tech billionaire Ross Perot Sr.

The $120 million will be used to build, retrofit or upgrade cricket grounds and training academies in several announced markets – Dallas, Seattle, San Jose, Orange County, Calif., and Morrisville, N.C. Another possible site is in Houston, and more stadiums or locations are being scouted in the Northeast, where there are already pockets of cricket fans and players.

The venues will seat 6,000 to 10,000 fans, or more, with temporary seating expansion possible for major events. The game-day experience will be familiar to fans of other sports: Rowdy cheering, music and entertainment, food and drink, etc.

Is the $120 million pledged to launch Major League Cricket enough?

“I think with the funding commitment we have, we’ll be set for the first few years of the league and the infrastructure work we’re envisioning,” Srinivasan said.

Additional revenue will come from corporate advertising deals, venue naming rights and media broadcast rights contracts, merchandise sales, data, fantasy sports, gambling, and game-day cash from tickets and concessions.

The organization’s 26-team semi-pro Minor League Cricket, which begins its 10-week season June 25 in 20 cities, launched in 2021 and has sponsorship deals with Toyota and Sunoco.

The MLC season structure is still under development but likely will include up to 30 matches per team. Organizers are trying to find the calendar sweet spot that allows IPL and players in other top competitions to play in the U.S.

Top pro cricketers earn about $1 million or more for a season, with many players earning a few hundred thousand dollars for various tournaments. Without revealing pay structure details, MLC backers say player compensation will be on par with the cricket competitions a step below the Indian Premier League.

Cricket professionals typically play for their national team as their top gig, and they play in several professional leagues/tournaments each year. They’re not bound to a single club, but while the money is pretty good it’s still not on par for most with what the legacy U.S. major leagues pay their players.

“No cricketer gets paid like a professional baseball player,” Szymanski said.

Which is ironic, given cricket’s early ties to baseball.

“Most of the early baseball players were cricketers,” Szymanski said. “Henry Chadwick, the father of baseball himself, began life as a cricket journalist and remained so.”

The Cincinnati Red Stockings famously hired cricketer Harry Wright to pitch, field, and manage. The future Cooperstown enshrinee led an unsuccessful baseball/cricket tour of England in the 1870s, but it was evident by then that the money was in the American game.

“Baseball offered a more profitable opportunity,” Szymanski said.

Elsewhere in the world, cricket tended to follow expansion of the British empire, and remained popular after that empire receded and nations achieved independence.

“If we’d successfully suppressed the rebellion, Americans would be playing cricket,” said the British-born Szymanski, chuckling.

But they didn’t suppress cricket. Baseball did. And that’s a test for trying to reintroduce the game beyond ex-pat followers and their family and friends.

“Launching a cricket league in the United States is something that is going to present a challenge for anybody,” Szymanski said. “They’ve identified a niche market of Indian expats who are likely to be interested and that is potentially a very good market. Most Indians in India are obsessed with cricket. It goes beyond anything you see in American sports and even soccer in terms of committed fandom. These star players rise to the level of a god. Whether it catches on here in America is a question mark.”

MLC potentially has an in-road with American audiences via a developing partnership with Jimmy “Jomboy” O’Brien, founder of a popular sports-based social media empire and a relatively recent fan of cricket. His Jomboy Media company has done some content work with MLC, and O’Brien produced cricket educational content.

O’Brien said he lived for a couple of years in Australia as a boy and played sandlot cricket with friends. After many years away from it, his interest was again piqued last fall when his son was born, and daytime TV sports during his paternity leave included cricket.

“I got super into it,” O’Brien said. “It’s a bat-to-ball skill sport. It’s s a lot of thinking and strategy. A lot of that is similar to why I like baseball.”

One reason I enjoy cricket is that 'action' happens on even the 'nothing' balls (pitches)

The runners can run at all times so the wicket-keeper (catcher) is always diving to stop the ball.

Even if its barely hit, they can still get a run & force defense to make a play [pic.twitter.com/ItvQXSaXzr](https://pic.twitter.com/ItvQXSaXzr)

— Jomboy (@Jomboy\_) March 26, 2022

He’s aware of MLC’s plans and expects to eventually have formal talks with its backers on potential formal affiliation. Does he think Major League Cricket can make it?

“It’s going to be really tough and I’m glad they’re trying,” O’Brien said. “If they get top players, cricket fans will tune in.”

That’s the plan, Srinivasan said. MLC already has signed professional players to participate in the inaugural season, but names haven’t been disclosed.

Because of the T20’s popularity, competition for the world’s best players will be fierce and potentially costly. But if MLC wants legitimacy with the domestic audience, it will have to pay for talent.

There are about 4 million people from India or of Indian descent, and nearly 500,000 from Pakistan, living in the United States, per Census data. There are also pockets of cricket fans from the sport’s other powerhouse nations – England, the West Indies (the Caribbean island nations collectively play under that name), Sri Lanka, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, and Afghanistan.

There are roughly 200,000 cricket players in the U.S. participating in more than 400 local leagues, tournaments, academies, college and school program, per USA Cricket.

American Cricket Enterprises has to get a sizeable chunk of these fans and players to tune in or attend MLC matches.

“A challenge is to convince the local population of the merits of the sport,” said Joel Seymour-Hyde, managing director of the British office of Octagon, the global sports and entertainment marketing, consultant, and talent agency. “Can you create a product that’s good enough locally to fill stadiums to create and atmosphere and buzz?”

Expectations and internal success metrics are key.

“You’ve got to set realistic goals and not assume you can be the fourth biggest sport in the U.S. in five or ten years’ time,” Seymour-Hyde said. “You don’t have to be huge to be a successful commercial operation.”

Szymanski echoed those sentiments.

“At some level, cricket leagues in the U.S. are viable. The question is whether it will be a small niche activity or gain a wider appreciation in American society,” he said. “If you aim to match the NFL in level of interest in the near future then you’re doomed to disappointment and failure pretty quickly. There also is peril in not being ambitious enough. You’ve seen that to some extent in MLS. It’s where old European players go to die – that has hurt MLS.”

The graveyard of failed sports leagues in America is pretty crowded, and the road to profitability (or just breaking even) can be long. Failure occurs for myriad reasons – some beyond anyone’s control, such as COVID-19 wrecking many sports endeavors in 2020.

“(The pandemic) did probably set back the league from 2022 to 2023. What that gave us is a timeframe to get some of our venues in place by then,” Srinivasan said. “We’ve managed to get out feet wet in terms of organizing events of a national scale, with player contracting and getting our venues ready.”

Another obstacle for non-fans is cricket’s rules and terminology. And cricket’s reputation is that of a sport that can take literally days to play and employs a terminology foreign to U.S. fans of the other major leagues. What’s a wicket, over, and innings?

“You have to drop some of the words – the toughest thing is the language of the sport,” O’Brien said. “Slang has become the official definition of things.”

Cricket education also is part of MLC’s business plan.

On the upside, the endeavor is happening at a time when TV networks and tech giants are spending princely sums for live sports content to populate their streaming services. Last year, for example, ESPN inked a five-year, $10 million-plus steaming rights contract with Cricket West Indies, a deal that includes 58 T20 matches.

MLC could enjoy a similar deal, and said an announcement is coming soon. ESPN and Willow TV are the obvious leading contender for such rights deals. ESPN parent Disney bought the CricInfo website in 2007 and today the u/espncricinfo Twitter account has 6.6 million followers.

Television and streaming are key to making MLC work. The U.S. is often second after India when it comes to TV audience for cricket’s internationally televised tournaments, Seymour-Hyde said, and that’s driven by the ex-pat population. And the fact that cadre of fans lives in the United States is even more enticing to organizers, even if many sports – soccer, rugby, lacrosse – also are trying to carve out niches.

Srinivasan said studies show that the potential U.S. cricket audience is more than 10 million and perhaps up to 20 million viewers. That many eyeballs would certainly interest advertisers.

While MLC’s deal with USA Cricket includes help for both the men’s and women’s national teams, the pro league will begin as men’s only. The venues and academies will be available for potential women’s teams and leagues, the group said.

Also potentially giving MLC a leg up is cricket’s T20 World Cup, which the United States and West Indies will co-host in 2024. “All eyes of the world of cricket will be on the US in ’24,” Srinivasan said.

While the challenges are evident, the fact that there’s a sizeable ex-pat audience, the coming T20 World Cup, the media industry’s thirst for live sports content, and cricket potentially returning to Olympic competition – it was last played in the 1900 Summer Games in Paris – looks to be an alignment of stars for Major League Cricket.

“A good as moment as they could find to give it a go. I don’t think you can see a better opportunity,” Seymour-Hyde said.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/v8x152/major_league_cricket_with_120_million_pledged/,abracadabrac,2022-06-10 07:12:18,42,Cricket
A new report from e4m now claims that Star India will continue to operate JioCinema for mass content and use Hotstar for premium content after the merger. ,"Here's the article: 

According to sources, Viacom18-Disney Star merger plans two apps—Disney+ Hotstar for premium and JioCinema for mass content segmentation.  

The $8.5 billion merger between Viacom18 and Disney Star is poised to redefine the Indian OTT landscape, but significant internal shifts are also underway. According to sources close to developments, the merged entity plans to go ahead with two distinct apps- a premium platform, likely Disney+ Hotstar, and a freemium service via JioCinema.

Experts suggest that a dual-platform approach aims to streamline content offerings, ensuring a clearer distinction between high-end and mass-market content. This strategy according to them will enhance targeting for advertisers, offering them more precise audience segments while preventing content clutter across the platforms

“A single app with too much content spanning entertainment, sports, and other genres can overwhelm users, making it challenging to navigate and find relevant content. This could lead to higher churn rates if users find the experience cumbersome,” said a media planner. 

According to some media buying and planning experts, premium entertainment audiences and sports enthusiasts often have distinct viewing habits. Merging these into one platform could dilute the user experience for both groups, making it harder to cater effectively to their specific needs.

Sources also indicate that the Disney-Reliance joint venture (JV) will introduce a segmented approach to sports offerings. While a media report previously suggested that all live sporting events under the merged entity, including the Indian Premier League (IPL), will be available, sources clarify this may be only partially accurate. While IPL, a premium property, will stream exclusively on Disney+ Hotstar, the JV plans to categorize sports properties into distinct tiers.

“One tier will house premium events like IPL, FIFA, and other top-tier leagues while the other will feature more regional or mass-appeal events such as the Pro Kabaddi League (PKL). This segregation aims to enhance audience targeting and advertising opportunities, aligning sports properties with appropriate viewer segments across the two platforms,” said sources. 

Elaborating on disadvantages of consolidating premium content and mass content in one app, a media planner said, “A unified app could make it harder to offer segmented advertising opportunities. Premium content and sports operate under different revenue models. While sports may rely heavily on advertising and sponsorships, premium content often focuses on subscriptions. Integrating both models within a single app could complicate pricing strategies and user retention.

As of now, Disney+ Hotstar offers a desi entertainment lineup with series like City of Dreams, and The Night Manager. On the sports front, Hotstar streams cricket events like the ICC Cricket World Cup 2024, along with key bilateral series. 

Meanwhile, JioCinema has carved out a distinct niche by securing the IPL streaming rights, which has been a major draw for its freemium model. Beyond cricket, JioCinema's content library includes global football events like FIFA tournaments and La Liga. Additionally, JioCinema houses HBO content, making it a key player in the entertainment segment by offering popular shows and series, further enhancing its appeal to a broader audience. IPs like Bigg Boss are also major viewership drivers for the platform.

While Disney+ Hotstar declined to comment, a query sent to JioCinema did not receive any response by the time this story was published.

"I am for equality for women, but i am against Sarkeesian and Alexander and Quinn... My take on why many of us fall into this category. Maybe a post for women to read?","raise of hands among the men here - who is against equality for women?

i would imagine that the crickets have become quite loud and there's not a hand to be seen.

so why would i be against the women in this #gamergate dustup?  how could i take sides against them?

imo, because they are not worthy of support... and they're actually not worthy of feminism - and they're giving it a bad name.  they're certainly making ME dislike the term.

speaking of terms, i've only recently encountered 'Social Justice Warrior'.  LOL.  are they serious?  that's like a pastiche of a caricature.  and as far as i can see, their stock in trade is just being loud and obnoxious.  In flying the banner and hiding behind the cover of feminism while basically just attacking men and what they like and how they are.  That's pretty much their WHOLE shtick...  interestingly, they are surprised then when men actually push back.

---------------------

**THE PROBLEM WITH SARKEESIAN:**

her critical thinking skills and her arguments are atrocious.  basically, she manipulates and cherry picks to make an argument that she intended to argue... it is less about reporting on the reality of what she has discovered and more about just having an agenda and arguing it hell or high water.

her biggest flaw is attributing everything to the malice of men.  that all the problematic issues in games she sees is due to the innate sexism among the game creator men.  but there are lots of other explanations that explain certain phenomena in games as well as books or films and other narrative based experiences... she picks at the fact that women frequently lack agency but in most popcorn fiction, almost every character that is NOT THE PROTAGONIST lacks agency - and in actual fact, the ""tightest"" stories are those in which EVERY THING in the story is a reflection of the main character... that's the ""hero's journey"" paradigm that's so popular in the west.  the RIGHT thing to argue is that there should be more female protagonists... that is defensible.  but to say that because a secondary female character lacks agency and that that is reflective of some sexist viewpoint is just absurd.

essentially, she twists and reaches to make EVERYTHING about sexism when there are simpler, better and more true answers.

---------------------

**THE PROBLEM WITH QUINN:**

she has a lame little text game and she's playing the sex/feminism card to get attention for it.  and worse, the feminist pandering media is bending over backwards to give her and her game attention that it doesn't deserve.  in a marketplace that is chock full of better and more worthy works that get completely ignored.

she's at liberty to play the sex card.  but people are also free to call her on it and say that the game is lame.

----------------------

**THE PROBLEM WITH ALEXANDER:**

""gamers are over"" ?  lol... christ, talk about a brat.  if something is not exactly how she thinks it should be, it should simply cease to exist!  the ol' ""if i can't have it, nobody will!"" school of argumentation.... classy.

not to mention that it's fucking insane.  are ""sports fans"" over?  are ""cinema buffs"" over?  christ, so much of industry products DEPEND on having a loyal fan base like that... the existence of true fans who fuel things like magazine sales (how many laymen/non movie fans buy cinefx or fangoria or sfx or american cinematographer?) and who follow their hobbies on websites and such.  as main stream as things like videogames and comics are becoming these days, the health of all these industries depend on their devoted followers.

alexander completely misses that.  she thinks that the videogames industry that we know can be completely driven by casual gamers?  not unless everything turns into bejeweled or candy crush.

she's delusional, irrational and just angry.

fuck that.  why WOULD i be on her side?

----------------------

and finally, perhaps the thing that encompasses all of the above:

**THE PROBLEM WITH POPULAR FEMINISM:**

as evidenced in those three as well as websites like jezebel... there's a LOT not right about them... so i'll pick out a few issues that i have.

- the objectification of women.  they've got to get over it.  this is what men do.  PERIOD.  tits and ass will ALWAYS be important to men.  that is never going away.  and the odd thing is that while complaining about such objectification, they PLAY INTO it with their blood engorged vagina analog lipsticks and pushup bras and etc etc etc.  fucking have some goddamn consistency with your positions eh ladies?

you can't attack this without it being an attack on men.  this is SIMPLY OUR NATURE.  and if the media out there is filled to the brim with that kind of stuff you should address it as an issue of REPRESENTATION - that the male pov is ubiquitous and there should be more perspectives from females... that's FINE to fight for.  but to say that all this objectification is somehow WRONG... that is an attack on men.

also, people in GENERAL objectify others.  this is NOT just a male thing.  it's a human thing.  when's the last time that you thought about a cashier at the grocery story or mcdonald's as a human being with a family and feelings and maybe a parent that depends on them etc etc etc?  we objectify the people in our day to day lives who are not important to us according to their significance in our lives... they are THE WAITRESS, THE CASHIER, THE CABLE MAN, etc.  all we want out of them, the aspect of their lives that we are concerned with is that they fulfill their function!  without this kind of heuristic, we would be UNABLE TO FUNCTION IN THE WORLD for fuck's sake!

- rape culture.  i don't know what this is.  my group of board gaming, videogame playing, comic book reading fellows don't approve of rape.  are there a bunch of you guys out there that think it's peachy keen?  is there a ""murder culture"" too?  or a ""culture of mugging""?  criminals always have and always will exist in the world.  people we pass by every day are perpetrators of all kinds of crimes including rape, assault with a deadly weapon, drunk driving, etc.  doesn't mean there's a ""culture"" of it.

i have plenty of female friends.  none of them have been raped.  but when this discussion comes around, feminists freely throw out crazy numbers like ""1 in 4 women""... wtf??  is that including or excluding third world nations with genocidal civil wars going on???  Are they including when guys check them out???

And HOLY SHIT - IF IT IS TRUE THAT WOMEN ARE GETTING RAPED EVERY OTHER TIME THEY LEAVE THE HOUSE **GET A FUCKING GUN!!!**  get two!  get titanium chastity belts and electrified bras and don't leave the house without covering fire and a bowie knife in your teeth!  **I WOULD!**

it always astounds me when feminism purports to be about the empowerment of strong and articulate women but its most vocal constituents feel that they aren't even strong and articulate enough to say ""NO""!  and the conversation always devolves to getting men to change THEIR behavior, though the vast majority of us never touched a woman without her consent (if we've touched one at all that is - geeks representing and all).

how in the world is ""not all men"" not **completely apt**?

WHY is the discussion a plea to men of ""DON'T RAPE ME"" vs. a manifesto to women, ""DON'T GET RAPED!""  empowered.  personal accountability.  your fate in your hands.  where is THIS kind of feminism?  women insist that they're not weaker (though physically, this is untenable).  so don't be weak!  exercise your strength!  do WHATEVER it takes to be safe and secure!

if rape is as ALL FUCKING PERVASIVE as some of these chicks claim - i want to see MUCH less complaining and MUCH MORE DICKS GETTING SHOT OFF.

this is the real world.  we need less complaining about how the world falls short and more making sure that it doesn't step one inch past where you would have it.

for those in first world countries, especially in america, you have the liberty of girding your fucking loins and killing any motherfucker that crosses you.  if rape is THIS much of a problem, start preparing to murder some dicks in self defense.

ADDENDUM: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_culture#Criticisms  thank fuck - there are those in women movements themselves that are calling bullshit on this concept.

- blaming the victim.  feminists and feminist pandering media get this so fucking wrong.  they get it wrong as frequently as idiots who lose lucrative sponsorships complain about ""freedom of speech"" when they get kicked to the curb by their benefactors.

blaming the victim **WHEN IT'S WRONG** - when it is used as a JUSTIFICATION for a crime against them.  ""she was dressed like a slut so of course i raped her!""  this is clearly and unequivocally wrong and stupid and no rational guy thinks this is acceptable.

blaming the victim **WHEN IT'S RIGHT** - when it is used as a commentary on the wisdom (lack thereof) of the victim.  if some guy pulls into a crime riddle neighborhood at midnight with all the street lights shot out in his bentley, gets out to stretch his legs and count his wad of cash... and this person gets jumped by every gang member within a six block radius, beaten, mugged, stripped to his ass and left to die in the gutter... did this guy DESERVE this fate?  were the gang bangers JUSTIFIED in doing what they did?

of course not.

but at the same time, we are NOT WRONG by calling out the guy for being a complete fucking idiot!  most of the time, when i see ""feminists"" decrying the ""blaming of a victim"", they are using it against someone who is not excusing a crime but pointing out that someone is behaving stupidly.

**WHICH IS FINE!  AND GOOD!!!**

i've never seen anyone justify criminality.  but i see people calling foolish people doing foolish things.  and that is completely justifiable and unassailable.

if you're going to be an idiot, i can call you an idiot.  even if your idiocy made you a victim.",https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2i5s4w/i_am_for_equality_for_women_but_i_am_against/,GOU_NoMoreMrNiceGuy,2014-10-03 09:14:32,42,KotakuInAction

Puma cricket sponsorship,"I'm one of those weirdos who likes seeing what equipment each player has and who they're sponsored by. I've noticed in the last couple of years especially Puma, despite still making new bats, have dropped out of the sponsorship game massively. Even long-time sponsorships seemed to end suddenly.

McCullum having been a lifelong user of Puma stopped using them during the 2016/17 BBL. Mitch Marsh started with them in 2015 but after the 2018 South Africa tour went back to Gray Nicolls. Chris Jordan had used them for several years before switching midway through last year's BBL. The only guy holding on I'm aware of is Heino Kuhn.

Anyone know why Puma suddenly dropped out or why Kuhn seems to be the only guy they still sponsor?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/irsrbz/puma_cricket_sponsorship/,SquiffyRae,2020-09-13 10:49:16,41,Cricket

Poor Stadium Attendance at India Open 2024,"I wonder why attendance is so poor despite the India Open being a Super 750 tournament. This is even when Indian players are on court. 

I'm surprised to see the stadium barely 25% full given that badminton is the second most popular sport in India after Cricket, and the substantial media coverage, attention and sponsorships deals the local players receive (MasterCard and DBS Bank recently sponsored Shetty-Rankireddy and Lakshya Sen). 

Could it be due to the inconvenient location of the stadium? Could it be because (such that I've heard) that badminton is more popular in the southern regions such as Hyderabad and less so in the northern areas such as Delhi (where the tournament is being played)? 

If some of you could shed some light here, that'd be great, thanks!

Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI ) has decided to ban all forms of crypto advertising and sponsorships during this year’s Women’s IPL. The ban has also been imposed on tobacco and betting apps.,,https://i.redd.it/6fv6cmd0pjja1.jpg,caffeinated_dj,2023-02-21 13:38:48,37,indianews
And you wonder why Pakistanis get involved in match fixing,"Pakistan's domestic T20 tournament is going on right now. Apparently if someone plays every single match in this tournament, including the final, they will earn 170 pounds/257 dollars. Not 170,000, not even 1700. Just 170 pounds. 

That is absolutely pathetic. 

I got this from PakPassion btw, so it's a very legit source (they have connections all over the place with everything to do with Pakistan cricket). You can read the thread here: http://www.pakpassion.net/ppforum/showthread.php?t=175272

I also found this link that shows how much PCB pays its players: http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5juauQtarAYHIKuUnSxfFwkNEvNPw?docId=CNG.54772f5d47fa56c8bfc69755c8092bcd.31

That shows that the highest paid players get $3400 per month, or $40,800 per year. I wonder how this compares to other boards? Of course sponsorships get them a bit more money, but I think only a small minority of guys like Afridi or Ajmal get anything significant from sponsorships. $40,800 for the highest paid cricketers in Pakistan sounds pretty pathetic. I think even Bangladesh or Sri Lanka pay their players a lot more. Plus their top guys get a lot more money playing IPL etc.

It's no wonder these guys end up doing anything for money. Being a cricketer for Pakistan is probably the worst financially out of all the major Test playing nations.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1b6jcb/and_you_wonder_why_pakistanis_get_involved_in/,khanpak,2013-03-28 20:30:49,35,Cricket
The significance of India having a bigger presence at Budapest (and beyond) for our sport.,"It's fair to say, as a sport, track still lags behind NFL, NBA, MLB, Premier League in streaming and tv viewership and relevant sponsorship dollars. It's nothing new, this has been the way since I can remember. You know this. And there's always recurring discussions on how to save the sport from a casual fan perspective. 

I think we've been ignoring the sleeping giant (India) as a solution. I feel Budapest was the inflection point for Indian athletics. That 4x400m men's heat qualification into the finals means they are automatically qualified for the Olympics. That's a billion sets of eyeballs from India intently watching that event next year. The rivalry between the Indian and Pakistani javelin throwers will draw eyeballs from both countries as it does in India vs Pakistan cricket matches. 

Viewership: The 2019 World Cup Cricket had a unique broadcast audience of **706 unique million viewers**.  You can imagine most are South Asian viewers. The numbers are astronomical. We have to realize that every podium an Indian athlete makes, the growth potential of our sport in that country (by way of viewers, fans, and future emerging Indian athletes) just keeps growing. The future of Track&Field as a truly global sport is bright.

The County Catwalk Part Two: Blast Kit Rankings 2023,"As a special treat for Finals Day\*, I bring you the second third of my county kit ranking (part one [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/141cd1p/the_county_catwalk_part_one_championship_kit/)). Designed to thrill and amaze you for a warm up before the dull business of cricket (yuck), mascot races (Alfred pls win the club needs *something* this year), and ~~Bumble in a bad Elvis costume~~ pageantry, it definitely contains no bias whatsoever - unlike Finals Day, which cruelly denied Glos a place on the prejudicial grounds that we were shite.

The rules for this ranking are a lot more flexible, given a lot of kits are effectively glorified t-shirts. Purely aesthetics.

*Definitely not an attempt to elbow my way into proceedings

**The Blast**

19: [Hampshire](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/430676413230612502/1129715215349596300/HC_Kit_KitLaunch_T20_Carousel_480x380.jpg)

There are a plethora of yellow kits again this year which mostly all look bad but this one is just dull. Canary yellow, again, woooo. Normally I'd be a fan of the sidebarring but on this it just looks like a rubbish toupée on that uncle at a wedding who is being a bit too friendly to the youngest bridesmaid.

18: [Sussex](https://imgur.com/HJfqCKe)

I'm surprised at myself for this one. I like the colour and the camo pattern is fun but I can't shake the feeling that this has been Sussex's kit for the last 5 years even when it demonstrably hasn't. It's distinct and I like the aggressive reminder that the team is the Sharks around the neckline but too many betting logos for me.

17: [Worcestershire](https://imgur.com/kmFod8O)

Again, a Worcs kit that's not easy to find a photo for. Also a hint of ""first year graphic design student's first end of semester project"" to it, with the swirling patterns against an ebon night representing the darkness of man's soul when subjected to 7 matches at New Road. Not a *bad* attempt, just an attempt.

16: [Lancashire](https://imgur.com/spJfKCH)

By default I don't like Lancashire kits. Of all the pyjama kits, theirs have a tendency to look the [most pyjama like](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article11011627.ece/ALTERNATES/s1227b/JS84557596.jpg). The barring on the shoulders is nice, though they fail to fully distract from how cheap and shiny it looks and the chest patterning is just lazy.

15: [Middlesex](https://imgur.com/odXpA5e)

Points for playing in pink, but it's just a dull one note t-shirt. That double neck sponsor can get in the bin too. The club badge looks tackily ironed on as well.

14: [Somerset Batting](https://imgur.com/ajnQQ1t)

Absolutely loses points for having two kits, shocking behaviour. Which is a shame because this one's quite nice, despite its ""West Ham training kit"" aesthetic. Like a Magritte with betting sponsorship on the neck. Could have been a top 5 attempt, alas.

13: [Essex](https://imgur.com/pEX8hbC)

Massive improvement over the CC kit. Nice deep blue, playful splashes of the club's colours across the body like paint flecks, and the inlaid eagle pattern nice and big in the middle. The two neckpin sponsors are shite but unlike the attempts above they don't draw the eye away from the nice block font of the main sponsor.

12: [Somerset Bowling](https://imgur.com/XCz45qv)

Same as the batting kit, shame to waste such a promising shirt on a split premise. The colour gradation is lovely, the pink to grey to black, nice black inlaid v-neck collar, nice big club wyvern. Double betting sponsors on the neck again though. Be better, lads.

11: [Yorkshire](https://imgur.com/eCI0vd5)

Fuck sake, get an actual club photo. Other than that, reasonable effort. Huge sleeves, good blue on blue check effect, one small, tasteful sponsor mid chest. The white trousers are cheating though, batters will lose the ball against them.

10: [Durham](https://imgur.com/XB0sNHM)

Ahhh, a yellow kit with *character*. A good strong hue, followed by what I assume are claw marks from the lion? And some of them are blue. Do lions cause blue claw marks? Is this some kind of magic lion? I don't want blue claw marks on my stomach so 10/10 please don't eat me.

9: [Surrey](https://imgur.com/JGhXeVx)

Another mid ranking effort from Surrey, another good but not flawless design. Loses marks because they were wearing it when Middlesex chased that gigantic score hahaha. Lovely shade of turquoise, lovely patterning, I like the black trim. First of the properly good kits.

8: [Northamptonshire](https://imgur.com/EVlGGnL)

Ah now this is amazing. Nice dark blue with the grey-blue panels at the bottom is a great start but the trim inspired by the Gray-Nicolls logo is...well, inspired. That extra touch of the red trim around the sleeves just makes it. Cracking stuff.

7: [Leicestershire](https://imgur.com/iOPm4vv)

All hail the watermelon kit.

6: [Gloucestershire](https://imgur.com/8q7FgYs)

Lovely dirty yellow colouring to kick this off but you add in the black and white brushstroke effect patterning, the return of the broken barring on the sleeves and that gorgeous monochrome club badge and you, my friend, have a tasty kit. Just misses out on another top 5 effort.

5: [Kent](https://imgur.com/1Sr8fIv)

Astonishing kit, this. I love it to bits. The red and the blue shades complement each other perfectly, with the blue seam trim making the kit seem blockier and rounding out the gradation from left to right. A proper 2023 kit.

4: [Nottinghamshire](https://imgur.com/1hs8HxE)

I love a sash, me, and that green is the loveliest shade. Plays perfectly against that golden corn, and the white of the sponsors and the traditional Adidas striping just rounds it out. Fuck I love sashes.

3: [Warwickshire](https://imgur.com/CbVSoea)

Great patterning, great use of colours, massive club badge. Interplays together perfectly. I want this painted on my bedroom wall so I can look at it and be inspired to bowl left arm wrist spin like my idol, School Teacher Jake Lintott.

2: [Derbyshire](https://imgur.com/uuGMXxM)

Yes I know it's the same kit as last year but fucking look at it. It's fantastic. The colours are great, the falcon design is great, the light blue and yellow neck trim is great. Just a great kit, 9/10.

1: [Glamorgan](https://imgur.com/Qw2euqb)

That slate grey is the best colour in the whole competition. The yellow against it is eye popping, the many sponsors don't actually look out of place but rather part of the pattern as a whole - which I love. The block diagonals give you the sense that even Dan Douthwaite is bowling thunderbolts. Might genuinely buy this, what an effort.

Hey R/india i wanna know how can i help the Indian ice hockey team,">The Indian ice hockey team is scheduled to participate in the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) Challenge Cup of Asia Division 1 in Kuwait later this month. Yes, you read it right: the Indian ice hockey team. 

>**This squad is ""begging"" for money for the Rs 12 lakh required for whole trip. ""It is so tough to push sports like ice hockey when cricket takes up all sponsorship budgets,""** read a Twitter post by the Ice Hockey Association of India (IHAI) on March 5. ""We have a national team and are begging for money... Please support our ice hockey team travelling to Kuwait. We need to raise funds for the team. A 20k donation will cover costs for 1 player,"" read another Tweet. 

>So far, IHAI has managed to collect about Rs 7.5 lakh from individuals and adventure travel companies. It still needs around Rs 5 lakh to cover the total cost of participating in the IIHF Challenge Cup in Kuwait City between April 18-24.
